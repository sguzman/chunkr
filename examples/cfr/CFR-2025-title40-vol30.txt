# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 300.1
Purpose and objectives.
The purpose of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) is to provide the organizational structure and procedures for preparing for and responding to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants.
§ 300.2
Authority and applicability.
The NCP is required by section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 9605, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Pub. L. 99-499, (hereinafter CERCLA), and by section 311(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1321(d), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), Pub. L. 101-380. In Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757, October 22, 1991), the President delegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the responsibility for the amendment of the NCP. Amendments to the NCP are coordinated with members of the National Response Team (NRT) prior to publication for notice and comment. This includes coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order to avoid inconsistent or duplicative requirements in the emergency planning responsibilities of those agencies. The NCP is applicable to response actions taken pursuant to the authorities under CERCLA and section 311 of the CWA, as amended.
§ 300.3
Scope.
(a) The NCP applies to and is in effect for:
(1) Discharges of oil into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines, the waters of the contiguous zone, into waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the
United States (See sections 311(c)(1) and 502(7) of the CWA).
(2) Releases into the environment of hazardous substances, and pollutants or contaminants which may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare of the United States.
(b) The NCP provides for efficient, coordinated, and effective response to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants in accordance with the authorities of CERCLA and the CWA. It provides for:
(1) The national response organization that may be activated in response actions. It specifies responsibilities among the federal, state, and local governments and describes resources that are available for response.
(2) The establishment of requirements for federal, regional, and area contingency plans. It also summarizes state and local emergency planning requirements under SARA Title III.
(3) Procedures for undertaking removal actions pursuant to section 311 of the CWA.
(4) Procedures for undertaking response actions pursuant to CERCLA.
(5) Procedures for involving state governments in the initiation, development, selection, and implementation of response actions, pursuant to CERCLA.
(6) Listing of federal trustees for natural resources for purposes of CERCLA and the CWA.
(7) Procedures for the participation of other persons in response actions.
(8) Procedures for compiling and making available an administrative record for response actions.
(9) National procedures for the use of dispersants and other chemicals in removals under the CWA and response actions under CERCLA.
(c) In implementing the NCP, consideration shall be given to international assistance plans and agreements, security regulations and responsibilities based on international agreements, federal statutes, and executive orders. Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any applicable international joint contingency plans shall be consistent with the NCP, to the greatest extent possible. The Department of State shall be consulted, as appropriate, prior to taking any action which may affect its activities.
(d) Additionally, the NCP applies to and is in effect when the Federal Response Plan and some or all its Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) are activated.

§ 300.5
Definitions.
Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by CERCLA, the OPA, or the CWA.
Activation
means notification by telephone or other expeditious manner or, when required, the assembly of some or all appropriate members of the RRT or NRT.
Alternative water supplies
as defined by section 101(34) of CERCLA, includes, but is not limited to, drinking water and household water supplies.
Applicable requirements
means those cleanup standards, standards of control, and other substantive requirements, criteria, or limitations promulgated under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws that specifically address a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site. Only those state standards that are identified by a state in a timely manner and that are more stringent than federal requirements may be applicable.
Area Committee
(AC) as provided for by CWA sections 311(a)(18) and (j)(4), means the entity appointed by the President consisting of members from qualified personnel of federal, state, and local agencies with responsibilities that include preparing an area contingency plan for an area designated by the President.
Area contingency plan
(ACP) as provided for by CWA sections 311(a)(19) and (j)(4), means the plan prepared by an Area Committee that is developed to be implemented in conjunction with the NCP and RCP, in part to address removal of a worst case discharge and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near an area designated by the President.
Bioaccumulation
is the process of accumulation of chemicals in the tissue of organisms through any route, including respiration, ingestion, or direct contact with the ambient or contaminated medium.
Bioconcentration
is the accumulation of chemicals in the tissues of organisms from water alone.
Biodegradation
is a process by which microorganisms metabolically decompose contaminants into biomass and smaller molecular compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, and end products.
Biological agents
are microorganisms (typically bacteria, fungi, or algae) or biological catalysts, such as enzymes, that can enhance the biodegradation of a contaminated environment.
Bioremediation
is the process of enhancing the ability of microorganisms to convert contaminants into biomass and smaller molecular end products by the addition of materials into a contaminated environment to accelerate the natural biodegradation process.
Bioremediation agents
are biological agents and/or nutrient additives deliberately introduced into a contaminated environment to increase the rate of
biodegradation and mitigate any deleterious effects caused by the contaminant constituents. Bioremediation agents include microorganisms, enzymes, and nutrient additives such as fertilizers containing bioavailable forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
Burning agents
are additives that, through physical or chemical means, improve the combustibility of the materials to which they are applied.
CERCLA

Specified ports and harbors
means those ports and harbor areas on inland rivers, and land areas immediately adjacent to those waters, where the USCG acts as predesignated on-scene coordinator. Precise locations are determined by EPA/USCG regional agreements and identified in federal Regional Contingency Plans and Area Contingency Plans.
Spill of national significance
(SONS) means a spill that due to its severity, size, location, actual or potential impact on the public health and welfare or the environment, or the necessary response effort, is so complex that it requires extraordinary coordination of federal, state, local, and responsible party resources to contain and clean up the discharge.
State
means the several states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction. For purposes of the NCP, the term includes Indian tribes as defined in the NCP except where specifically noted. Section 126 of CERCLA provides that the governing body of an Indian tribe shall be afforded substantially the same treatment as a state with respect to certain provisions of CERCLA. Section 300.515(b) of the NCP describes the requirements pertaining to Indian tribes that wish to be treated as states under CERCLA.
Superfund Memorandum of Agreement
(SMOA) means a nonbinding, written document executed by an EPA Regional Administrator and the head of a state agency that may establish the nature and extent of EPA and state interaction during the removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and/or enforcement response process. The SMOA is not a site-specific document although attachments may address specific sites. The SMOA generally defines the role and responsibilities of both the lead and the support agencies.
Superfund state contract
is a joint, legally binding agreement between EPA and a state to obtain the necessary assurances before a federal-lead remedial action can begin at a site. In the case of a political subdivision-lead remedial response, a three-party Superfund state contract among EPA, the state, and political subdivision thereof, is required before a political subdivision takes the lead for any phase of remedial response to ensure state involvement pursuant to section 121(f)(1) of CERCLA. The Superfund state contract may be amended to provide the state's CERCLA section 104 assurances before a political subdivision can take the lead for remedial action.
Support agency
means the agency or agencies that provide the support agency coordinator to furnish necessary data to the lead agency, review response data and documents, and provide other assistance as requested by the OSC or RPM. EPA, the USCG, another federal agency, or a state may be support agencies for a response action if operating pursuant to a contract executed under section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA or designated pursuant to a Superfund Memorandum of Agreement entered into pursuant to subpart F of the NCP or other agreement. The support agency may also concur on decision documents.
Support agency coordinator
(SAC) means the official designated by the support agency, as appropriate, to interact and coordinate with the lead agency in response actions under subpart E of this part.
Surface washing agents
are substances that separate oil from solid surfaces, such as beaches, rocks, metals, or concrete, through a detergency mechanism that lifts and floats oil. Product and oil are generally to be collected and recovered from the environment with minimal dissolution, dispersion, or transfer into the water column.
Tank vessel
as defined by section 1001 of the OPA means a vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and that:
(1) is a vessel of the United States;
(2) operates on the navigable waters; or
(3) transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
Threat of discharge or release,
see definitions for discharge and release.
Threat of release,
see definition for release.
Treatment technology
means any unit operation or series of unit operations that alters the composition of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant through chemical, biological, or physical means so as to reduce toxicity, mobility, or volume of the contaminated materials being treated. Treatment technologies are an alternative to land disposal of hazardous wastes without treatment.
Trustee
means an official of a federal natural resources management agency designated in subpart G of the NCP or a designated state official or Indian tribe or, in the case of discharges covered by the OPA, a foreign government official, who may pursue claims for damages under section 107(f) of CERCLA or section 1006 of the OPA.
United States
when used in relation to section 311(a)(5) of the CWA, means the states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Island Governments. United States, when used in relation to section 101(27) of CERCLA and section 1001(36) of the OPA, includes the several states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction.
Vessel
as defined by section 101(28) of CERCLA, means every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water; and, as defined by section 311(a)(3) of the CWA, means every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water other than a public vessel.
Volunteer
means any individual accepted to perform services by the lead agency which has authority to accept volunteer services (examples: See 16 U.S.C. 742f(c)). A volunteer is subject to the provisions of the authorizing statute and the NCP.
Worst case discharge
as defined by section 311(a)(24) of the CWA, means, in the case of a vessel, a discharge in adverse weather conditions of its entire cargo, and, in the case of an offshore facility or onshore facility, the largest foreseeable discharge in adverse weather conditions.

59 FR 47424, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.100
Duties of President delegated to federal agencies.
In Executive Orders 12580 and 12777, the President delegated certain functions and responsibilities vested in him by the CWA, CERCLA, and the OPA.
§ 300.105
General organization concepts.
(a) Federal agencies should:
(1) Plan for emergencies and develop procedures for addressing oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants;
(2) Coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with one another;
(3) Coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with affected states, local governments, and private entities; and
(4) Make available those facilities or resources that may be useful in a response situation, consistent with agency authorities and capabilities.
(b) Three fundamental kinds of activities are performed pursuant to the NCP:
(1) Preparedness planning and coordination for response to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant;
(2) Notification and communications; and
(3) Response operations at the scene of a discharge or release.
(c) The organizational elements created to perform these activities are:
(1) The NRT, responsible for national response and preparedness planning, for coordinating regional planning, and for providing policy guidance and support to the Regional Response Teams (RRTs). NRT membership consists of representatives from the agencies specified in § 300.175(b).
(2) RRTs, responsible for regional planning and preparedness activities before response actions, and for providing advice and support to the OSC or RPM when activated during a response. RRT membership consists of designated representatives from each federal agency participating in the NRT together with state and (as agreed upon by the states) local government representatives.
(3) The OSC and the RPM, primarily responsible for directing response efforts and coordinating all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. The other responsibilities of OSCs and RPMs are described in § 300.135.
(4) Area Committees, responsible for developing, under direction of the OSC, ACPs for each area designated by the President. Responsibilities of Area Committees are described in § 300.205(c).
(d) The basic framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system) that brings together the functions of the Federal Government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.
(e)(1) The organizational concepts of the national response system are depicted in the following Figures 1a and 1b:
EC02AU92.000

[59 FR 47424, Sept. 15, 1994, as amended at 72 FR 31753, June 8, 2007; 84 FR 56670, Oct. 22, 2019]
§ 300.110
National Response Team.
National planning and coordination is accomplished through the NRT.
(a) The NRT consists of representatives from the agencies named in § 300.175(b). Each agency shall designate a member to the team and sufficient alternates to ensure representation, as agency resources permit. The NRT will consider requests for membership on the NRT from other agencies. Other agencies may request membership by forwarding such requests to the chair of the NRT.
(b) The chair of the NRT shall be the representative of EPA and the vice chair shall be the representative of the USCG, with the exception of periods of activation because of response action. During activation, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC/RPM. The vice chair shall maintain records of NRT activities along with national, regional, and area plans for response actions.
(c) While the NRT desires to achieve a consensus on all matters brought before it, certain matters may prove unresolvable by this means. In such cases, each agency serving as a participating agency on the NRT may be accorded one vote in NRT proceedings.
(d) The NRT may establish such bylaws and committees as it deems appropriate to further the purposes for which it is established.
(e) The NRT shall evaluate methods of responding to discharges or releases; shall recommend any changes needed in the response organization; and shall recommend to the Administrator of EPA changes to the NCP designed to improve the effectiveness of the national response system, including drafting of regulatory language.
(f) The NRT shall provide policy and program direction to the RRTs.
(g) The NRT may consider and make recommendations to appropriate agencies on the training, equipping, and protection of response teams and necessary research, development, demonstration, and evaluation to improve response capabilities.
(h) Direct planning and preparedness responsibilities of the NRT include:
(1) Maintaining national preparedness to respond to a major discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant that is beyond regional capabilities;
(2) Publishing guidance documents for preparation and implementation of SARA Title III local emergency response plans;
(3) Monitoring incoming reports from all RRTs and activating for a response action, when necessary;
(4) Coordinating a national program to assist member agencies in preparedness planning and response, and enhancing coordination of member agency preparedness programs;
(5) Developing procedures, in coordination with the NSFCC, as appropriate, to ensure the coordination of federal, state, and local governments, and private response to oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants;
(6) Monitoring response-related research and development, testing, and evaluation activities of NRT agencies to enhance coordination, avoid duplication of effort, and facilitate research in support of response activities;
(7) Developing recommendations for response training and for enhancing the coordination of available resources among agencies with training responsibilities under the NCP;
(8) Reviewing regional responses to oil discharges and hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant releases, including an evaluation of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations; and
(9) Assisting in developing a national exercise program, in coordination with the NSFCC, to ensure preparedness and coordination nationwide.
(i) The NRT will consider matters referred to it for advice or resolution by an RRT.
(j) The NRT should be activated as an emergency response team:
(1) When an oil discharge or hazardous substance release:
(i) Exceeds the response capability of the region in which it occurs;
(ii) Transects regional boundaries; or
(iii) Involves a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, substantial amounts of property, or substantial threats to natural resources;
(2) If requested by any NRT member.
(k) When activated for a response action, the NRT shall meet at the call of the chair and may:
(1) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM and recommend to the OSC/RPM, through the RRT, actions to combat the discharge or release;
(2) Request other federal, state, and local governments, or private agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to combat a discharge or release, or to monitor response operations; and
(3) Coordinate the supply of equipment, personnel, or technical advice to the affected region from other regions or districts.
§ 300.115
Regional Response Teams.
(a) Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of oil, preparedness activities will be carried out in conjunction with Area Committees, as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels that of the NRT, as described in § 300.110, but also includes state and local representation. The RRT provides:
(1) The appropriate regional mechanism for development and coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC/RPM during such response actions; and
(2) Guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and NCP.
(b) The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing team, which consists of designated representatives from each participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments (as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.
(1) The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, as appropriate.
(2) The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge or release. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the incident-specific RRT, including participation by state and local governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the designated OSC/RPM. The designated OSC/RPM directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release.
(c) The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs of RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for response actions, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC/RPM.
(d) Each participating agency should designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange for representation with the RRT appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to meetings of the RRT.
(e) RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of the OSCs/RPMs.
(f) Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide OSCs/
RPMs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC/RPM as specified in the RCP and ACP.
(g) RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and maintaining ACPs.
(h) Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all RRT activities. Each state governor is requested to assign an office or agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, make available, and coordinate state resources; and to serve as the contact point for coordination of response with local government agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), described in § 300.205(d), apprised of RRT activities and coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also invited to participate in such activities.
(i) The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs for the federal response to discharges and releases, and provide technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT should:
(1) Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local emergency planning committee;
(2) Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges or releases on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations, and recommend improvements;
(3) Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations of response operations;
(4) Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;
(5) Encourage the state and local response community to improve its preparedness for response;
(6) In coordination with Area Committees and in accordance with any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents in accordance with subpart J of this part;
(7) Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or releases outside the region;
(8) Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the region;
(9) Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend changes in ACPs;
(10) Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a year, no later than January 31 and July 31. At a minimum, reports should summarize recent activities, organizational changes, operational concerns, and efforts to improve state and local coordination; and
(11) Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program for announced and unannounced exercises.
(j)(1) The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific response team when a discharge or release:
(i) Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC/RPM in the place where it occurs;
(ii) Transects state boundaries;
(iii) May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, or to regionally significant amounts of property; or
(iv) Is a worst case discharge, as described in § 300.324. RCPs shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.
(2) The RRT will be activated during any discharge or release upon a request from the OSC/RPM, or from any RRT representative, to the chair of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be notified immediately when the RRT is activated.
(3) During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response assistance.
(4) When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency representatives shall meet at the call of the chair and may:
(i) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM, advise the OSC/RPM on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC/RPM specific actions to respond to the discharge or release;
(ii) Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to respond to a discharge or release or to monitor response operations;
(iii) Help the OSC/RPM prepare information releases for the public and for communication with the NRT;
(iv) If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC/RPM that a different OSC/RPM should be designated; and
(v) Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments occur.
(5) At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may provide facilities and personnel for communications, information storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.
(6) When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.
(7) The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair determines that the OSC/RPM no longer requires RRT assistance.
(8) Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of regionwide response effectiveness.
(k) Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, it may be referred to the NRT, described in § 300.110, for advice.
§ 300.120
On-scene coordinators and remedial project managers: general responsibilities.
(a) The OSC/RPM directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. As part of the planning and preparedness for response, OSCs shall be predesignated by the regional or district head of the lead agency. EPA and the USCG shall predesignate OSCs for all areas in each region, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. RPMs shall be assigned by the lead agency to manage remedial or other response actions at NPL sites, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(1) The USCG shall provide OSCs for oil discharges, including discharges from facilities and vessels under the jurisdiction of another federal agency, within or threatening the coastal zone. The USCG shall also provide OSCs for the removal of releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants into or threatening the coastal zone, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG shall not provide predesignated OSCs for discharges or releases from hazardous waste management facilities or in similarly chronic incidents. The USCG shall provide an initial response to discharges or releases from hazardous waste management facilities within
the coastal zone in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT)/EPA Instrument of Redelegation (May 27, 1988) except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG OSC shall contact the cognizant RPM as soon as it is evident that a removal may require a follow-up remedial action, to ensure that the required planning can be initiated and an orderly transition to an EPA or state lead can occur.
(2) EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges or releases into or threatening the inland zone and shall provide RPMs for federally funded remedial actions, except in the case of state-lead federally funded response and as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. EPA will also assume all remedial actions at NPL sites in the coastal zone, even where removals are initiated by the USCG, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) In general, USCG Captains of the Port (COTP) shall serve as the designated OSCs for areas in the coastal zone for which an ACP is required under CWA section 311(j) and EPA Regional Administrators shall designate OSCs for areas in the inland zone for which an ACP is required under CWA section 311(j).
(c) For releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, when the release is on, or the sole source of the release is from, any facility or vessel, including vessels bareboat-chartered and operated, under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD, DOE, or other federal agency:
(1) In the case of DOD or DOE, DOD or DOE shall provide OSCs/RPMs responsible for taking all response actions; and
(2) In the case of a federal agency other than EPA, DOD, or DOE, such agency shall provide OSCs for all removal actions that are not emergencies and shall provide RPMs for all remedial actions.
(d) DOD will be the removal response authority with respect to incidents involving DOD military weapons and munitions or weapons and munitions under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD.
(e) The OSC is responsible for overseeing development of the ACP in the area of the OSC's responsibility. ACPs shall, as appropriate, be accomplished in cooperation with the RRT, and designated state and local representatives. In contingency planning and removal, the OSC coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, Area Committees, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, decision document, consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response.
(f) The RPM is the prime contact for remedial or other response actions being taken (or needed) at sites on the proposed or promulgated NPL, and for sites not on the NPL but under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of a federal agency. The RPM's responsibilities include:
(1) Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of EPA, states and local governments, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and all other agencies and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP. Based upon the reports of these parties, the RPM recommends action for decisions by lead agency officials. The RPM's period of responsibility begins prior to initiation of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS), described in § 300.430, and continues through design, remedial action, deletion of the site from the NPL, and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. When a removal and remedial action occur at the same site, the OSC and RPM should coordinate to ensure an orderly transition of responsibility.
(2) Federal-lead non-Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, Record of Decision (ROD), consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response. Based upon the reports of these parties, the RPM shall recommend action for decisions by lead agency officials. The RPM's period of responsibility begins prior to initiation of the RI/FS, described in § 300.430, and continues through design and remedial action and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. The OSC and RPM shall ensure orderly transition of responsibilities from one to the other.
(3) The RPM shall participate in all decision-making processes necessary to ensure compliance with the NCP, including, as appropriate, agreements between EPA or other federal agencies and the state. The RPM may also review responses where EPA has preauthorized a person to file a claim for reimbursement to determine that the response was consistent with the terms of such preauthorization in cases where claims are filed for reimbursement.
(g)(1) Where a support agency has been identified through a cooperative agreement, Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA), or other agreement, that agency may designate a support agency coordinator (SAC) to provide assistance, as requested, by the OSC/RPM. The SAC is the prime representative of the support agency for response actions.
(2) The SAC's responsibilities may include:
(i) Providing and reviewing data and documents as requested by the OSC/RPM during the planning, design, and cleanup activities of the response action; and
(ii) Providing other assistance as requested.
(h)(1) The lead agency should provide appropriate training for its OSCs, RPMs, and other response personnel to carry out their responsibilities under the NCP.
(2) OSCs/RPMs should ensure that persons designated to act as their on-scene representatives are adequately trained and prepared to carry out actions under the NCP, to the extent practicable.
§ 300.125
Notification and communications.
(a) The National Response Center (NRC), located at USCG Headquarters, is the national communications center, continuously manned for handling activities related to response actions. The NRC acts as the single point of contact for all pollution incident reporting, and as the NRT communications center. Notice of discharges and releases must be made telephonically through a toll free number or a special local number (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) and collect calls accepted). (Notification details appear in §§ 300.300 and 300.405.) The NRC receives and immediately relays telephone notices of discharges or releases to the appropriate predesignated federal OSC. The telephone report is distributed to any interested NRT member agency or federal entity that has established a written agreement or understanding with the NRC. The NRC evaluates incoming information and immediately advises FEMA of a potential major disaster situation.
(b) The Commandant, USCG, in conjunction with other NRT agencies, shall provide the necessary personnel, communications, plotting facilities, and equipment for the NRC.
(c) Notice of an oil discharge or release of a hazardous substance in an amount equal to or greater than the reportable quantity must be made immediately in accordance with 33 CFR part 153, subpart B, and 40 CFR part 302, respectively. Notification shall be made to the NRC Duty Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-2675. All notices of discharges or releases received at the NRC will be relayed immediately by telephone to the OSC.
§ 300.130
Determinations to initiate response and special conditions.
(a) In accordance with CWA and CERCLA, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to act for the United States to take response measures deemed necessary to protect the public health or welfare or environment from discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants except with respect to such releases on or from vessels or facilities under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of other federal agencies.
(b) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil or CWA hazardous substance is discharged
or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States; or
(c) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any hazardous substance is released or there is a threat of such a release into the environment, or there is a release or threat of release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare of the United States.
(d) In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA or section 106 of CERCLA as appropriate, including issuing administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare, if the Administrator or Secretary determines:
(1) That there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment of the United States, including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil or a CWA hazardous substance from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States; or
(2) That there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment because of a release of a CERCLA hazardous substance from a facility.
(e) Response actions to remove discharges originating from operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act shall be in accordance with the NCP.
(f) Where appropriate, when a discharge or release involves radioactive materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act consistent with the notification and assistance procedures described in the appropriate Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, the FRERP (24 CFR part 2401) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological discharges and releases do not result in FRERP activation and should be handled in accordance with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear incidents subject to requirements for financial protection established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments (section 170) of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from CERCLA and NCP requirements.
(g) Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).
(h) If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request by the governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to coordinate all federal disaster assistance activities. In such cases, the OSC/RPM would continue to carry out OSC/RPM responsibilities under the NCP, but would coordinate those activities with the FCO to ensure consistency with other federal disaster assistance activities.
(i) In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the President, the FEMA may activate the Federal Response Plan (FRP). A FCO, designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of
impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). EPA coordinates activities under ESF #10—Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF #10 Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance activities.
§ 300.135
Response operations.
(a) The OSC/RPM, consistent with §§ 300.120 and 300.125, shall direct response efforts and coordinate all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. As part of the planning and preparation for response, the OSCs/RPMs shall be predesignated by the regional or district head of the lead agency.
(b) The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency to arrive at the scene of a discharge or release should coordinate activities under the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation with the OSC, any necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC until the arrival of the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate federal fund-financed actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the OSC is unavailable, the authorized representative of the lead agency.
(c) The OSC/RPM shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent facts about the discharge or release, such as its source and cause; the identification of potentially responsible parties; the nature, amount, and location of discharged or released materials; the probable direction and time of travel of discharged or released materials; whether the discharge is a worst case discharge as discussed in § 300.324; the pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact on human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the discharge or release poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States as discussed in § 300.322; the potential impact on natural resources and property which may be affected; priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the environment; and appropriate cost documentation.
(d) The OSC's/RPM's efforts shall be coordinated with other appropriate federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs/RPMs may designate capable persons from federal, state, or local agencies to act as their on-scene representatives. State and local governments, however, are not authorized to take actions under subparts D and E of the NCP that involve expenditures of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund or CERCLA funds unless an appropriate contract or cooperative agreement has been established. The basic framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.
(e) The OSC/RPM should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.
(f) The OSC/RPM shall advise the support agency as promptly as possible of reported releases.
(g) The OSC/RPM should evaluate incoming information and immediately advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.
(h) In those instances where a possible public health emergency exists, the OSC/RPM should notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) representative to the RRT. Throughout response actions, the OSC/RPM may call upon the HHS representative for assistance in determining public health threats and call upon the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and HHS for assistance on worker health and safety issues.
(i) All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and
facilities under their jurisdiction. All federal agencies, therefore, are responsible for designating the office that coordinates response to such incidents in accordance with the NCP and applicable federal regulations and guidelines.
(j)(1) The OSC/RPM shall ensure that the trustees for natural resources are promptly notified of discharges or releases.
(2) The OSC or RPM shall coordinate all response activities with the affected natural resource trustees and, for discharges of oil, the OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken.
(k) Where the OSC/RPM becomes aware that a discharge or release may affect any endangered or threatened species or their habitat, the OSC/RPM shall consult with the Department of Interior (DOI), or the Department of Commerce (DOC) (NOAA) and, if appropriate, the cognizant federal land managing agency.
(l) The OSC/RPM is responsible for addressing worker health and safety concerns at a response scene, in accordance with § 300.150.
(m) The OSC shall submit pollution reports to the RRT and other appropriate agencies as significant developments occur during response actions, through communications networks or procedures agreed to by the RRT and covered in the RCP.
(n) OSCs/RPMs should ensure that all appropriate public and private interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered throughout a response, to the extent practicable, consistent with the requirements of § 300.155 of this part.
§ 300.140
Multi-regional responses.
(a) If a discharge or release moves from the area covered by one ACP or RCP into another area, the authority for response actions should likewise shift. If a discharge or release affects areas covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.
(b) There shall be only one OSC and/or RPM at any time during the course of a response operation. Should a discharge or release affect two or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC and/or RPM. The RRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if the RRT member agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the designation.
(c) Where the USCG has initially provided the OSC for response to a release from hazardous waste management facilities located in the coastal zone, responsibility for response action shall shift to EPA or another federal agency, as appropriate.
§ 300.145
Special teams and other assistance available to OSCs/RPMs.
(a) The NSF is a special team established by the USCG, including the three USCG Strike Teams, the Public Information Assist Team (PIAT), and the NSFCC. The NSF is available to assist OSCs/RPMs in their preparedness and response duties.
(1) The three Strike Teams (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) provide trained personnel and specialized equipment to assist the OSC in training for spill response, stabilizing and containing the spill, and in monitoring or directing the response actions of the responsible parties and/or contractors. The OSC has a specific team designated for initial contact and may contact that team directly for any assistance.
(2) The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:
(i) Technical assistance, equipment and other resources to augment the OSC staff during spill response.
(ii) Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a worst case discharge of oil.
(iii) Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations.
(iv) Assistance in locating spill response resources for both response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international computerized inventory of spill response resources.
(v) Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises.
(vi) Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response equipment.
(3) PIAT is an element of the NSFCC staff which is available to assist OSCs to meet the demands for public information during a response or exercise. Its use is encouraged any time the OSC requires outside public affairs support. Requests for PIAT assistance may be made through the NSFCC or NRC.
(b)(1) The Environmental Response Team (ERT) is established by EPA in accordance with its disaster and emergency responsibilities. The ERT has expertise in treatment technology, biology, chemistry, hydrology, geology, and engineering.
(2) The ERT can provide access to special decontamination equipment for chemical releases and advice to the OSC/RPM in hazard evaluation; risk assessment; multimedia sampling and analysis program; on-site safety, including development and implementation plans; cleanup techniques and priorities; water supply decontamination and protection; application of dispersants; environmental assessment; degree of cleanup required; and disposal of contaminated material.
(3) The ERT also provides both introductory and intermediate level training courses to prepare response personnel.
(4) OSC/RPM or RRT requests for ERT support should be made to the EPA representative on the RRT; EPA Headquarters, Director, Emergency Response Division; or the appropriate EPA regional emergency coordinator.
(c) Scientific Support Coordinators (SSCs) may be designated by the OSC (and RPM in the case of EPA SSCs) as the principal advisors for scientific issues, communication with the scientific community, and coordination of requests for assistance from state and federal agencies regarding scientific studies. The SSC strives for a consensus on scientific issues affecting the response, but ensures that differing opinions within the community are communicated to the OSC/RPM.
(1) Generally, SSCs are provided by NOAA in the coastal zones, and by EPA in the inland zone. OSC/RPM requests for SSC support can be made directly to the SSC assigned to the area or to the agency member of the RRT. NOAA SSCs can also be requested through NOAA's SSC program office in Seattle, WA. NOAA SSCs are assigned to USCG Districts and are supported by a scientific support team that includes expertise in environmental chemistry, oil slick tracking, pollutant transport modeling, natural resources at risk, environmental tradeoffs of countermeasures and cleanup, and information management.
(2) During a response, the SSC serves on the federal OSC's/RPM's staff and may, at the request of the OSC/RPM, lead the scientific team and be responsible for providing scientific support for operational decisions and for coordinating on-scene scientific activity. Depending on the nature and location of the incident, the SSC integrates expertise from governmental agencies, universities, community representatives, and industry to assist the OSC/RPM in evaluating the hazards and potential effects of releases and in developing response strategies.
(3) At the request of the OSC, the SSC may facilitate the OSC's work with the lead administrative trustee for natural resources to ensure coordination between damage assessment data collection efforts and data collected in support of response operations.
(4) SSCs support the Regional Response Teams and the Area Committees in preparing regional and area contingency plans and in conducting spill training and exercises. For area plans, the SSC provides leadership for the synthesis and integration of environmental information required for spill response decisions in support of the OSC.
(d)(1) SUPSALV has an extensive salvage/search and recovery equipment inventory with the requisite knowledge and expertise to support these operations, including specialized salvage, firefighting, and petroleum, oil and lubricants offloading capability.
(2) When possible, SUPSALV will provide equipment for training exercises in support of national and regional contingency planning objectives.
(3) The OSC/RPM may request assistance directly from SUPSALV. Formal requests are routed through the Chief of Naval Operations (N312).
(e) For marine salvage operations, OSCs/RPMs with responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, or supervising these activities should request technical assistance from DOD, the Strike Teams, or commercial salvors as necessary to ensure that proper actions are taken. Marine salvage operations generally fall into five categories: afloat salvage; offshore salvage; river and harbor clearance; cargo salvage; and rescue towing. Each category requires different knowledge and specialized types of equipment. The complexity of such operations may be further compounded by local environmental and geographic conditions. The nature of marine salvage and the conditions under which it occurs combine to make such operations imprecise, difficult, hazardous, and expensive. Thus, responsible parties or other persons attempting to perform such operations without adequate knowledge, equipment, and experience could aggravate, rather than relieve, the situation.
(f) Radiological Emergency Response Teams (RERTs) have been established by EPA's Office of Radiation Programs (ORP) to provide response and support for incidents or sites containing radiological hazards. Expertise is available in radiation monitoring, radionuclide analysis, radiation health physics, and risk assessment. RERTs can provide on-site support including mobile monitoring laboratories for field analyses of samples and fixed laboratories for radiochemical sampling and analyses. Requests for support may be made 24 hours a day via the NRC or directly to the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator in the Office of Radiation Programs. Assistance is also available from DOE and other federal agencies.
(g)(1) DRGs assist the OSC by providing technical assistance, personnel, and equipment, including pre-positioned equipment. Each DRG consists of all Coast Guard personnel and equipment, including marine firefighting equipment, in its district, additional pre-positioned equipment, and a District Response Advisory Team (DRAT) that is available to provide support to the OSC in the event that a spill exceeds local response capabilities. Each DRG:
(i) Shall provide technical assistance, equipment, and other resources, as available, when requested by an OSC through the USCG representative to the RRT;
(ii) Shall ensure maintenance of all USCG response equipment within its district;
(iii) May provide technical assistance in the preparation of the ACP; and
(iv) Shall review each of those plans that affect its area of geographic responsibility.
(2) In deciding where to locate personnel and pre-positioned equipment, the USCG shall give priority emphasis to:
(i) The availability of facilities for loading and unloading heavy or bulky equipment by barge;
(ii) The proximity to an airport capable of supporting large military transport aircraft;
(iii) The flight time to provide response to oil spills in all areas of the Coast Guard district with the potential for marine casualties;
(iv) The availability of trained local personnel capable of responding in an oil spill emergency; and
(v) Areas where large quantities of petroleum products are transported.
(h) The NPFC is responsible for implementing those portions of Title I of the OPA that have been delegated to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. The NPFC is responsible for addressing funding issues arising from discharges and threats of discharges of oil. The NPFC:
(1) Issues Certificates of Financial Responsibility to owners and operators of vessels to pay for costs and damages that are incurred by their vessels as a result of oil discharges;
(2) Provides funding for various response organizations for timely abatement and removal actions related to oil discharges;
(3) Provides equitable compensation to claimants who sustain costs and damages from oil discharges when the responsible party fails to do so;
(4) Recovers monies from persons liable for costs and damages resulting from oil discharges to the full extent of liability under the law; and
(5) Provides funds to initiate natural resource damage assessments.
§ 300.150
Worker health and safety.
(a) Response actions under the NCP will comply with the provisions for response action worker safety and health in 29 CFR 1910.120. The NRS meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 concerning use of an incident command system.
(b) In a response action taken by a responsible party, the responsible party must assure that an occupational safety and health program consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120 is made available for the protection of workers at the response site.
(c) In a response taken under the NCP by a lead agency, an occupational safety and health program should be made available for the protection of workers at the response site, consistent with, and to the extent required by, 29 CFR 1910.120. Contracts relating to a response action under the NCP should contain assurances that the contractor at the response site will comply with this program and with any applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651
et seq.
) (OSH Act) and state laws with plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act.
(d) When a state, or political subdivision of a state, without an OSHA-approved state plan is the lead agency for response, the state or political subdivision must comply with standards in 40 CFR part 311, promulgated by EPA pursuant to section 126(f) of SARA.
(e) Requirements, standards, and regulations of the OSH Act and of state OSH laws not directly referenced in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, must be complied with where applicable. Federal OSH Act requirements include, among other things, Construction Standards (29 CFR part 1926), General Industry Standards (29 CFR part 1910), and the general duty requirement of section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 654(a)(1)). No action by the lead agency with respect to response activities under the NCP constitutes an exercise of statutory authority within the meaning of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. All governmental agencies and private employers are directly responsible for the health and safety of their own employees.
§ 300.155
Public information and community relations.
(a) When an incident occurs, it is imperative to give the public prompt, accurate information on the nature of the incident and the actions underway to mitigate the damage. OSCs/RPMs and community relations personnel should ensure that all appropriate public and private interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered throughout a response. They should coordinate with available public affairs/community relations resources to carry out this responsibility by establishing, as appropriate, a Joint Information Center bringing together resources from federal and state agencies and the responsible party.
(b) An on-scene news office may be established to coordinate media relations and to issue official federal information on an incident. Whenever possible, it will be headed by a representative of the lead agency. The OSC/RPM determines the location of the on-scene news office, but every effort should be made to locate it near the scene of the incident. If a participating agency believes public interest warrants the issuance of statements and an on-scene news office has not been established, the affected agency should recommend its establishment. All federal news releases or statements by participating agencies should be cleared through the OSC/RPM. Information dissemination relating to natural resource damage assessment activities shall be coordinated through the lead administrative trustee. The designated lead administrative trustee may assist the OSC/RPM by disseminating information on issues relating to damage assessment activities. Following termination of removal activity, information dissemination on damage assessment activities
shall be through the lead administrative trustee.
(c) The community relations requirements specified in §§ 300.415, 300.430, and 300.435 apply to removal, remedial, and enforcement actions and are intended to promote active communication between communities affected by discharges or releases and the lead agency responsible for response actions. Community Relations Plans (CRPs) are required by EPA for certain response actions. The OSC/RPM should ensure coordination with such plans which may be in effect at the scene of a discharge or release or which may need to be developed during follow-up activities.
§ 300.160
Documentation and cost recovery.
(a) For releases of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant, the following provisions apply:
(1) During all phases of response, the lead agency shall complete and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the NCP and to form the basis for cost recovery. In general, documentation shall be sufficient to provide the source and circumstances of the release, the identity of responsible parties, the response action taken, accurate accounting of federal, state, or private party costs incurred for response actions, and impacts and potential impacts to the public health and welfare and the environment. Where applicable, documentation shall state when the NRC received notification of a release of a reportable quantity.
(2) The information and reports obtained by the lead agency for Fund-financed response actions shall, as appropriate, be transmitted to the chair of the RRT. Copies can then be forwarded to the NRT, members of the RRT, and others as appropriate.
(3) The lead agency shall make available to the trustees of affected natural resources information and documentation that can assist the trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.
(b) For discharges of oil, documentation and cost recovery provisions are described in § 300.315.
(c) Response actions undertaken by the participating agencies shall be carried out under existing programs and authorities when available. Federal agencies are to make resources available, expend funds, or participate in response to discharges and releases under their existing authority. Interagency agreements may be signed when necessary to ensure that the federal resources will be available for a timely response to a discharge or release. The ultimate decision as to the appropriateness of expending funds rests with the agency that is held accountable for such expenditures. Further funding provisions for discharges of oil are described in § 300.335.
(d) The Administrator of EPA and the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) shall assure that the costs of health assessment or health effect studies conducted under the authority of CERCLA section 104(i) are documented in accordance with standard EPA procedures for cost recovery. Documentation shall include information on the nature of the hazardous substances addressed by the research, information concerning the locations where these substances have been found, and any available information on response actions taken concerning these substances at the location.
§ 300.165
OSC reports.
(a) As requested by the NRT or RRT, the OSC/RPM shall submit to the NRT or RRT a complete report on the removal operation and the actions taken. The RRT shall review the OSC report and send to the NRT a copy of the OSC report with its comments or recommendations within 30 days after the RRT has received the OSC report.
(b) The OSC report shall record the situation as it developed, the actions taken, the resources committed, and the problems encountered.
§ 300.170
Federal agency participation.
Federal agencies listed in § 300.175 have duties established by statute, executive order, or Presidential directive which may apply to federal response actions following, or in prevention of, the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Some of these agencies also have duties relating to the restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources injured or lost as a result of such discharge or release as described in subpart G of this part. The NRT, RRT, and Area Committee organizational structure, and the NCP, RCPs and ACPs, described in § 300.210, provide for agencies to coordinate with each other in carrying out these duties.
(a) Federal agencies may be called upon by an OSC/RPM during response planning and implementation to provide assistance in their respective areas of expertise, as described in § 300.175, consistent with the agencies' capabilities and authorities.
(b) In addition to their general responsibilities, federal agencies should:
(1) Make necessary information available to the Secretary of the NRT, RRTs, Area Committees, and OSCs/RPMs.
(2) Provide representatives to the NRT and RRTs and otherwise assist RRTs and OSCs, as necessary, in formulating RCPs and ACPs.
(3) Inform the NRT, RRTs, and Area Committees, consistent with national security considerations, of changes in the availability of resources that would affect the operations implemented under the NCP.
(c) All federal agencies are responsible for reporting releases of hazardous substances from facilities or vessels under their jurisdiction or control in accordance with section 103 of CERCLA.
(d) All federal agencies are encouraged to report releases of pollutants or contaminants and must report discharges of oil, as required in 40 CFR part 110, from facilities or vessels under their jurisdiction or control to the NRC.
§ 300.175
Federal agencies: additional responsibilities and assistance.
(a) During preparedness planning or in an actual response, various federal agencies may be called upon to provide assistance in their respective areas of expertise, as indicated in paragraph (b) of this section, consistent with agency legal authorities and capabilities.
(b) The federal agencies include:
(1) USCG, as provided in 14 U.S.C. 1-3, is an agency in DOT, except when operating as an agency in the United States Navy (USN) in time of war. The USCG provides the NRT vice chair, co-chairs for the standing RRTs, and predesignated OSCs for the coastal zone, as described in § 300.120(a)(1). The USCG maintains continuously manned facilities which can be used for command, control, and surveillance of oil discharges and hazardous substance releases occurring in the coastal zone. The USCG also offers expertise in domestic and international fields of port safety and security, maritime law enforcement, ship navigation and construction, and the manning, operation, and safety of vessels and marine facilities. The USCG may enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with the appropriate state in order to implement a response action.
(2) EPA chairs the NRT and co-chairs, with the USCG, the standing RRTs; provides predesignated OSCs for all inland areas for which an ACP is required under CWA section 311(j) and for discharges and releases occurring in the inland zone and RPMs for remedial actions except as otherwise provided; and generally provides the SSC for responses in the inland zone. EPA provides expertise on human health and ecological effects of oil discharges or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants; ecological and human health risk assessment methods; and environmental pollution control techniques. Access to EPA's scientific expertise can be facilitated through the EPA representative to the Research and Development Committee of the National Response Team; the EPA Office of Research and Development's Superfund Technical Liaisons or Regional Scientists located in EPA Regional offices; or through EPA's Office of Science Planning and Regulatory Evaluation. EPA also provides legal expertise on the interpretation of CERCLA and other environmental statutes. EPA may enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with the appropriate state in order to implement a response action.
(3) FEMA provides guidance, policy and program advice, and technical assistance in hazardous materials, chemical, and radiological emergency preparedness activities (including planning, training, and exercising). FEMA's primary point of contact for administering financial and technical assistance to state and local governments to support their efforts to develop and maintain an effective emergency management and response capability is the Preparedness, Training, and Exercises Directorate.
(4) DOD has responsibility to take all action necessary with respect to releases where either the release is on, or the sole source of the release is from, any facility or vessel under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD. In addition to those capabilities provided by SUPSALV, DOD may also, consistent with its operational requirements and upon request of the OSC, provide locally deployed USN oil spill equipment and provide assistance to other federal agencies on request. The following two branches of DOD have particularly relevant expertise:
(i) The United States Army Corps of Engineers has specialized equipment and personnel for maintaining navigation channels, for removing navigation obstructions, for accomplishing structural repairs, and for performing maintenance to hydropower electric generating equipment. The Corps can also provide design services, perform construction, and provide contract writing and contract administrative services for other federal agencies.
(ii) The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSALV) is the branch of service within DOD most knowledgeable and experienced in ship salvage, shipboard damage control, and diving. The USN has an extensive array of specialized equipment and personnel available for use in these areas as well as specialized containment, collection, and removal equipment specifically designed for salvage-related and open-sea pollution incidents.
(5) DOE generally provides designated OSCs/RPMs that are responsible for taking all response actions with respect to releases where either the release is on, or the sole source of the release is from, any facility or vessel under its jurisdiction, custody, or control, including vessels bareboat-chartered and operated. In addition, under the FRERP, DOE provides advice and assistance to other OSCs/RPMs for emergency actions essential for the control of immediate radiological hazards. Incidents that qualify for DOE radiological advice and assistance are those believed to involve source, by-product, or special nuclear material or other ionizing radiation sources, including radium, and other naturally occurring radionuclides, as well as particle accelerators. Assistance is available through direct contact with the appropriate DOE Radiological Assistance Program Regional Office.
(6) The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has scientific and technical capability to measure, evaluate, and monitor, either on the ground or by use of aircraft, situations where natural resources including soil, water, wildlife, and vegetation have been impacted by fire, insects and diseases, floods, hazardous substances, and other natural or man-caused emergencies. The USDA may be contacted through Forest Service emergency staff officers who are the designated members of the RRT. Agencies within USDA have relevant capabilities and expertise as follows:
(i) The Forest Service has responsibility for protection and management of national forests and national grasslands. The Forest Service has personnel, laboratory, and field capability to measure, evaluate, monitor, and control as needed, releases of pesticides and other hazardous substances on lands under its jurisdiction.
(ii) The Agriculture Research Service (ARS) administers an applied and developmental research program in animal and plant protection and production; the use and improvement of soil, water, and air; the processing, storage, and distribution of farm products; and human nutrition. The ARS has the capabilities to provide regulation of, and evaluation and training for, employees exposed to biological, chemical, radiological, and industrial hazards. In emergency situations, the ARS can identify, control, and abate pollution in the areas of air, soil, wastes, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances for ARS facilities.
(iii) The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has personnel in nearly every county in the nation who are knowledgeable in soil, agronomy, engineering, and biology. These personnel can help to predict the effects of pollutants on soil and their movements over and through soils. Technical specialists can assist in identifying potential hazardous waste sites and provide review and advice on plans for remedial measures.
(iv) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) can respond in an emergency to regulate movement of diseased or infected organisms to prevent the spread and contamination of nonaffected areas.
(v) The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility to prevent meat and poultry products contaminated with harmful substances from entering human food channels. In emergencies, the FSIS works with other federal and state agencies to establish acceptability for slaughter of exposed or potentially exposed animals and their products. In addition they are charged with managing the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Program for the USDA.
(7) DOC, through NOAA, provides scientific support for response and contingency planning in coastal and marine areas, including assessments of the hazards that may be involved, predictions of movement and dispersion of oil and hazardous substances through trajectory modeling, and information on the sensitivity of coastal environments to oil and hazardous substances and associated clean-up and mitigation methods; provides expertise on living marine resources and their habitats, including endangered species, marine mammals and National Marine Sanctuary ecosystems; provides information on actual and predicted meteorological, hydrological, ice, and oceanographic conditions for marine, coastal, and inland waters, and tide and circulation data for coastal and territorial waters and for the Great Lakes.
(8) HHS assists with the assessment, preservation, and protection of human health and helps ensure the availability of essential human services. HHS provides technical and nontechnical assistance in the form of advice, guidance, and resources to other federal agencies as well as state and local governments.
(i) The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health Service and is coordinated from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and various Public Health Service regional offices. Within the Public Health Service, the primary response to a hazardous materials emergency comes from Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Both ATSDR and CDC have a 24-hour emergency response capability wherein scientific and technical personnel are available to provide technical assistance to the lead federal agency and state and local response agencies on human health threat assessment and analysis, and exposure prevention and mitigation. Such assistance is used for situations requiring evacuation of affected areas, human exposure to hazardous materials, and technical advice on mitigation and prevention. CDC takes the lead during petroleum releases regulated under the CWA and OPA while ATSDR takes the lead during chemical releases under CERCLA. Both agencies are mutually supportive.
(ii) Other Public Health Service agencies involved in support during hazardous materials incidents either directly or through ATSDR/CDC include the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health.
(iii) Statutory authority for HHS/National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) involvement in hazardous materials accident prevention is non-regulatory in nature and focused on two primary areas for preventing community and worker exposure to hazardous materials releases: Worker safety training and basic research activities. Under section 126 of SARA, NIEHS is given statutory authority for supporting development of curricula and model training programs for waste workers and chemical emergency responders.
Under section 118(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation and Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) (49 U.S.C. 1802
et
seq.
), NIEHS also administers the Hazmat Employee Training Program to prepare curricula and training for hazardous materials transportation workers. In the basic research arena, NIEHS is authorized under section 311 of SARA to conduct a hazardous substance basic research and training program to evaluate toxic effects and assess human health risks from accidental releases of hazardous materials. Under Title IX, section 901(h) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, NIEHS also is authorized to conduct basic research on air pollutants, as well as train physicians in environmental health. Federal research and training in hazardous materials release prevention represents an important non-regulatory activity and supplements ongoing private sector programs.

(15) The General Services Administration (GSA) provides logistic and telecommunications support to federal agencies. During an emergency situation, GSA quickly responds to aid state and local governments as directed by other federal agencies. The type of support provided might include leasing and furnishing office space, setting up telecommunications and transportation services, and advisory assistance.
§ 300.180
State and local participation in response.
(a) Each state governor is requested to designate one state office/representative to represent the state on the appropriate RRT. The state's office/representative may participate fully in all activities of the appropriate RRT. Each state governor is also requested to designate a lead state agency that will direct state-lead response operations. This agency is responsible for designating the lead state response official for federal and/or state-lead response actions, and coordinating/communicating with any other state agencies, as appropriate. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as may be provided by state law or arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes wishing to participate should assign one person or office to represent the
tribal government on the appropriate RRT.
(b) Appropriate local and state officials (including Indian tribes) will participate as part of the response structure as provided in the ACP.
(c) In addition to meeting the requirements for local emergency plans under SARA section 303, state and local government agencies are encouraged to include contingency planning for responses, consistent with the NCP, RCP, and ACP in all emergency and disaster planning.
(d) For facilities not addressed under CERCLA or the CWA, states are encouraged to undertake response actions themselves or to use their authorities to compel potentially responsible parties to undertake response actions.
(e) States are encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements pursuant to sections 104 (c)(3) and (d) of CERCLA to enable them to undertake actions authorized under subpart E of the NCP. Requirements for entering into these agreements are included in subpart F of the NCP. A state agency that acts pursuant to such agreements is referred to as the lead agency. In the event there is no cooperative agreement, the lead agency can be designated in a SMOA or other agreement.
(f) Because state and local public safety organizations would normally be the first government representatives at the scene of a discharge or release, they are expected to initiate public safety measures that are necessary to protect public health and welfare and that are consistent with containment and cleanup requirements in the NCP, and are responsible for directing evacuations pursuant to existing state or local procedures.
§ 300.185
Nongovernmental participation.
(a) Industry groups, academic organizations, and others are encouraged to commit resources for response operations. Specific commitments should be listed in the RCP and ACP. Those entities required to develop tank vessel and facility response plans under CWA section 311(j) must be able to respond to a worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable, and shall commit sufficient resources to implement other aspects of those plans in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR part 254, 33 CFR parts 150, 154, and 155; 40 CFR parts 112 and 118; and 49 CFR parts 171 and 194.
(b) The technical and scientific information generated by the local community, along with information from federal, state, and local governments, should be used to assist the OSC/RPM in devising response strategies where effective standard techniques are unavailable. Such information and strategies will be incorporated into the ACP, as appropriate. The SSC may act as liaison between the OSC/RPM and such interested organizations.
(c) ACPs shall establish procedures to allow for well organized, worthwhile, and safe use of volunteers, including compliance with § 300.150 regarding worker health and safety. ACPs should provide for the direction of volunteers by the OSC/RPM or by other federal, state, or local officials knowledgeable in contingency operations and capable of providing leadership. ACPs also should identify specific areas in which volunteers can be used, such as beach surveillance, logistical support, and bird and wildlife treatment. Unless specifically requested by the OSC/RPM, volunteers generally should not be used for physical removal or remedial activities. If, in the judgment of the OSC/RPM, dangerous conditions exist, volunteers shall be restricted from on-scene operations.
(d) Nongovernmental participation must be in compliance with the requirements of subpart H of this part if any recovery of costs will be sought.

This subpart summarizes emergency preparedness activities relating to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants; describes the three levels of contingency planning under the national
response system; and cross-references state and local emergency preparedness activities under SARA Title III, also known as the “Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986” but referred to herein as “Title III.” Regulations implementing Title III are codified at 40 CFR subchapter J.
§ 300.205
Planning and coordination structure.
(a)
National.
As described in § 300.110, the NRT is responsible for national planning and coordination.
(b)
Regional.
As described in § 300.115, the RRTs are responsible for regional planning and coordination.
(c)
Area.
As required by section 311(j) of the CWA, under the direction of the federal OSC for its area, Area Committees comprising qualified personnel of federal, state, and local agencies shall be responsible for:
(1) Preparing an ACP for their areas (as described in § 300.210(c));
(2) Working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to enhance the contingency planning of those officials and to assure pre-planning of joint response efforts, including appropriate procedures for mechanical recovery, dispersal, shoreline cleanup, protection of sensitive environmental areas, and protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fisheries and wildlife; and
(3) Working with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to expedite decisions for the use of dispersants and other mitigating substances and devices.
(d)
State.
As provided by sections 301 and 303 of Title III, the SERC of each state, appointed by the Governor, is to designate emergency planning districts, appoint Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), supervise and coordinate their activities, and review local emergency response plans, which are described in § 300.215. The SERC also is to establish procedures for receiving and processing requests from the public for information generated by Title III reporting requirements and to designate an official to serve as coordinator for information.
(e)
Local.
As provided by sections 301 and 303 of Title III, emergency planning districts are designated by the SERC in order to facilitate the preparation and implementation of emergency plans. Each LEPC is to prepare a local emergency response plan for the emergency planning district and establish procedures for receiving and processing requests from the public for information generated by Title III reporting requirements. The LEPC is to appoint a chair and establish rules for the LEPC. The LEPC is to designate an official to serve as coordinator for information and designate in its plan a community emergency coordinator.
(f) As required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA, a tank vessel, as defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance.
(g) The relationship of these plans is described in Figure 4.
EC02AU92.004
§ 300.210
Federal contingency plans.
There are three levels of contingency plans under the national response system: The National Contingency Plan, RCPs, and ACPs. These plans are available for inspection at EPA regional offices or USCG district offices. Addresses and telephone numbers for these offices may be found in the United States Government Manual, issued annually, or in local telephone directories.
(a)
The National Contingency Plan.
The purpose and objectives, authority, and scope of the NCP are described in §§ 300.1 through 300.3.
(b)
Regional Contingency Plans.
The RRTs, working with the states, shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, Alaska, Oceania in the
Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, effective response by various federal agencies and other organizations to discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. RCPs shall, as appropriate, include information on all useful facilities and resources in the region, from government, commercial, academic, and other sources. To the greatest extent possible, RCPs shall follow the format of the NCP and be coordinated with state emergency response plans, ACPs, which are described in § 300.210(c), and Title III local emergency response plans, which are described in § 300.215. Such coordination should be accomplished by working with the SERCs in the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall contain lines of demarcation between the inland and coastal zones, as mutually agreed upon by USCG and EPA.
(c)
Area Contingency Plans.
(1) Under the direction of an OSC and subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in consultation with the appropriate RRTs, Coast Guard DRGs, the NSFCC, SSCs, LEPCs, and SERCs, shall develop an ACP for its designated area. This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge under § 300.324, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near the area.
(2) The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and compatible, to the greatest extent possible, with all appropriate response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially with Title III local emergency response plans.
(3) The ACP shall include the following:
(i) A description of the area covered by the plan, including the areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be damaged by a discharge;
(ii) A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a discharge;
(iii) A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment), dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge, and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include such equipment lists);
(iv) A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and
(v) A detailed description of how the plan is integrated into other ACPs and tank vessel, offshore facility, and onshore facility response plans approved by the President, and into operating procedures of the NSFCC.
(4)(i) In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of injury to, fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees shall incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the USFWS and NOAA and other interested natural resource management agencies and parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and their habitat, and shall include other areas considered sensitive environments in a separate section of the annex, based upon Area Committee recommendations. The annex will provide the necessary information and procedures to immediately and effectively respond to discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat and sensitive environments, including provisions for a response to a worst case discharge. Such information shall include the identification of appropriate agencies and
their responsibilities, procedures to notify these agencies following a discharge or threat of a discharge, protocols for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits and other necessary permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of annex-related activities with removal operations.
(ii) The annex shall:
(A) Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, significant, or otherwise designated protected areas.
(B) Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (e)(4)(iii).
(C) Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to: Disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent taking or disturbance of fish and wildlife or specimens by response personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.
(D) Provide for pre-approval of application of specific countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans must be consistent with paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section and subpart J requirements, and must have the concurrence of the natural resource trustees.
(E) Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the environment. Monitoring should include “set-aside” or “control” areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.
(F) Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no interference with other OSC removal operations.
(G) Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and provide for required fish
and wildlife handling and rehabilitation permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the capture, transport, rehabilitation, and release of wildlife exposed to or threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of wildlife.
(H) Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the minimum required OSHA and EPA training for volunteers, including those who assist with injured wildlife.
(I) Define the requirements for evaluating the compatibility between this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels, facilities, and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, and sensitive environments.
§ 300.211
OPA facility and vessel response plans.
This section describes and cross-references the regulations that implement section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. A tank vessel, as defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance. These response plans are required to be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans. These regulations are codified as follows:
(a) For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 155;
(b) For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 CFR part 254;
(c) For non-transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 40 CFR 112.20 and 40 CFR part 118;

# Subpart D—Operational Response Phases for Oil Removal

# Source:
59 FR 47444, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.300
Phase I—Discovery or notification.
(a) A discharge of oil may be discovered through:
(1) A report submitted by the person in charge of a vessel or facility, in accordance with statutory requirements;
(2) Deliberate search by patrols;
(3) Random or incidental observation by government agencies or the public; or
(4) Other sources.
(b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall, as soon as he or she has knowledge of any discharge from such vessel or facility in violation of section 311(b)(3) of the CWA, immediately notify the NRC. If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the USCG or EPA predesignated OSC for the geographic area where the discharge occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the nearest Coast Guard unit. In any event such person in charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.
(c) Any other person shall, as appropriate, notify the NRC of a discharge of oil.
(d) Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall promptly notify the OSC. The OSC shall ensure notification of the appropriate state agency of any state which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, affected by the discharge. The OSC shall then proceed with the following phases as outlined in the RCP and ACP.
§ 300.305
Phase II—Preliminary assessment and initiation of action.
(a) The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary assessment.
(b) The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:
(1) Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment;
(2) Assess the feasibility of removal; and
(3) To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible parties.
(c) Where practicable, the framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.
(d) Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.
(1) In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:
(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;
(ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge; and
(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
(2) If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must direct all response efforts, as provided in § 300.322(b) of this part. The
OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill response participants that the federal government will direct the response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a discharge.
(e) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources (
i.e.
, personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.
§ 300.310
Phase III—Containment, countermeasures, cleanup, and disposal.
(a) Defensive actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment. Actions may include but are not limited to: Analyzing water samples to determine the source and spread of the oil; controlling the source of discharge; measuring and sampling; source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of physical barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural resources and sensitive ecosystems; control of the water discharged from upstream impoundment; and the use of chemicals and other materials in accordance with subpart J of this part to restrain the spread of the oil and mitigate its effects. The ACP prepared under § 300.210(c) should be consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products listed on the NCP Product Schedule.
(b) As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents shall not be used.
(c) Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and Area Committee guidelines may identify the disposal options available during an oil spill response and may describe what disposal requirements are mandatory or may not be waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should address: the sampling, testing, and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the segregation, temporary storage, and stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal approvals and permits; and the routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled debris, and animal carcasses; and procedures for obtaining waivers,
exemptions, or authorizations associated with handling or transporting waste materials. The ACPs may identify a hierarchy of preferences for disposal alternatives, with recycling (reprocessing) being the most preferred, and other alternatives preferred based on priorities for health or the environment.
§ 300.315
Phase IV—Documentation and cost recovery.
(a) All OSLTF users need to collect and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the CWA. In general, documentation shall be sufficient to support full cost recovery for resources utilized and shall identify the source and circumstances of the incident, the responsible party or parties, and impacts and potential impacts to public health and welfare and the environment. Documentation procedures are contained in 33 CFR part 136.
(b) When appropriate, documentation shall also be collected for scientific understanding of the environment and for research and development of improved response methods and technology. Funding for these actions is restricted by section 6002 of the OPA.
(c) OSCs shall submit OSC reports to the NRT or RRT, only if requested, as provided by § 300.165.
(d) OSCs shall ensure the necessary collection and safeguarding of information, samples, and reports. Samples and information shall be gathered expeditiously during the response to ensure an accurate record of the impacts incurred. Documentation materials shall be made available to the trustees of affected natural resources. The OSC shall make available to trustees of the affected natural resources information and documentation in the OSC's possession that can assist the trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.
(e) Information and reports obtained by the EPA or USCG OSC shall be transmitted to the appropriate offices responsible for follow-up actions.
§ 300.317
National response priorities.
(a) Safety of human life must be given the top priority during every response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of response personnel.
(b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire, or explosion, so that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container (vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse impact to the environment.
(c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.
(d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional discharges.
(e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.
§ 300.320
General pattern of response.
(a) When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally should be taken in the following sequence:
(1) Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such as the threat posed to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the source of the discharge.
(2) Officially classify the size (
i.e.
, minor, medium, major) and type (
i.e.
, substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, worst
case discharge) of the discharge and determine the course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States may be further classified as a spill of national significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of the USCG. The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in §§ 300.322, 300.323, and 300.324.
(i) When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.
(ii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if appropriate.
(iii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that proper removal action is being taken.
(3) If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, determine whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out removal. Removal is being done properly when:
(i) The responsible party is applying the resources called for in its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and
(ii) The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible party resources with government resources, the spill response will not be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.
(4) Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.
(5) Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.
(b) Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable state law.
§ 300.322
Response to substantial threats to public health or welfare of the United States.
(a) As part of the investigation described in § 300.320, the OSC shall determine whether a discharge results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States). Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the character of the discharge, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of the United States. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other discharges, and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.
(b) If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. In directing the response in such cases, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:
(1) Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;
(2) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and
(3) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.
(c) In the case of a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall:
(1) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance described in § 300.145, including the use of the services of the NSFCC, as appropriate;
(2) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and
(3) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate, including, but not limited to, implementation of the ACP as required by section 311(j)(4) of the CWA or relevant tank vessel or facility response plan required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the request of the OSC.
§ 300.323
Spills of national significance.
(a) A discharge may be classified as a spill of national significance (SONS) by the Administrator of EPA for discharges occurring in the inland zone and the Commandant of the USCG for discharges occurring in the coastal zone.
(b) For a SONS in the inland zone, the EPA Administrator may name a senior Agency official to assist the OSC in communicating with affected parties and the public and coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).
(c) For a SONS in the coastal zone, the USCG Commandant may name a National Incident Commander (NIC) who will assume the role of the OSC in communicating with affected parties and the public, and coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).
§ 300.324
Response to worst case discharges.
(a) If the investigation by the OSC shows that a discharge is a worst case discharge as defined in the ACP, or there is a substantial threat of such a discharge, the OSC shall:
(1) Notify the NSFCC;
(2) Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case portion of an approved tank vessel or facility response plan required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA;
(3) Implement the worst case portion of the ACP required by section 311(j)(4) of the CWA; and
(4) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate.
(b) Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, to remove a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge.
§ 300.335
Funding.
(a) The OSLTF is available under certain circumstances to fund removal of oil performed under section 311 of the CWA. Those circumstances and the procedures for accessing the OSLTF are described in 33 CFR part 136. The responsible party is liable for costs of federal removal and damages in accordance with section 311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of the OPA, and other federal laws.
(b) Where the OSC requests assistance from a federal agency, that agency may be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of 33 CFR part 136. Specific interagency reimbursement agreements may be used when necessary to ensure that the federal resources will be available for a timely response to a discharge of oil.
(c) Procedures for funding the initiation of natural resource damage assessment are covered in 33 CFR part 136.
(d) Response actions other than removal, such as scientific investigations not in support of removal actions or law enforcement, shall be provided by the agency with legal responsibility for those specific actions.
(e) The funding of a response to a discharge from a federally owned, operated, or supervised facility or vessel is the responsibility of the owning, operating, or supervising agency if it is a responsible party.
(f) The following agencies have funds available for certain discharge removal actions:
(1) DOD has two specific sources of funds that may be applicable to an oil discharge under appropriate circumstances. This does not consider military resources that might be made available under specific conditions.
(i) Funds required for removal of a sunken vessel or similar obstruction of navigation are available to the Corps of Engineers through Civil Works Appropriations, Operations and Maintenance, General.
(ii) USN may conduct salvage operations contingent on defense operational commitments, when funded by the requesting agency. Such funding may be requested on a direct cite basis.
(2) Pursuant to Title I of the OPA, the state or states affected by a discharge of oil may act where necessary to remove such discharge. Pursuant to 33 CFR part 136 states may be reimbursed from the OSLTF for the reasonable costs incurred in such a removal.

# Subpart E—Hazardous Substance Response

# Source:
55 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1990, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.400
General.
(a) This subpart establishes methods and criteria for determining the appropriate extent of response authorized by CERCLA and CWA section 311(c):
(1) When there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment; or
(2) When there is a release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare of the United States.
(b)
Limitations on response.
Unless the lead agency determines that a release constitutes a public health or environmental emergency and no other person with the authority and capability to respond will do so in a timely manner, a removal or remedial action under section 104 of CERCLA shall not be undertaken in response to a release:
(1) Of a naturally occurring substance in its unaltered form, or altered solely through naturally occurring processes or phenomena, from a location where it is naturally found;
(2) From products that are part of the structure of, and result in exposure within, residential buildings or business or community structures; or
(3) Into public or private drinking water supplies due to deterioration of the system through ordinary use.
(c)
Fund-financed action.
In determining the need for and in planning or undertaking Fund-financed action, the lead agency shall, to the extent practicable:
(1) Engage in prompt response;
(2) Provide for state participation in response actions, as described in subpart F of this part;
(3) Conserve Fund monies by encouraging private party response;
(4) Be sensitive to local community concerns;
(5) Consider using treatment technologies;
(6) Involve the Regional Response Team (RRT) in both removal and remedial response actions at appropriate decision-making stages;
(7) Encourage the involvement and sharing of technology by industry and other experts; and
(8) Encourage the involvement of organizations to coordinate responsible party actions, foster site response, and provide technical advice to the public, federal and state governments, and industry.
(d)
Entry and access.
(1) For purposes of determining the need for response, or choosing or taking a response action, or otherwise enforcing the provisions of CERCLA, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or
political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), has the authority to enter any vessel, facility, establishment or other place, property, or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and conduct, complete, operate, and maintain any response actions authorized by CERCLA or these regulations.
(2)(i) Under the authorities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), may enter:
(A) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property where any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant may be or has been generated, stored, treated, disposed of, or transported from;
(B) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property from which, or to which, a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant has been, or may have been, released or where such release is or may be threatened;
(C) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property where entry is necessary to determine the need for response or the appropriate response or to effectuate a response action; or
(D) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place, property, or location adjacent to those vessels, facilities, establishments, places, or properties described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(ii) Once a determination has been made that there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), is authorized to enter all vessels, facilities, establishments, places, properties, or locations specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, at which the release is believed to be, and all other vessels, facilities, establishments, places, properties, or locations identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that are related to the response or are necessary to enter in responding to that release.
(3) The lead agency may designate as its representative solely for the purpose of access, among others, one or more potentially responsible parties, including representatives, employees, agents, and contractors of such parties. EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may exercise the authority contained in section 104(e) of CERCLA to obtain access for its designated representative. A potentially responsible party may only be designated as a representative of the lead agency where that potentially responsible party has agreed to conduct response activities pursuant to an administrative order or consent decree.
(4)(i) If consent is not granted under the authorities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or if consent is conditioned in any manner, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may issue an order pursuant to section 104(e)(5) of CERCLA directing compliance with the request for access made under § 300.400(d)(1). EPA or the appropriate federal agency may ask the Attorney General to commence a civil action to compel compliance with either a request for access or an order directing compliance.
(ii) EPA reserves the right to proceed, where appropriate, under applicable authority other than CERCLA section 104(e).
(iii) The administrative order may direct compliance with a request to enter or inspect any vessel, facility, establishment, place, property, or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(iv) Each order shall contain:
(A) A determination by EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, that it is reasonable to believe that there may be or has been a release or threat of a release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant and a statement of the facts upon which the determination is based;
(B) A description, in light of CERCLA response authorities, of the purpose and estimated scope and duration of the entry, including a description of the specific anticipated activities to be conducted pursuant to the order;
(C) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that an officer or employee of the agency that issued the order will be available to confer with respondent prior to effective date of the order; and
(D) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that a court may impose a penalty of up to $25,000 per day for unreasonable failure to comply with the order. The civil monetary penalty amount listed in this section may not reflect recent inflation adjustments EPA is required to make. The current maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts are located in § 19.4.
(v) Orders shall be served upon the person or responsible party who failed to consent prior to their effective date. Force shall not be used to compel compliance with an order.
(vi) Orders may not be issued for any criminal investigations.
(e)
Permit requirements.
(1) No federal, state, or local permits are required for on-site response actions conducted pursuant to CERCLA sections 104, 106, 120, 121, or 122. The term
on-site
means the areal extent of contamination and all suitable areas in very close proximity to the contamination necessary for implementation of the response action.
(2) Permits, if required, shall be obtained for all response activities conducted off-site.
(f)
Health assessments.
Health assessments shall be performed by ATSDR at facilities on or proposed to be listed on the NPL and may be performed at other releases or facilities in response to petitions made to ATSDR. Where available, these health assessments may be used by the lead agency to assist in determining whether response actions should be taken and/or to identify the need for additional studies to assist in the assessment of potential human health effects associated with releases or potential releases of hazardous substances.
(g)
Identification of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements.
(1) The lead and support agencies shall identify requirements applicable to the release or remedial action contemplated based upon an objective determination of whether the requirement specifically addresses a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site.
(2) If, based upon paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it is determined that a requirement is not applicable to a specific release, the requirement may still be relevant and appropriate to the circumstances of the release. In evaluating relevance and appropriateness, the factors in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section shall be examined, where pertinent, to determine whether a requirement addresses problems or situations sufficiently similar to the circumstances of the release or remedial action contemplated, and whether the requirement is well-suited to the site, and therefore is both relevant and appropriate. The pertinence of each of the following factors will depend, in part, on whether a requirement addresses a chemical, location, or action. The following comparisons shall be made, where pertinent, to determine relevance and appropriateness:
(i) The purpose of the requirement and the purpose of the CERCLA action;
(ii) The medium regulated or affected by the requirement and the medium contaminated or affected at the CERCLA site;
(iii) The substances regulated by the requirement and the substances found at the CERCLA site;
(iv) The actions or activities regulated by the requirement and the remedial action contemplated at the CERCLA site;
(v) Any variances, waivers, or exemptions of the requirement and their availability for the circumstances at the CERCLA site;
(vi) The type of place regulated and the type of place affected by the release or CERCLA action;
(vii) The type and size of structure or facility regulated and the type and size of structure or facility affected by the release or contemplated by the CERCLA action;
(viii) Any consideration of use or potential use of affected resources in the requirement and the use or potential use of the affected resource at the CERCLA site.
(3) In addition to applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements, the lead and support agencies may, as appropriate, identify other advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered for a particular release. The “to be considered” (TBC) category consists of advisories, criteria, or guidance that were developed by EPA, other federal agencies, or states that may be useful in developing CERCLA remedies.
(4) Only those state standards that are promulgated, are identified by the state in a timely manner, and are more stringent than federal requirements may be applicable or relevant and appropriate. For purposes of identification and notification of promulgated state standards, the term
promulgated
means that the standards are of general applicability and are legally enforceable.
(5) The lead agency and support agency shall identify their specific requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate for a particular site. These agencies shall notify each other, in a timely manner as described in § 300.515(d), of the requirements they have determined to be applicable or relevant and appropriate. When identifying a requirement as an ARAR, the lead agency and support agency shall include a citation to the statute or regulation from which the requirement is derived.
(6) Notification of ARARs shall be according to procedures and timeframes specified in § 300.515 (d)(2) and (h)(2).
(h)
Oversight.
The lead agency may provide oversight for actions taken by potentially responsible parties to ensure that a response is conducted consistent with this part. The lead agency may also monitor the actions of third parties preauthorized under subpart H of this part. EPA will provide oversight when the response is pursuant to an EPA order or federal consent decree.
(i)
Other.
(1) This subpart does not establish any preconditions to enforcement action by either the federal or state governments to compel response actions by potentially responsible parties.
(2) While much of this subpart is oriented toward federally funded response actions, this subpart may be used as guidance concerning methods and criteria for response actions by other parties under other funding mechanisms. Except as provided in subpart H of this part, nothing in this part is intended to limit the rights of any person to seek recovery of response costs from responsible parties pursuant to CERCLA section 107.
(3) Activities by the federal and state governments in implementing this subpart are discretionary governmental functions. This subpart does not create in any private party a right to federal response or enforcement action. This subpart does not create any duty of the federal government to take any response action at any particular time.
[55 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 47447, Sept. 15, 1994; 89 FR 88656, Nov. 8, 2024]
§ 300.405
Discovery or notification.
(a) A release may be discovered through:
(1) A report submitted in accordance with section 103(a) of CERCLA,
i.e.
, reportable quantities codified at 40 CFR part 302;
(2) A report submitted to EPA in accordance with section 103(c) of CERCLA;
(3) Investigation by government authorities conducted in accordance with section 104(e) of CERCLA or other statutory authority;
(4) Notification of a release by a federal or state permit holder when required by its permit;
(5) Inventory or survey efforts or random or incidental observation reported by government agencies or the public;
(6) Submission of a citizen petition to EPA or the appropriate federal facility requesting a preliminary assessment, in accordance with section 105(d) of CERCLA;
(7) A report submitted in accordance with section 311(b)(5) of the CWA; and
(8) Other sources.
(b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall report releases as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the National Response Center (NRC). If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) on-scene coordinator (OSC) for the geographic area where the release occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC
may also be contacted through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the nearest USCG unit. In any event, such person in charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.
(c) All other reports of releases described under paragraph (a) of this section, except releases reported under paragraphs (a)(2) and (6) of this section, shall, as appropriate, be made to the NRC.
(d) The NRC will generally need information that will help to characterize the release. This will include, but not be limited to: Location of the release; type(s) of material(s) released; an estimate of the quantity of material released; possible source of the release; and date and time of the release. Reporting under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not be delayed due to incomplete notification information.
(e) Upon receipt of a notification of a release, the NRC shall promptly notify the appropriate OSC. The OSC shall notify the Governor, or designee, of the state affected by the release.
(f)(1) When the OSC is notified of a release that may require response pursuant to § 300.415(b), a removal site evaluation shall, as appropriate, be promptly undertaken pursuant to § 300.410.
(2) When notification indicates that removal action pursuant to § 300.415(b) is not required, a remedial site evaluation shall, if appropriate, be undertaken by the lead agency pursuant to § 300.420, if one has not already been performed.
(3) If radioactive substances are present in a release, the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator should be notified for evaluation and assistance either directly or via the NRC, consistent with §§ 300.130(e) and 300.145(f).
(g) Release notification made to the NRC under this section does not relieve the owner/operator of a facility from any obligations to which it is subject under SARA Title III or state law. In particular, it does not relieve the owner/operator from the requirements of section 304 of SARA Title III and 40 CFR part 355 and § 300.215(f) of this part for notifying the community emergency coordinator for the appropriate local emergency planning committee of all affected areas and the state emergency response commission of any state affected that there has been a release. Federal agencies are not legally obligated to comply with the requirements of Title III of SARA.

§ 300.410
Removal site evaluation.
(a) A removal site evaluation includes a removal preliminary assessment and, if warranted, a removal site inspection.
(b) A removal site evaluation of a release identified for possible CERCLA response pursuant to § 300.415 shall, as appropriate, be undertaken by the lead agency as promptly as possible. The lead agency may perform a removal preliminary assessment in response to petitions submitted by a person who is, or may be, affected by a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant pursuant to § 300.420(b)(5).
(c)(1) The lead agency shall, as appropriate, base the removal preliminary assessment on readily available information. A removal preliminary assessment may include, but is not limited to:
(i) Identification of the source and nature of the release or threat of release;
(ii) Evaluation by ATSDR or by other sources, for example, state public health agencies, of the threat to public health;
(iii) Evaluation of the magnitude of the threat;
(iv) Evaluation of factors necessary to make the determination of whether a removal is necessary; and
(v) Determination of whether a nonfederal party is undertaking proper response.
(2) A removal preliminary assessment of releases from hazardous waste management facilities may include collection or review of data such as site management practices, information from generators, photographs, analysis of historical photographs, literature
searches, and personal interviews conducted, as appropriate.
(d) A removal site inspection may be performed if more information is needed. Such inspection may include a perimeter (
i.e.
, off-site) or on-site inspection, taking into consideration whether such inspection can be performed safely.
(e)(1) As part of the evaluation under this section, the OSC shall determine whether a release governed by CWA section 311(c)(1), as amended by OPA section 4201(a), has occurred.
(2) If such a release of a CWA hazardous substance has occurred, the OSC shall determine whether the release results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States. Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the release, the character of the release, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of the United States. Upon obtaining relevant elements of such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other releases, and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.
(f) A removal site evaluation shall be terminated when the OSC or lead agency determines:
(1) There is no release;
(2) The source is neither a vessel nor a facility as defined in § 300.5 of the NCP;
(3) The release involves neither a hazardous substance, nor a pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare of the United States;
(4) The release consists of a situation specified in § 300.400(b)(1) through (3) subject to limitations on response;
(5) The amount, quantity, or concentration released does not warrant federal response;
(6) A party responsible for the release, or any other person, is providing appropriate response, and on-scene monitoring by the government is not required; or
(7) The removal site evaluation is completed.
(g) The results of the removal site evaluation shall be documented.
(h) The OSC or lead agency shall ensure that natural resource trustees are promptly notified in order that they may initiate appropriate actions, including those identified in subpart G of this part. The OSC or lead agency shall coordinate all response activities with such affected trustees.
(i) If the removal site evaluation indicates that removal action under § 300.415 is not required, but that remedial action under § 300.430 may be necessary, the lead agency shall, as appropriate, initiate a remedial site evaluation pursuant to § 300.420.
[59 FR 47448, Sept. 15, 1994]
§ 300.411
Response to CWA hazardous substance worst case discharges.
(a) If the investigation by the OSC shows that a discharge is a worst case discharge as defined in the ACP, or there is a substantial threat of such a discharge, the OSC shall:
(1) Notify the NSFCC;
(2) Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case portion of an approved facility response plan required by CWA section 311(j)(5);
(3) Implement the worst case portion of the ACP required by CWA section 311(j)(4); and
(4) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate.
(b) Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, to respond to a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge.
[89 FR 21966, Mar. 28, 2024]
§ 300.415
Removal action.
(a)(1) In determining the appropriate extent of action to be taken in response to a given release, the lead agency shall first review the removal site evaluation, any information produced through a remedial site evaluation, if any has been done previously, and the current site conditions, to determine if removal action is appropriate.
(2) Where the responsible parties are known, an effort initially shall be made, to the extent practicable, to determine whether they can and will perform the necessary removal action promptly and properly.
(3) This section does not apply to removal actions taken pursuant to section 104(b) of CERCLA. The criteria for such actions are set forth in section 104(b) of CERCLA.
(b)(1) At any release, regardless of whether the site is included on the National Priorities List (NPL), where the lead agency makes the determination, based on the factors in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that there is a threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, the lead agency may take any appropriate removal action to abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, or eliminate the release or the threat of release.
(2) The following factors shall be considered in determining the appropriateness of a removal action pursuant to this section:
(i) Actual or potential exposure to nearby human populations, animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants;
(ii) Actual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies or sensitive ecosystems;
(iii) Hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk storage containers, that may pose a threat of release;
(iv) High levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate;
(v) Weather conditions that may cause hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants to migrate or be released;
(vi) Threat of fire or explosion;
(vii) The availability of other appropriate federal or state response mechanisms to respond to the release; and
(viii) Other situations or factors that may pose threats to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment.
(3) If the lead agency determines that a removal action is appropriate, actions shall, as appropriate, begin as soon as possible to abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, or eliminate the threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment. The lead agency shall, at the earliest possible time, also make any necessary determinations pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(4) Whenever a planning period of at least six months exists before on-site activities must be initiated, and the lead agency determines, based on a site evaluation, that a removal action is appropriate:
(i) The lead agency shall conduct an engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) or its equivalent. The EE/CA is an analysis of removal alternatives for a site.
(ii) If environmental samples are to be collected, the lead agency shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:
(A) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and location of samples and the type of analyses; and
(B) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in planning and documenting the removal action.
(5) CERCLA fund-financed removal actions, other than those authorized under section 104(b) of CERCLA, shall be terminated after $2 million has been obligated for the action or 12 months have elapsed from the date that removal activities begin on-site, unless the lead agency determines that:
(i) There is an immediate risk to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment; continued response actions are immediately required to prevent, limit, or mitigate an emergency; and such assistance will not otherwise be provided on a timely basis; or
(ii) Continued response action is otherwise appropriate and consistent with the remedial action to be taken.
(c)(1) In carrying out a response to a release of a CWA hazardous substance, as described in CWA section 311(c)(1), as amended by OPA section 4201(a), the OSC may:
(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a release, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a release, at any time;
(ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a release; and
(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing or threatening to release CWA hazardous substances, by whatever means are available.
(2) If the investigation by the OSC under § 300.410 shows that the release of a CWA hazardous substance results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the release or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a release, as appropriate. In directing the response, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:
(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of the release;
(ii) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the release; and
(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing, or threatening to release, by whatever means are available.
(3) In the case of a release of a CWA hazardous substance posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall:
(i) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance described in § 300.145, as appropriate;
(ii) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and
(iii) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate. When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the release to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public in accordance with § 300.155. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on-scene, at the request of the OSC.
(d) Removal actions shall, to the extent practicable, contribute to the efficient performance of any anticipated long-term remedial action with respect to the release concerned.
(e) The following removal actions are, as a general rule, appropriate in the types of situations shown; however, this list is not exhaustive and is not intended to prevent the lead agency from taking any other actions deemed necessary under CERCLA, CWA section 311, or other appropriate federal or state enforcement or response authorities, and the list does not create a duty on the lead agency to take action at any particular time:
(1) Fences, warning signs, or other security or site control precautions—where humans or animals have access to the release;
(2) Drainage controls, for example, run-off or run-on diversion—where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants off-site or to prevent precipitation or run-off from other sources, for example, flooding, from entering the release area from other areas;
(3) Stabilization of berms, dikes, or impoundments or drainage or closing of lagoons—where needed to maintain the integrity of the structures;
(4) Capping of contaminated soils or sludges—where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants into soil, ground or surface water, or air;
(5) Using chemicals and other materials to retard the spread of the release or to mitigate its effects—where the use of such chemicals will reduce the spread of the release;
(6) Excavation, consolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage or other areas—where such actions will reduce the spread of, or direct contact with, the contamination;
(7) Removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk containers that contain or may contain hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants—where it will reduce the likelihood of spillage; leakage; exposure to humans, animals, or food chain; or fire or explosion;
(8) Containment, treatment, disposal, or incineration of hazardous materials—where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or food chain exposure; or
(9) Provision of alternative water supply—where necessary immediately to reduce exposure to contaminated household water and continuing until such time as local authorities can satisfy the need for a permanent remedy.
(f) Where necessary to protect public health or welfare, the lead agency shall request that FEMA conduct a temporary relocation or that state/local officials conduct an evacuation.
(g) If the lead agency determines that the removal action will not fully address the threat posed by the release and the release may require remedial action, the lead agency shall ensure an orderly transition from removal to remedial response activities.
(h) CERCLA removal actions conducted by states under cooperative agreements, described in subpart F of this part, shall comply with all requirements of this section.
(i) Facilities operated by a state or political subdivision at the time of disposal require a state cost share of at least 50 percent of Fund-financed response costs if a Fund-financed remedial action is conducted.
(j) Fund-financed removal actions under CERCLA section 104 and removal actions pursuant to CERCLA section 106 shall, to the extent practicable considering the exigencies of the situation, attain applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws. Waivers described in § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C) may be used for removal actions. Other federal and state advisories, criteria, or guidance may, as appropriate, be considered in formulating the removal action (see § 300.400(g)(3)). In determining whether compliance with ARARs is practicable, the lead agency may consider appropriate factors, including:
(1) The urgency of the situation; and
(2) The scope of the removal action to be conducted.
(k) Removal actions pursuant to section 106 or 122 of CERCLA are not subject to the following requirements of this section:
(1) Section 300.415(a)(2) requirement to locate responsible parties and have them undertake the response;
(2) Section 300.415(b)(2)(vii) requirement to consider the availability of other appropriate federal or state response and enforcement mechanisms to respond to the release;
(3) Section 300.415(b)(5) requirement to terminate response after $2 million has been obligated or 12 months have elapsed from the date of the initial response; and
(4) Section 300.415(g) requirement to assure an orderly transition from removal to remedial action.
(l) To the extent practicable, provision for post-removal site control following a CERCLA Fund-financed removal action at both NPL and non-NPL sites is encouraged to be made prior to the initiation of the removal action. Such post-removal site control includes actions necessary to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the removal action after the completion of the on-site removal action or after the $2 million or 12-month statutory limits are reached for sites that do not meet the exemption criteria in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Post-removal site control may be conducted by:
(1) The affected state or political subdivision thereof or local units of government for any removal;
(2) Potentially responsible parties; or
(3) EPA's remedial program for some federal-lead Fund-financed responses at NPL sites.
(m) OSCs/RPMs conducting removal actions shall submit OSC reports to the RRT as required by § 300.165.
(n)
Community relations in removal actions.
(1) In the case of all CERCLA removal actions taken pursuant to § 300.415 or CERCLA enforcement actions to compel removal response, a spokesperson shall be designated by the lead agency. The spokesperson shall inform the community of actions taken, respond to inquiries, and provide information concerning the release. All news releases or statements made by participating agencies shall be coordinated with the OSC/RPM. The spokesperson shall notify, at a minimum, immediately affected citizens,
state and local officials, and, when appropriate, civil defense or emergency management agencies.
(2) For CERCLA actions where, based on the site evaluation, the lead agency determines that a removal is appropriate, and that less than six months exists before on-site removal activity must begin, the lead agency shall:
(i) Publish a notice of availability of the administrative record file established pursuant to § 300.820 in a major local newspaper of general circulation or use one or more other mechanisms to give adequate notice to a community within 60 days of initiation of on-site removal activity;
(ii) Provide a public comment period, as appropriate, of not less than 30 days from the time the administrative record file is made available for public inspection, pursuant to § 300.820(b)(2); and
(iii) Prepare a written response to significant comments pursuant to § 300.820(b)(3).
(3) For CERCLA removal actions where on-site action is expected to extend beyond 120 days from the initiation of on-site removal activities, the lead agency shall by the end of the 120-day period:
(i) Conduct interviews with local officials, community residents, public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as appropriate, to solicit their concerns, information needs, and how or when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund process;
(ii) Prepare a formal community relations plan (CRP) based on the community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake during the response; and
(iii) Establish at least one local information repository at or near the location of the response action. The information repository should contain items made available for public information. Further, an administrative record file established pursuant to subpart I for all removal actions shall be available for public inspection in at least one of the repositories. The lead agency shall inform the public of the establishment of the information repository and provide notice of availability of the administrative record file for public review. All items in the repository shall be available for public inspection and copying.
(4) Where, based on the site evaluation, the lead agency determines that a CERCLA removal action is appropriate and that a planning period of at least six months exists prior to initiation of the on-site removal activities, the lead agency shall at a minimum:
(i) Comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, prior to the completion of the EE/CA, or its equivalent, except that the information repository and the administrative record file will be established no later than when the EE/CA approval memorandum is signed;
(ii) Publish a notice of availability and brief description of the EE/CA in a major local newspaper of general circulation or use one or more other mechanisms to give adequate notice to a community pursuant to § 300.820;
(iii) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar days, for submission of written and oral comments after completion of the EE/CA pursuant to § 300.820(a). Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 15 days; and
(iv) Prepare a written response to significant comments pursuant to § 300.820(a).

§ 300.420
Remedial site evaluation.
(a)
General.
The purpose of this section is to describe the methods, procedures, and criteria the lead agency shall use to collect data, as required, and evaluate releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The evaluation may consist of two steps: a remedial preliminary assessment (PA) and a remedial site inspection (SI).
(b)
Remedial preliminary assessment.
(1) The lead agency shall perform a remedial PA on all sites entered into the SEMS remedial assessment active inventory as defined in § 300.5 to:
(i) Eliminate from further consideration those sites that pose no threat to public health or the environment;
(ii) Determine if there is any potential need for removal action;
(iii) Set priorities for site inspections; and
(iv) Gather existing data to facilitate later evaluation of the release pursuant to the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) if warranted.
(2) A remedial PA shall consist of a review of existing information about a release such as information on the pathways of exposure, exposure targets, and source and nature of release. A remedial PA shall also include an off-site reconnaissance as appropriate. A remedial PA may include an on-site reconnaissance where appropriate.
(3) If the remedial PA indicates that a removal action may be warranted, the lead agency shall initiate removal evaluation pursuant to § 300.410.
(4) In performing a remedial PA, the lead agency may complete the EPA Preliminary Assessment form, available from EPA regional offices, or its equivalent, and shall prepare a PA report, which shall include:
(i) A description of the release;
(ii) A description of the probable nature of the release; and
(iii) A recommendation on whether further action is warranted, which lead agency should conduct further action, and whether an SI or removal action or both should be undertaken.
(5) Any person may petition the lead federal agency (EPA or the appropriate federal agency in the case of a release or suspected release from a federal facility), to perform a PA of a release when such person is, or may be, affected by a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Such petitions shall be addressed to the EPA Regional Administrator for the region in which the release is located, except that petitions for PAs involving federal facilities should be addressed to the head of the appropriate federal agency.
(i) Petitions shall be signed by the petitioner and shall contain the following:
(A) The full name, address, and phone number of petitioner;
(B) A description, as precisely as possible, of the location of the release; and
(C) How the petitioner is or may be affected by the release.
(ii) Petitions should also contain the following information to the extent available:
(A) What type of substances were or may be released;
(B) The nature of activities that have occurred where the release is located; and
(C) Whether local and state authorities have been contacted about the release.
(iii) The lead federal agency shall complete a remedial or removal PA within one year of the date of receipt of a complete petition pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if one has not been performed previously, unless the lead federal agency determines that a PA is not appropriate. Where such a determination is made, the lead federal agency shall notify the petitioner and will provide a reason for the determination.
(iv) When determining if performance of a PA is appropriate, the lead federal agency shall take into consideration:
(A) Whether there is information indicating that a release has occurred or there is a threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant; and
(B) Whether the release is eligible for response under CERCLA.
(c)
Remedial site inspection.
(1) The lead agency shall perform a remedial SI as appropriate to:
(i) Eliminate from further consideration those releases that pose no significant threat to public health or the environment;
(ii) Determine the potential need for removal action;
(iii) Collect or develop additional data, as appropriate, to evaluate the release pursuant to the HRS; and
(iv) Collect data in addition to that required to score the release pursuant to the HRS, as appropriate, to better characterize the release for more effective and rapid initiation of the RI/FS or response under other authorities.
(2) The remedial SI shall build upon the information collected in the remedial PA. The remedial SI shall involve, as appropriate, both on- and off-site field investigatory efforts, and sampling.
(3) If the remedial SI indicates that removal action may be appropriate, the
lead agency shall initiate removal site evaluation pursuant to § 300.410.
(4) Prior to conducting field sampling as part of site inspections, the lead agency shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:
(i) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and location of samples, and the type of analyses, and
(ii) The quality assurance project plan (QAPP), which describes policy, organization, and functional activities, and the data quality objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in site evaluation and hazard ranking system activities.
(5) Upon completion of a remedial SI, the lead agency shall prepare a report that includes the following:
(i) A description/history/nature of waste handling;
(ii) A description of known contaminants;
(iii) A description of pathways of migration of contaminants;
(iv) An identification and description of human and environmental targets; and
(v) A recommendation on whether further action is warranted.
[55 FR 8839, Mar. 8, 1990, as amended at 79 FR 65592, Nov. 5, 2014]
§ 300.425
Establishing remedial priorities.
(a)
General.
The purpose of this section is to identify the criteria as well as the methods and procedures EPA uses to establish its priorities for remedial actions.
(b)
National Priorities List.
The NPL is the list of priority releases for long-term remedial evaluation and response.
(1) Only those releases included on the NPL shall be considered eligible for Fund-financed remedial action. Removal actions (including remedial planning activities, RI/FSs, and other actions taken pursuant to CERCLA section 104(b)) are not limited to NPL sites.
(2) Inclusion of a release on the NPL does not imply that monies will be expended, nor does the rank of a release on the NPL establish the precise priorities for the allocation of Fund resources. EPA may also pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the release, including enforcement actions under CERCLA and other laws. A site's rank on the NPL serves, along with other factors, including enforcement actions, as a basis to guide the allocation of Fund resources among releases.
(3) Federal facilities that meet the criteria identified in paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for inclusion on the NPL. Except as provided by CERCLA sections 111(e)(3) and 111(c), federal facilities are not eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions.
(4) Inclusion on the NPL is not a precondition to action by the lead agency under CERCLA sections 106 or 122 or to action under CERCLA section 107 for recovery of non-Fund-financed costs or Fund-financed costs other than Fund-financed remedial construction costs.
(c)
Methods for determining eligibility for NPL.
A release may be included on the NPL if the release meets one of the following criteria:
(1) The release scores sufficiently high pursuant to the Hazard Ranking System described in appendix A to this part.
(2) A state (not including Indian tribes) has designated a release as its highest priority. States may make only one such designation; or
(3) The release satisfies all of the following criteria:
(i) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;
(ii) EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health; and
(iii) EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the release.
(d)
Procedures for placing sites on the NPL.
Lead agencies may submit candidates to EPA by scoring the release using the HRS and providing the appropriate backup documentation.
(1) Lead agencies may submit HRS scoring packages to EPA anytime throughout the year.
(2) EPA shall review lead agencies' HRS scoring packages and revise them as appropriate. EPA shall develop any additional HRS scoring packages on releases known to EPA.
(3) EPA shall compile the NPL based on the methods identified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) EPA shall update the NPL at least once a year.
(5) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to add a release to the NPL, EPA shall:
(i) Publish the proposed rule in the
Federal Register
and solicit comments through a public comment period; and
(ii) Publish the final rule in the
Federal Register,
and make available a response to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period.
(6) Releases may be categorized on the NPL when deemed appropriate by EPA.
(e)
Deletion from the NPL.
Releases may be deleted from or recategorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate.
(1) EPA shall consult with the state on proposed deletions from the NPL prior to developing the notice of intent to delete. In making a determination to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall consider, in consultation with the state, whether any of the following criteria has been met:
(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required;
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented, and no further response action by responsible parties is appropriate; or
(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.
(2) Releases shall not be deleted from the NPL until the state in which the release was located has concurred on the proposed deletion. EPA shall provide the state 30 working days for review of the deletion notice prior to its publication in the
Federal Register.
(3) All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for further Fund-financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. Whenever there is a significant release from a site deleted from the NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL without application of the HRS.
(4) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall:
(i) Publish a notice of intent to delete in the
Federal Register
and solicit comment through a public comment period of a minimum of 30 calendar days;
(ii) In a major local newspaper of general circulation at or near the release that is proposed for deletion, publish a notice of availability or use one or more other mechanisms to give adequate notice to a community of the intent to delete;
(iii) Place copies of information supporting the proposed deletion in the information repository, described in § 300.430(c)(2)(iii), at or near the release proposed for deletion. These items shall be available for public inspection and copying; and
(iv) Respond to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period and include this response document in the final deletion package.
(5) EPA shall place the final deletion package in the local information repository once the notice of final deletion has been published in the
Federal Register.

§ 300.430
Remedial investigation/feasibility study and selection of remedy.
(a)
General
—(1)
Introduction.
The purpose of the remedy selection process is to implement remedies that eliminate, reduce, or control risks to human health and the environment. Remedial actions are to be implemented as soon as site data and information make it possible to do so. Accordingly, EPA has established the following program goal, expectations, and program management principles to assist in the identification and implementation of appropriate remedial actions.
(i)
Program goal.
The national goal of the remedy selection process is to select remedies that are protective of human health and the environment, that maintain protection over time, and that minimize untreated waste.
(ii)
Program management principles.
EPA generally shall consider the following general principles of program management during the remedial process:
(A) Sites should generally be remediated in operable units when early actions are necessary or appropriate to achieve significant risk reduction quickly, when phased analysis and response is necessary or appropriate given the size or complexity of the site, or to expedite the completion of total site cleanup.
(B) Operable units, including interim action operable units, should not be inconsistent with nor preclude implementation of the expected final remedy.
(C) Site-specific data needs, the evaluation of alternatives, and the documentation of the selected remedy should reflect the scope and complexity of the site problems being addressed.
(iii)
Expectations.
EPA generally shall consider the following expectations in developing appropriate remedial alternatives:
(A) EPA expects to use treatment to address the principal threats posed by a site, wherever practicable. Principal threats for which treatment is most likely to be appropriate include liquids, areas contaminated with high concentrations of toxic compounds, and highly mobile materials.
(B) EPA expects to use engineering controls, such as containment, for waste that poses a relatively low long-term threat or where treatment is impracticable.
(C) EPA expects to use a combination of methods, as appropriate, to achieve protection of human health and the environment. In appropriate site situations, treatment of the principal threats posed by a site, with priority placed on treating waste that is liquid, highly toxic or highly mobile, will be combined with engineering controls (such as containment) and institutional controls, as appropriate, for treatment residuals and untreated waste.
(D) EPA expects to use institutional controls such as water use and deed restrictions to supplement engineering controls as appropriate for short- and long-term management to prevent or limit exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Institutional controls may be used during the conduct of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) and implementation of the remedial action and, where necessary, as a component of the completed remedy. The use of institutional controls shall not substitute for active response measures (e.g., treatment and/or containment of source material, restoration of ground waters to their beneficial uses) as the sole remedy unless such active measures are determined not to be practicable, based on the balancing of trade-offs among alternatives that is conducted during the selection of remedy.
(E) EPA expects to consider using innovative technology when such technology offers the potential for comparable or superior treatment performance or implementability, fewer or lesser adverse impacts than other available approaches, or lower costs for similar levels of performance than demonstrated technologies.
(F) EPA expects to return usable ground waters to their beneficial uses wherever practicable, within a timeframe that is reasonable given the particular circumstances of the site. When restoration of ground water to beneficial uses is not practicable, EPA expects to prevent further migration of the plume, prevent exposure to the contaminated ground water, and evaluate further risk reduction.
(2)
Remedial investigation/feasibility study.
The purpose of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the extent necessary to select a remedy. Developing and conducting an RI/FS generally includes the following activities: project scoping, data collection, risk assessment, treatability studies, and analysis of alternatives. The scope and timing of these activities should be tailored to
the nature and complexity of the problem and the response alternatives being considered.
(b)
Scoping.
In implementing this section, the lead agency should consider the program goal, program management principles, and expectations contained in this rule. The investigative and analytical studies should be tailored to site circumstances so that the scope and detail of the analysis is appropriate to the complexity of site problems being addressed. During scoping, the lead and support agencies shall confer to identify the optimal set and sequence of actions necessary to address site problems. Specifically, the lead agency shall:
(1) Assemble and evaluate existing data on the site, including the results of any removal actions, remedial preliminary assessment and site inspections, and the NPL listing process.
(2) Develop a conceptual understanding of the site based on the evaluation of existing data described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) Identify likely response scenarios and potentially applicable technologies and operable units that may address site problems.
(4) Undertake limited data collection efforts or studies where this information will assist in scoping the RI/FS or accelerate response actions, and begin to identify the need for treatability studies, as appropriate.
(5) Identify the type, quality, and quantity of the data that will be collected during the RI/FS to support decisions regarding remedial response activities.
(6) Prepare site-specific health and safety plans that shall specify, at a minimum, employee training and protective equipment, medical surveillance requirements, standard operating procedures, and a contingency plan that conforms with 29 CFR 1910.120 (l)(1) and (l)(2).
(7) If natural resources are or may be injured by the release, ensure that state and federal trustees of the affected natural resources have been notified in order that the trustees may initiate appropriate actions, including those identified in subpart G of this part. The lead agency shall seek to coordinate necessary assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with such state and federal trustees.
(8) Develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:
(i) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and location of samples and the type of analyses; and
(ii) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in selecting the appropriate remedy.
(9) Initiate the identification of potential federal and state ARARs and, as appropriate, other criteria, advisories, or guidance to be considered.
(c)
Community relations.
(1) The community relations requirements described in this section apply to all remedial activities undertaken pursuant to CERCLA section 104 and to section 106 or section 122 consent orders or decrees, or section 106 administrative orders.
(2) The lead agency shall provide for the conduct of the following community relations activities, to the extent practicable, prior to commencing field work for the remedial investigation:
(i) Conducting interviews with local officials, community residents, public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as appropriate, to solicit their concerns and information needs, and to learn how and when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund process.
(ii) Preparing a formal community relations plan (CRP), based on the community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake during the remedial response. The purpose of the CRP is to:
(A) Ensure the public appropriate opportunities for involvement in a wide
variety of site-related decisions, including site analysis and characterization, alternatives analysis, and selection of remedy;
(B) Determine, based on community interviews, appropriate activities to ensure such public involvement, and
(C) Provide appropriate opportunities for the community to learn about the site.
(iii) Establishing at least one local information repository at or near the location of the response action. Each information repository should contain a copy of items made available to the public, including information that describes the technical assistance grants application process. The lead agency shall inform interested parties of the establishment of the information repository.
(iv) Informing the community of the availability of technical assistance grants.
(3) For PRP actions, the lead agency shall plan and implement the community relations program at a site. PRPs may participate in aspects of the community relations program at the discretion of and with oversight by the lead agency.
(4) The lead agency may conduct technical discussions involving PRPs and the public. These technical discussions may be held separately from, but contemporaneously with, the negotiations/settlement discussions.
(5) In addition, the following provisions specifically apply to enforcement actions:
(i) Lead agencies entering into an enforcement agreement with de minimis parties under CERCLA section 122(g) or cost recovery settlements under section 122(h) shall publish a notice of the proposed agreement in the
Federal Register
at least 30 days before the agreement becomes final, as required by section 122(i). The notice must identify the name of the facility and the parties to the proposed agreement and must allow an opportunity for comment and consideration of comments; and
(ii) Where the enforcement agreement is embodied in a consent decree, public notice and opportunity for public comment shall be provided in accordance with 28 CFR 50.7.
(d)
Remedial investigation.
(1) The purpose of the remedial investigation (RI) is to collect data necessary to adequately characterize the site for the purpose of developing and evaluating effective remedial alternatives. To characterize the site, the lead agency shall, as appropriate, conduct field investigations, including treatability studies, and conduct a baseline risk assessment. The RI provides information to assess the risks to human health and the environment and to support the development, evaluation, and selection of appropriate response alternatives. Site characterization may be conducted in one or more phases to focus sampling efforts and increase the efficiency of the investigation. Because estimates of actual or potential exposures and associated impacts on human and environmental receptors may be refined throughout the phases of the RI as new information is obtained, site characterization activities should be fully integrated with the development and evaluation of alternatives in the feasibility study. Bench- or pilot-scale treatability studies shall be conducted, when appropriate and practicable, to provide additional data for the detailed analysis and to support engineering design of remedial alternatives.
(2) The lead agency shall characterize the nature of and threat posed by the hazardous substances and hazardous materials and gather data necessary to assess the extent to which the release poses a threat to human health or the environment or to support the analysis and design of potential response actions by conducting, as appropriate, field investigations to assess the following factors:
(i) Physical characteristics of the site, including important surface features, soils, geology, hydrogeology, meteorology, and ecology;
(ii) Characteristics or classifications of air, surface water, and ground water;
(iii) The general characteristics of the waste, including quantities, state, concentration, toxicity, propensity to bioaccumulate, persistence, and mobility;
(iv) The extent to which the source can be adequately identified and characterized;
(v) Actual and potential exposure pathways through environmental media;
(vi) Actual and potential exposure routes, for example, inhalation and ingestion; and
(vii) Other factors, such as sensitive populations, that pertain to the characterization of the site or support the analysis of potential remedial action alternatives.
(3) The lead and support agency shall identify their respective potential ARARs related to the location of and contaminants at the site in a timely manner. The lead and support agencies may also, as appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance in a timely manner (see § 300.400(g)(3)).
(4) Using the data developed under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the lead agency shall conduct a site-specific baseline risk assessment to characterize the current and potential threats to human health and the environment that may be posed by contaminants migrating to ground water or surface water, releasing to air, leaching through soil, remaining in the soil, and bioaccumulating in the food chain. The results of the baseline risk assessment will help establish acceptable exposure levels for use in developing remedial alternatives in the FS, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Feasibility study.
(1) The primary objective of the feasibility study (FS) is to ensure that appropriate remedial alternatives are developed and evaluated such that relevant information concerning the remedial action options can be presented to a decision-maker and an appropriate remedy selected. The lead agency may develop a feasibility study to address a specific site problem or the entire site. The development and evaluation of alternatives shall reflect the scope and complexity of the remedial action under consideration and the site problems being addressed. Development of alternatives shall be fully integrated with the site characterization activities of the remedial investigation described in paragraph (d) of this section. The lead agency shall include an alternatives screening step, when needed, to select a reasonable number of alternatives for detailed analysis.
(2) Alternatives shall be developed that protect human health and the environment by recycling waste or by eliminating, reducing, and/or controlling risks posed through each pathway by a site. The number and type of alternatives to be analyzed shall be determined at each site, taking into account the scope, characteristics, and complexity of the site problem that is being addressed. In developing and, as appropriate, screening the alternatives, the lead agency shall:
(i) Establish remedial action objectives specifying contaminants and media of concern, potential exposure pathways, and remediation goals. Initially, preliminary remediation goals are developed based on readily available information, such as chemical-specific ARARs or other reliable information. Preliminary remediation goals should be modified, as necessary, as more information becomes available during the RI/FS. Final remediation goals will be determined when the remedy is selected. Remediation goals shall establish acceptable exposure levels that are protective of human health and the environment and shall be developed by considering the following:
(A) Applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws, if available, and the following factors:
(
1
) For systemic toxicants, acceptable exposure levels shall represent concentration levels to which the human population, including sensitive subgroups, may be exposed without adverse effect during a lifetime or part of a lifetime, incorporating an adequate margin of safety;
(
2
) For known or suspected carcinogens, acceptable exposure levels are generally concentration levels that represent an excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to an individual of between 10
−4
and 10
−6
using information on the relationship between dose and response. The 10
−6
risk level shall be used as the point of departure for determining remediation goals for alternatives when ARARs are not available
or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposure;
(
3
) Factors related to technical limitations such as detection/quantification limits for contaminants;
(
4
) Factors related to uncertainty; and
(
5
) Other pertinent information.
(B) Maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs), established under the Safe Drinking Water Act, that are set at levels above zero, shall be attained by remedial actions for ground or surface waters that are current or potential sources of drinking water, where the MCLGs are relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release based on the factors in § 300.400(g)(2). If an MCLG is determined not to be relevant and appropriate, the corresponding maximum contaminant level (MCL) shall be attained where relevant and appropriate to the circumstances of the release.
(C) Where the MCLG for a contaminant has been set at a level of zero, the MCL promulgated for that contaminant under the Safe Drinking Water Act shall be attained by remedial actions for ground or surface waters that are current or potential sources of drinking water, where the MCL is relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release based on the factors in § 300.400(g)(2).
(D) In cases involving multiple contaminants or pathways where attainment of chemical-specific ARARs will result in cumulative risk in excess of 10
−4
, criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section may also be considered when determining the cleanup level to be attained.
(E) Water quality criteria established under sections 303 or 304 of the Clean Water Act shall be attained where relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release.
(F) An alternate concentration limit (ACL) may be established in accordance with CERCLA section 121(d)(2)(B)(ii).
(G) Environmental evaluations shall be performed to assess threats to the environment, especially sensitive habitats and critical habitats of species protected under the Endangered Species Act.
(ii) Identify and evaluate potentially suitable technologies, including innovative technologies;
(iii) Assemble suitable technologies into alternative remedial actions.
(3) For source control actions, the lead agency shall develop, as appropriate:
(i) A range of alternatives in which treatment that reduces the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants is a principal element. As appropriate, this range shall include an alternative that removes or destroys hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants to the maximum extent feasible, eliminating or minimizing, to the degree possible, the need for long-term management. The lead agency also shall develop, as appropriate, other alternatives which, at a minimum, treat the principal threats posed by the site but vary in the degree of treatment employed and the quantities and characteristics of the treatment residuals and untreated waste that must be managed; and
(ii) One or more alternatives that involve little or no treatment, but provide protection of human health and the environment primarily by preventing or controlling exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, through engineering controls, for example, containment, and, as necessary, institutional controls to protect human health and the environment and to assure continued effectiveness of the response action.
(4) For ground-water response actions, the lead agency shall develop a limited number of remedial alternatives that attain site-specific remediation levels within different restoration time periods utilizing one or more different technologies.
(5) The lead agency shall develop one or more innovative treatment technologies for further consideration if those technologies offer the potential for comparable or superior performance or implementability; fewer or lesser adverse impacts than other available approaches; or lower costs for similar levels of performance than demonstrated treatment technologies.
(6) The no-action alternative, which may be no further action if some removal or remedial action has already occurred at the site, shall be developed.
(7) As appropriate, and to the extent sufficient information is available, the short- and long-term aspects of the following three criteria shall be used to guide the development and screening of remedial alternatives:
(i)
Effectiveness.
This criterion focuses on the degree to which an alternative reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment, minimizes residual risks and affords long-term protection, complies with ARARs, minimizes short-term impacts, and how quickly it achieves protection. Alternatives providing significantly less effectiveness than other, more promising alternatives may be eliminated. Alternatives that do not provide adequate protection of human health and the environment shall be eliminated from further consideration.
(ii)
Implementability.
This criterion focuses on the technical feasibility and availability of the technologies each alternative would employ and the administrative feasibility of implementing the alternative. Alternatives that are technically or administratively infeasible or that would require equipment, specialists, or facilities that are not available within a reasonable period of time may be eliminated from further consideration.
(iii)
Cost.
The costs of construction and any long-term costs to operate and maintain the alternatives shall be considered. Costs that are grossly excessive compared to the overall effectiveness of alternatives may be considered as one of several factors used to eliminate alternatives. Alternatives providing effectiveness and implementability similar to that of another alternative by employing a similar method of treatment or engineering control, but at greater cost, may be eliminated.
(8) The lead agency shall notify the support agency of the alternatives that will be evaluated in detail to facilitate the identification of ARARs and, as appropriate, pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered.
(9)
Detailed analysis of alternatives.
(i) A detailed analysis shall be conducted on the limited number of alternatives that represent viable approaches to remedial action after evaluation in the screening stage. The lead and support agencies must identify their ARARs related to specific actions in a timely manner and no later than the early stages of the comparative analysis. The lead and support agencies may also, as appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance in a timely manner.
(ii) The detailed analysis consists of an assessment of individual alternatives against each of nine evaluation criteria and a comparative analysis that focuses upon the relative performance of each alternative against those criteria.
(iii)
Nine criteria for evaluation.
The analysis of alternatives under review shall reflect the scope and complexity of site problems and alternatives being evaluated and consider the relative significance of the factors within each criteria. The nine evaluation criteria are as follows:
(A)
Overall protection of human health and the environment.
Alternatives shall be assessed to determine whether they can adequately protect human health and the environment, in both the short- and long-term, from unacceptable risks posed by hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants present at the site by eliminating, reducing, or controlling exposures to levels established during development of remediation goals consistent with § 300.430(e)(2)(i). Overall protection of human health and the environment draws on the assessments of other evaluation criteria, especially long-term effectiveness and permanence, short-term effectiveness, and compliance with ARARs.
(B)
Compliance with ARARs.
The alternatives shall be assessed to determine whether they attain applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under federal environmental laws and state environmental or facility siting laws or provide grounds for invoking one of the waivers under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
(C)
Long-term effectiveness and permanence.
Alternatives shall be assessed for the long-term effectiveness and permanence they afford, along with the
degree of certainty that the alternative will prove successful. Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include the following:
(
1
) Magnitude of residual risk remaining from untreated waste or treatment residuals remaining at the conclusion of the remedial activities. The characteristics of the residuals should be considered to the degree that they remain hazardous, taking into account their volume, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate.
(
2
) Adequacy and reliability of controls such as containment systems and institutional controls that are necessary to manage treatment residuals and untreated waste. This factor addresses in particular the uncertainties associated with land disposal for providing long-term protection from residuals; the assessment of the potential need to replace technical components of the alternative, such as a cap, a slurry wall, or a treatment system; and the potential exposure pathways and risks posed should the remedial action need replacement.
(D)
Reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment.
The degree to which alternatives employ recycling or treatment that reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume shall be assessed, including how treatment is used to address the principal threats posed by the site. Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include the following:
(
1
) The treatment or recycling processes the alternatives employ and materials they will treat;
(
2
) The amount of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants that will be destroyed, treated, or recycled;
(
3
) The degree of expected reduction in toxicity, mobility, or volume of the waste due to treatment or recycling and the specification of which reduction(s) are occurring;
(
4
) The degree to which the treatment is irreversible;
(
5
) The type and quantity of residuals that will remain following treatment, considering the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances and their constituents; and
(
6
) The degree to which treatment reduces the inherent hazards posed by principal threats at the site.
(E)
Short-term effectiveness.
The short-term impacts of alternatives shall be assessed considering the following:
(
1
) Short-term risks that might be posed to the community during implementation of an alternative;
(
2
) Potential impacts on workers during remedial action and the effectiveness and reliability of protective measures;
(
3
) Potential environmental impacts of the remedial action and the effectiveness and reliability of mitigative measures during implementation; and
(
4
) Time until protection is achieved.
(F)
Implementability.
The ease or difficulty of implementing the alternatives shall be assessed by considering the following types of factors as appropriate:
(
1
) Technical feasibility, including technical difficulties and unknowns associated with the construction and operation of a technology, the reliability of the technology, ease of undertaking additional remedial actions, and the ability to monitor the effectiveness of the remedy.
(
2
) Administrative feasibility, including activities needed to coordinate with other offices and agencies and the ability and time required to obtain any necessary approvals and permits from other agencies (for off-site actions);
(
3
) Availability of services and materials, including the availability of adequate off-site treatment, storage capacity, and disposal capacity and services; the availability of necessary equipment and specialists, and provisions to ensure any necessary additional resources; the availability of services and materials; and availability of prospective technologies.
(G)
Cost.
The types of costs that shall be assessed include the following:
(
1
) Capital costs, including both direct and indirect costs;
(
2
) Annual operation and maintenance costs; and
(
3
) Net present value of capital and O
M costs.
(H)
State acceptance.
Assessment of state concerns may not be completed
until comments on the RI/FS are received but may be discussed, to the extent possible, in the proposed plan issued for public comment. The state concerns that shall be assessed include the following:
(
1
) The state's position and key concerns related to the preferred alternative and other alternatives; and
(
2
) State comments on ARARs or the proposed use of waivers.
(I)
Community acceptance.
This assessment includes determining which components of the alternatives interested persons in the community support, have reservations about, or oppose. This assessment may not be completed until comments on the proposed plan are received.
(f)
Selection of remedy
—(1) Remedies selected shall reflect the scope and purpose of the actions being undertaken and how the action relates to long-term, comprehensive response at the site.
(i) The criteria noted in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section are used to select a remedy. These criteria are categorized into three groups.
(A)
Threshold criteria.
Overall protection of human health and the environment and compliance with ARARs (unless a specific ARAR is waived) are threshold requirements that each alternative must meet in order to be eligible for selection.
(B)
Primary balancing criteria.
The five primary balancing criteria are long-term effectiveness and permanence; reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment; short-term effectiveness; implementability; and cost.
(C)
Modifying criteria.
State and community acceptance are modifying criteria that shall be considered in remedy selection.
(ii) The selection of a remedial action is a two-step process and shall proceed in accordance with § 300.515(e). First, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, identifies a preferred alternative and presents it to the public in a proposed plan, for review and comment. Second, the lead agency shall review the public comments and consult with the state (or support agency) in order to determine if the alternative remains the most appropriate remedial action for the site or site problem. The lead agency, as specified in § 300.515(e), makes the final remedy selection decision, which shall be documented in the ROD. Each remedial alternative selected as a Superfund remedy will employ the criteria as indicated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to make the following determination:
(A) Each remedial action selected shall be protective of human health and the environment.
(B) On-site remedial actions selected in a ROD must attain those ARARs that are identified at the time of ROD signature or provide grounds for invoking a waiver under § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C).
(
1
) Requirements that are promulgated or modified after ROD signature must be attained (or waived) only when determined to be applicable or relevant and appropriate and necessary to ensure that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment.
(
2
) Components of the remedy not described in the ROD must attain (or waive) requirements that are identified as applicable or relevant and appropriate at the time the amendment to the ROD or the explanation of significant difference describing the component is signed.
(C) An alternative that does not meet an ARAR under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws may be selected under the following circumstances:
(
1
) The alternative is an interim measure and will become part of a total remedial action that will attain the applicable or relevant and appropriate federal or state requirement;
(
2
) Compliance with the requirement will result in greater risk to human health and the environment than other alternatives;
(
3
) Compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engineering perspective;
(
4
) The alternative will attain a standard of performance that is equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement, or limitation through use of another method or approach;
(
5
) With respect to a state requirement, the state has not consistently applied, or demonstrated the intention
to consistently apply, the promulgated requirement in similar circumstances at other remedial actions within the state; or
(
6
) For Fund-financed response actions only, an alternative that attains the ARAR will not provide a balance between the need for protection of human health and the environment at the site and the availability of Fund monies to respond to other sites that may present a threat to human health and the environment.
(D) Each remedial action selected shall be cost-effective, provided that it first satisfies the threshold criteria set forth in § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B). Cost-effectiveness is determined by evaluating the following three of the five balancing criteria noted in § 300.430(f)(1)(i)(B) to determine overall effectiveness: long-term effectiveness and permanence, reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment, and short-term effectiveness. Overall effectiveness is then compared to cost to ensure that the remedy is cost-effective. A remedy shall be cost-effective if its costs are proportional to its overall effectiveness.
(E) Each remedial action shall utilize permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable. This requirement shall be fulfilled by selecting the alternative that satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section and provides the best balance of trade-offs among alternatives in terms of the five primary balancing criteria noted in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section. The balancing shall emphasize long-term effectiveness and reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment. The balancing shall also consider the preference for treatment as a principal element and the bias against off-site land disposal of untreated waste. In making the determination under this paragraph, the modifying criteria of state acceptance and community acceptance described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section shall also be considered.
(2)
The proposed plan.
In the first step in the remedy selection process, the lead agency shall identify the alternative that best meets the requirements in § 300.430(f)(1), above, and shall present that alternative to the public in a proposed plan. The lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency and consistent with § 300.515(e), shall prepare a proposed plan that briefly describes the remedial alternatives analyzed by the lead agency, proposes a preferred remedial action alternative, and summarizes the information relied upon to select the preferred alternative. The selection of remedy process for an operable unit may be initiated at any time during the remedial action process. The purpose of the proposed plan is to supplement the RI/FS and provide the public with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the preferred alternative for remedial action, as well as alternative plans under consideration, and to participate in the selection of remedial action at a site. At a minimum, the proposed plan shall:
(i) Provide a brief summary description of the remedial alternatives evaluated in the detailed analysis established under paragraph (e)(9) of this section;
(ii) Identify and provide a discussion of the rationale that supports the preferred alternative;
(iii) Provide a summary of any formal comments received from the support agency; and
(iv) Provide a summary explanation of any proposed waiver identified under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section from an ARAR.
(3)
Community relations to support the selection of remedy.
(i) The lead agency, after preparation of the proposed plan and review by the support agency, shall conduct the following activities:
(A) Publish a notice of availability and brief analysis of the proposed plan in a major local newspaper of general circulation;
(B) Make the proposed plan and supporting analysis and information available in the administrative record required under subpart I of this part;
(C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar days, for submission of written and oral comments on the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information located in the information repository, including the RI/FS. Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the
public comment period by a minimum of 30 additional days;
(D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during the public comment period at or near the site at issue regarding the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information;
(E) Keep a transcript of the public meeting held during the public comment period pursuant to CERCLA section 117(a) and make such transcript available to the public; and
(F) Prepare a written summary of significant comments, criticisms, and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period and the lead agency response to each issue. This responsiveness summary shall be made available with the record of decision.
(ii) After publication of the proposed plan and prior to adoption of the selected remedy in the record of decision, if new information is made available that significantly changes the basic features of the remedy with respect to scope, performance, or cost, such that the remedy significantly differs from the original proposal in the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information, the lead agency shall:
(A) Include a discussion in the record of decision of the significant changes and reasons for such changes, if the lead agency determines such changes could be reasonably anticipated by the public based on the alternatives and other information available in the proposed plan or the supporting analysis and information in the administrative record; or
(B) Seek additional public comment on a revised proposed plan, when the lead agency determines the change could not have been reasonably anticipated by the public based on the information available in the proposed plan or the supporting analysis and information in the administrative record. The lead agency shall, prior to adoption of the selected remedy in the ROD, issue a revised proposed plan, which shall include a discussion of the significant changes and the reasons for such changes, in accordance with the public participation requirements described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Final remedy selection.
(i) In the second and final step in the remedy selection process, the lead agency shall reassess its initial determination that the preferred alternative provides the best balance of trade-offs, now factoring in any new information or points of view expressed by the state (or support agency) and community during the public comment period. The lead agency shall consider state (or support agency) and community comments regarding the lead agency's evaluation of alternatives with respect to the other criteria. These comments may prompt the lead agency to modify aspects of the preferred alternative or decide that another alternative provides a more appropriate balance. The lead agency, as specified in § 300.515(e), shall make the final remedy selection decision and document that decision in the ROD.
(ii) If a remedial action is selected that results in hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants remaining at the site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, the lead agency shall review such action no less often than every five years after initiation of the selected remedial action.
(iii) The process for selection of a remedial action at a federal facility on the NPL, pursuant to CERCLA section 120, shall entail:
(A) Joint selection of remedial action by the head of the relevant department, agency, or instrumentality and EPA; or
(B) If mutual agreement on the remedy is not reached, selection of the remedy is made by EPA.
(5)
Documenting the decision.
(i) To support the selection of a remedial action, all facts, analyses of facts, and site-specific policy determinations considered in the course of carrying out activities in this section shall be documented, as appropriate, in a record of decision, in a level of detail appropriate to the site situation, for inclusion in the administrative record required under subpart I of this part. Documentation shall explain how the evaluation criteria in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section were used to select the remedy.
(ii) The ROD shall describe the following statutory requirements as they relate to the scope and objectives of the action:
(A) How the selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment, explaining how the remedy eliminates, reduces, or controls exposures to human and environmental receptors;
(B) The federal and state requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the site that the remedy will attain;
(C) The applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements of other federal and state laws that the remedy will not meet, the waiver invoked, and the justification for invoking the waiver;
(D) How the remedy is cost-effective,
i.e.
, explaining how the remedy provides overall effectiveness proportional to its costs;
(E) How the remedy utilizes permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable; and
(F) Whether the preference for remedies employing treatment which permanently and significantly reduces the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants as a principal element is or is not satisfied by the selected remedy. If this preference is not satisfied, the record of decision must explain why a remedial action involving such reductions in toxicity, mobility, or volume was not selected.
(iii) The ROD also shall:
(A) Indicate, as appropriate, the remediation goals, discussed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, that the remedy is expected to achieve. Performance shall be measured at appropriate locations in the ground water, surface water, soils, air, and other affected environmental media. Measurement relating to the performance of the treatment processes and the engineering controls may also be identified, as appropriate;
(B) Discuss significant changes and the response to comments described in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(F) of this section;
(C) Describe whether hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants will remain at the site such that a review of the remedial action under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section no less often than every five years shall be required; and
(D) When appropriate, provide a commitment for further analysis and selection of long-term response measures within an appropriate time-frame.
(6)
Community relations when the record of decision is signed.
After the ROD is signed, the lead agency shall:
(i) Publish a notice of the availability of the ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation; and
(ii) Make the record of decision available for public inspection and copying at or near the facility at issue prior to the commencement of any remedial action.
§ 300.435
Remedial design/remedial action, operation and maintenance.
(a)
General.
The remedial design/remedial action (RD/RA) stage includes the development of the actual design of the selected remedy and implementation of the remedy through construction. A period of operation and maintenance may follow the RA activities.
(b)
RD/RA activities.
(1) All RD/RA activities shall be in conformance with the remedy selected and set forth in the ROD or other decision document for that site. Those portions of RD/RA sampling and analysis plans describing the QA/QC requirements for chemical and analytical testing and sampling procedures of samples taken for the purpose of determining whether cleanup action levels specified in the ROD are achieved, generally will be consistent with the requirements of § 300.430(b)(8).
(2) During the course of the RD/RA, the lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that all federal and state requirements that are identified in the ROD as applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements for the action are met. If waivers from any ARARs are involved, the lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the conditions of the waivers are met.
(c)
Community relations.
(1) Prior to the initiation of RD, the lead agency shall review the CRP to determine whether it should be revised to describe further public involvement activities
during RD/RA that are not already addressed or provided for in the CRP.
(2) After the adoption of the ROD, if the remedial action or enforcement action taken, or the settlement or consent decree entered into, differs significantly from the remedy selected in the ROD with respect to scope, performance, or cost, the lead agency shall consult with the support agency, as appropriate, and shall either:
(i) Publish an explanation of significant differences when the differences in the remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or consent decree significantly change but do not fundamentally alter the remedy selected in the ROD with respect to scope, performance, or cost. To issue an explanation of significant differences, the lead agency shall:
(A) Make the explanation of significant differences and supporting information available to the public in the administrative record established under § 300.815 and the information repository; and
(B) Publish a notice that briefly summarizes the explanation of significant differences, including the reasons for such differences, in a major local newspaper of general circulation; or
(ii) Propose an amendment to the ROD if the differences in the remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or consent decree fundamentally alter the basic features of the selected remedy with respect to scope, performance, or cost. To amend the ROD, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, as provided in § 300.515(e), shall:
(A) Issue a notice of availability and brief description of the proposed amendment to the ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation;
(B) Make the proposed amendment to the ROD and information supporting the decision available for public comment;
(C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar days, for submission of written or oral comments on the amendment to the ROD. Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 30 additional days;
(D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during the public comment period at or near the facility at issue;
(E) Keep a transcript of comments received at the public meeting held during the public comment period;
(F) Include in the amended ROD a brief explanation of the amendment and the response to each of the significant comments, criticisms, and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period;
(G) Publish a notice of the availability of the amended ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation; and
(H) Make the amended ROD and supporting information available to the public in the administrative record and information repository prior to the commencement of the remedial action affected by the amendment.
(3) After the completion of the final engineering design, the lead agency shall issue a fact sheet and provide, as appropriate, a public briefing prior to the initiation of the remedial action.
(d)
Contractor conflict of interest.
(1) For Fund-financed RD/RA and O
M activities, the lead agency shall:
(i) Include appropriate language in the solicitation requiring potential prime contractors to submit information on their status, as well as the status of their subcontractors, parent companies, and affiliates, as potentially responsible parties at the site.
(ii) Require potential prime contractors to certify that, to the best of their knowledge, they and their potential subcontractors, parent companies, and affiliates have disclosed all information described in § 300.435(d)(1)(i) or that no such information exists, and that any such information discovered after submission of their bid or proposal or contract award will be disclosed immediately.
(2) Prior to contract award, the lead agency shall evaluate the information provided by the potential prime contractors and:
(i) Determine whether they have conflicts of interest that could significantly impact the performance of the contract or the liability of potential prime contractors or subcontractors.
(ii) If a potential prime contractor or subcontractor has a conflict of interest
that cannot be avoided or otherwise resolved, and using that potential prime contractor or subcontractor to conduct RD/RA or O
M work under a Fund-financed action would not be in the best interests of the state or federal government, an offeror or bidder contemplating use of that prime contractor or subcontractor may be declared nonresponsible or ineligible for award in accordance with appropriate acquisition regulations, and the contract may be awarded to the next eligible offeror or bidder.
(e)
Recontracting.
(1) If a Fund-financed contract must be terminated because additional work outside the scope of the contract is needed, EPA is authorized to take appropriate steps to continue interim RAs as necessary to reduce risks to public health and the environment. Appropriate steps may include extending an existing contract for a federal-lead RA or amending a cooperative agreement for a state-lead RA. Until the lead agency can reopen the bidding process and recontract to complete the RA, EPA may take such appropriate steps as described above to cover interim work to reduce such risks, where:
(i) Additional work is found to be needed as a result of such unforeseen situations as newly discovered sources, types, or quantities of hazardous substances at a facility; and
(ii) Performance of the complete RA requires the lead agency to rebid the contract because the existing contract does not encompass this newly discovered work.
(2) The cost of such interim actions shall not exceed $2 million.
(f)
Operation and maintenance.
(1) Operation and maintenance (O
M) measures are initiated after the remedy has achieved the remedial action objectives and remediation goals in the ROD, and is determined to be operational and functional, except for ground- or surface-water restoration actions covered under § 300.435(f)(4). A state must provide its assurance to assume responsibility for O
M, including, where appropriate, requirements for maintaining institutional controls, under § 300.510(c).
(2) A remedy becomes “operational and functional” either one year after construction is complete, or when the remedy is determined concurrently by EPA and the state to be functioning properly and is performing as designed, whichever is earlier. EPA may grant extensions to the one-year period, as appropriate.
(3) For Fund-financed remedial actions involving treatment or other measures to restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level that assures protection of human health and the environment, the operation of such treatment or other measures for a period of up to 10 years after the remedy becomes operational and functional will be considered part of the remedial action. Activities required to maintain the effectiveness of such treatment or measures following the 10-year period, or after remedial action is complete, whichever is earlier, shall be considered O
M. For the purposes of federal funding provided under CERCLA section 104(c)(6), a restoration activity will be considered administratively “complete” when:
(i) Measures restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level that assures protection of human health and the environment;
(ii) Measures restore ground or surface water to such a point that reductions in contaminant concentrations are no longer significant; or
(iii) Ten years have elapsed, whichever is earliest.
(4) The following shall not be deemed to constitute treatment or other measures to restore contaminated ground or surface water under § 300.435(f)(3):
(i) Source control maintenance measures; and
(ii) Ground- or surface-water measures initiated for the primary purpose of providing a drinking-water supply, not for the purpose of restoring ground water.
§ 300.440
Procedures for planning and implementing off-site response actions.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) This section applies to any remedial or removal action involving the off-site transfer of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant as defined under CERCLA sections 101 (14) and (33) (“CERCLA waste”) that is conducted by EPA,
States, private parties, or other Federal agencies, that is Fund-financed and/or is taken pursuant to any CERCLA authority, including cleanups at Federal facilities under section 120 of CERCLA, and cleanups under section 311 of the Clean Water Act (except for cleanup of petroleum exempt under CERCLA). Applicability extends to those actions taken jointly under CERCLA and another authority.
(2) In cases of emergency removal actions under CERCLA, emergency actions taken during remedial actions, or response actions under section 311 of the Clean Water Act where the release poses an immediate and significant threat to human health and the environment, the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) may determine that it is necessary to transfer CERCLA waste off-site without following the requirements of this section.
(3) This section applies to CERCLA wastes from cleanup actions based on CERCLA decision documents signed or consent decrees lodged after October 17, 1986 (“post-SARA CERCLA wastes”) as well as those based on CERCLA decision documents signed and consent decrees lodged prior to October 17, 1986 (“pre-SARA CERCLA wastes”). Pre-SARA and post-SARA CERCLA wastes are subject to the same acceptability criteria in § 300.440(b)(1) and (2).
(4) EPA (usually the EPA Regional Office) will determine the acceptability under this section of any facility selected for the treatment, storage, or disposal of CERCLA waste. EPA will determine if there are relevant releases or relevant violations at a facility prior to the facility's initial receipt of CERCLA waste. A facility which has previously been evaluated and found acceptable under this rule (or the preceding policy) is acceptable until the EPA Regional Office notifies the facility otherwise pursuant to § 300.440(d).
(5) Off-site transfers of those laboratory samples and treatability study CERCLA wastes from CERCLA sites set out in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, are not subject to the requirements of this section. However, those CERCLA wastes may not be transferred back to the CERCLA site unless the Remedial Project Manager or OSC assures the proper management of the CERCLA waste samples or residues and gives permission to the laboratory or treatment facility for the samples and/or residues to be returned to the site.
(i) Samples of CERCLA wastes sent to a laboratory for characterization;
(ii) RCRA hazardous wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA site for treatability studies and that meet the requirements for an exemption for RCRA under 40 CFR 261.4(e); and
(iii) Non-RCRA wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA site for treatability studies and that are below the quantity threshold established at 40 CFR 261.4(e)(2).
(b)
Acceptability criteria
—(1)
Facility compliance.
(i) A facility will be deemed in compliance for the purpose of this rule if there are no relevant violations at or affecting the unit or units receiving CERCLA waste:
(A) For treatment to standards specified in 40 CFR part 268, subpart D, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment;
(B) For treatment to substantially reduce its mobility, toxicity or persistence in the absence of a defined treatment standard, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment; or
(C) For storage or ultimate disposal of CERCLA waste not treated to the previous criteria at the same facility.
(ii) Relevant violations include significant deviations from regulations, compliance order provisions, or permit conditions designed to: ensure that CERCLA waste is destined for and delivered to authorized facilities; prevent releases of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, or hazardous substances to the environment; ensure early detection of such releases; or compel corrective action for releases. Criminal violations which result in indictment are also relevant violations. In addition, violations of the following requirements may be considered relevant:
(A) Applicable subsections of sections 3004 and 3005 of RCRA or, where applicable, other Federal laws (such as the Toxic Substances Control Act and subtitle D of RCRA);
(B) Applicable sections of State environmental laws; and
(C) In addition, land disposal units at RCRA subtitle C facilities receiving RCRA hazardous waste from response actions authorized or funded under CERCLA must be in compliance with RCRA section 3004(o) minimum technology requirements. Exceptions may be made only if the unit has been granted a waiver from these requirements under 40 CFR 264.301.
(2)
Releases.
(i) Release is defined in § 300.5 of this part. Releases under this section do not include:
(A)
De minimis
releases;
(B) Releases permitted under Federal programs or under Federal programs delegated to the States (Federally permitted releases are defined in § 300.5), except to the extent that such releases are found to pose a threat to human health and the environment; or
(C) Releases to the air that do not exceed standards promulgated pursuant to RCRA section 3004(n), or absent such standards, or where such standards do not apply, releases to the air that do not present a threat to human health or the environment.
(ii) Releases from units at a facility designated for off-site transfer of CERCLA waste must be addressed as follows:
(A)
Receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities.
CERCLA wastes may be transferred to an off-site unit regulated under subtitle C of RCRA, including a facility regulated under the permit-by-rule provisions of 40 CFR 270.60 (a), (b) or (c), only if that unit is not releasing any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the ground water, surface water, soil or air.
(B)
Other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal facilities.
CERCLA wastes may not be transferred to any unit at a RCRA subtitle C land disposal facility where a non-receiving unit is releasing any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the ground water, surface water, soil, or air, unless that release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA or other applicable Federal or State authority. For purposes of this section, a RCRA “land disposal facility” is any RCRA facility at which a land disposal unit is located, regardless of whether a land disposal unit is the receiving unit.
(C)
Other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage, and permit-by-rule facilities.
CERCLA wastes may not be transferred to any unit at a RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage or permit-by-rule facility, where a release of any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance from non-receiving units poses a significant threat to public health or the environment, unless that release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA or other applicable Federal or State authority.
(D)
All other facilities.
CERCLA wastes should not be transferred to any unit at an other-than-RCRA subtitle C facility if the EPA Regional Office has information indicating that an environmentally significant release of hazardous substances has occurred at that facility, unless the release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under an applicable Federal or State authority.
(iii) Releases are considered to be “controlled” for the purpose of this section as provided in § 300.440 (f)(3)(iv) and (f)(3)(v). A release is not considered “controlled” for the purpose of this section during the pendency of administrative or judicial challenges to corrective action requirements, unless the facility has made the requisite showing under § 300.440(e).
(c)
Basis for determining acceptability.
(1) If a State finds that a facility within its jurisdiction is operating in non-compliance with state law requirements including the requirements of any Federal program for which the State has been authorized, EPA will determine, after consulting with the State as appropriate, if the violation is relevant under the rule and if so, issue an initial determination of unacceptability.
(2) If a State finds that releases are occurring at a facility regulated under State law or a Federal program for which the State is authorized, EPA will determine, after consulting with the State as appropriate, if the release is relevant under the rule and if so, issue an initial determination of unacceptability.
(3) EPA may also issue initial determinations of unacceptability based on its own findings. EPA can undertake any inspections, data collection and/or assessments necessary. EPA will then notify with the State about the results and issue a determination notice if a relevant violation or release is found.
(d)
Determination of unacceptability.
(1) Upon initial determination by the EPA Regional Office that a facility being considered for the off-site transfer of any CERCLA waste does not meet the criteria for acceptability stated in § 300.440(b), the EPA Region shall notify the owner/operator of such facility, and the responsible agency in the State in which the facility is located, of the unacceptability finding. The notice will be sent by certified and first-class mail, return receipt requested. The certified notice, if not acknowledged by the return receipt card, should be considered to have been received by the addressee if properly sent by regular mail to the last address known to the EPA Regional Office.
(2) The notice shall generally: state that based on available information from a RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA), inspection, or other data sources, the facility has been found not to meet the requirements of § 300.440; cite the specific acts, omissions, or conditions which form the basis of these findings; and inform the owner/operator of the procedural recourse available under this regulation.
(3) A facility which was previously evaluated and found acceptable under this rule (or the preceding policy) may continue to receive CERCLA waste for 60 calendar days after the date of issuance of the notice, unless otherwise determined in accordance with paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of this section.
(4) If the owner or operator of the facility in question submits a written request for an informal conference with the EPA Regional Office within 10 calendar days from the issuance of the notice, the EPA Regional Office shall provide the opportunity for such conference no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the notice, if possible, to discuss the basis for the underlying violation or release determination, and its relevance to the facility's acceptability to receive CERCLA cleanup wastes. State representatives may attend the informal conference, submit written comments prior to the informal conference, and/or request additional meetings with the EPA Region, relating to the unacceptability issue during the determination process. If no State representative is present, EPA shall notify the State of the outcome of the conference. An owner/operator may submit written comments by the 30th day after issuance of the notice, in addition to or instead of requesting an informal conference.
(5) If the owner or operator neither requests an informal conference nor submits written comments, the facility becomes unacceptable to receive CERCLA waste on the 60th day after the notice is issued (or on such other date designated under paragraph (d)(9) of this section). The facility will remain unacceptable until such time as the EPA Regional Office notifies the owner or operator otherwise.
(6) If an informal conference is held or written comments are received, the EPA Region shall decide whether or not the information provided is sufficient to show that the facility is operating in physical compliance with respect to the relevant violations cited in the initial notice of unacceptability, and that all relevant releases have been eliminated or controlled, as required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such that a determination of acceptability would be appropriate. EPA will notify the owner/operator in writing whether or not the information provided is sufficient to support a determination of acceptability. Unless EPA determines that information provided by the owner/operator and the State is sufficient to support a determination of acceptability, the facility becomes unacceptable on the 60th calendar day after issuance of the original notice of unacceptability (or other date established pursuant to paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of this section).
(7) Within 10 days of hearing from the EPA Regional Office after the informal conference or the submittal of written comments, the owner/operator or the State may request a reconsideration of the unacceptability determination by the EPA Regional Administrator (RA). Reconsideration may be by review of
the record, by conference, or by other means deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator; reconsideration does not automatically stay the determination beyond the 60-day period. The owner/operator will receive notice in writing of the decision of the RA.
(8) The EPA Regional Administrator may decide to extend the 60-day period if more time is required to review a submission. The facility owner/operator shall be notified in writing if the Regional Administrator extends the 60 days.
(9) The EPA Regional Office may decide that a facility's unacceptability is immediately effective (or effective in less than 60 days) in extraordinary situations such as, but not limited to, emergencies at the facility or egregious violations. The EPA Region shall notify the facility owner/operator of the date of unacceptability, and may modify timeframes for comments and other procedures accordingly.
(e)
Unacceptability during administrative and judicial challenges of corrective action decisions.
For a facility with releases that are subject to a corrective action permit, order, or decree, an administrative or judicial challenge to the corrective action (or a challenge to a permit modification calling for additional corrective action) shall not be considered to be part of a corrective action “program” controlling those releases and shall not act to stay a determination of unacceptability under this rule. However, such facility may remain acceptable to receive CERCLA waste during the pendency of the appeal or litigation if:
(1) It satisfies the EPA Regional Office that adequate interim corrective action measures will continue at the facility; or
(2) It demonstrates to the EPA Regional Office the absence of a need to take corrective action during the short-term, interim period.
Either demonstration may be made during the 60-day review period in the context of the informal conference and RA reconsideration.
(f)
Re-evaluating unacceptability.
If, after notification of unacceptability and the opportunity to confer as described in § 300.440(d), the facility remains unacceptable, the facility can regain acceptability. A facility found to be unacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes based on relevant violations or releases may regain acceptability if the following conditions are met:
(1)
Judgment on the merits.
The facility has prevailed on the merits in an administrative or judicial challenge to the finding of noncompliance or uncontrolled releases upon which the unacceptability determination was based.
(2)
Relevant violations.
The facility has demonstrated to the EPA Region its return to physical compliance for the relevant violations cited in the notice.
(3)
Releases.
The facility has demonstrated to the EPA Region that:
(i) All releases from receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities have been eliminated and prior contamination from such releases is controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA;
(ii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal facilities are controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA;
(iii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment and storage facilities do not pose a significant threat to human health or the environment, or are controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA.
(iv) A RCRA subtitle C corrective action program may be incorporated into a permit, order, or decree, including the following: a corrective action order under RCRA section 3008(h), section 7003 or section 3013, a RCRA permit under 40 CFR 264.100 or 264.101, or a permit under an equivalent authority in a State authorized for corrective action under RCRA section 3004(u). Releases will be deemed controlled upon issuance of the order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires completion of one or more of the following: a RCRA Facility Investigation, a RCRA Corrective Measures Study, and/or Corrective Measures Implementation. The release remains controlled as long as the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, and enters
into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional corrective action measures when necessary, except during periods of administrative or judicial challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration under § 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.
(v) Facilities with releases regulated under other applicable Federal laws, or State laws under a Federally-delegated program may regain acceptability under this section if the releases are deemed by the EPA Regional Office not to pose a threat to human health or the environment, or if the facility enters into an enforceable agreement under those laws to conduct corrective action activities to control releases. Releases will be deemed controlled upon the issuance of an order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires one or more of the following: a facility investigation, a corrective action study, and/or corrective measures implementation. The release remains controlled as long as the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, and enters into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional corrective measures when necessary, except during periods of administrative or judicial challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration under § 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.
(4) Prior to the issuance of a determination that a facility has returned to acceptability, the EPA Region shall notify the State in which the facility is located, and provide an opportunity for the State to discuss the facility's acceptability status with EPA.
(5) An unacceptable facility may be reconsidered for acceptability whenever the EPA Regional Office finds that the facility fulfills the criteria stated in § 300.440(b). Upon such a finding, the EPA Regional Office shall notify the facility and the State in writing.

# Subpart F—State Involvement in Hazardous Substance Response

# Source:
55 FR 8853, Mar. 8, 1990, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.500
General.
(a) EPA shall ensure meaningful and substantial state involvement in hazardous substance response as specified in this subpart. EPA shall provide an opportunity for state participation in removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response activities. EPA shall encourage states to enter into an EPA/state Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA) under § 300.505 to increase state involvement and strengthen the EPA/state partnership.
(b) EPA shall encourage states to participate in Fund-financed response in two ways. Pursuant to § 300.515(a), states may either assume the lead through a cooperative agreement for the response action or may be the support agency in EPA-lead remedial response. Section 300.515 sets forth requirements for state involvement in EPA-lead remedial and enforcement response and also addresses comparable requirements for EPA involvement in state-lead remedial and enforcement response. Section 300.520 specifies requirements for state involvement in EPA-lead enforcement negotiations. Section 300.525 specifies requirements for state involvement in removal actions. In addition to the requirements set forth in this subpart, 40 CFR part 35, subpart O, “Cooperative Agreements and Superfund State Contracts for Superfund Response Actions,” contains further requirements for state participation during response.
§ 300.505
EPA/State Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA).
(a) The SMOA may establish the nature and extent of EPA and state interaction during EPA-lead and state-lead response (Indian tribes meeting the requirements of § 300.515(b) may be treated as states for purposes of this section). EPA shall enter into SMOA discussions if requested by a state. The following may be addressed in a SMOA:
(1) The EPA/state or Indian tribe relationship for removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response, including a description of the roles and the responsibilities of each.
(2) The general requirements for EPA oversight. Oversight requirements may be more specifically defined in cooperative agreements.
(3) The general nature of lead and support agency interaction regarding the review of key documents and/or decision points in removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response. The requirements for EPA and state review of each other's key documents when each is serving as the support agency shall be equivalent to the extent practicable. Review times agreed to in the SMOA must also be documented in site-specific cooperative agreements or Superfund state contracts in order to be binding.
(4) Procedures for modification of the SMOA (e.g., if EPA and a state agree that the lead and support agency roles and responsibilities have changed, or if modifications are required to achieve desired goals).
(b) The SMOA and any modifications thereto shall be executed by the EPA Regional Administrator and the head of the state agency designated as lead agency for state implementation of CERCLA.
(c) Site-specific agreements entered into pursuant to section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA shall be developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 35, subpart O. The SMOA shall not supersede such agreements.
(d)(1) EPA and the state shall consult annually to determine priorities and make lead and support agency designations for removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response to be conducted during the next fiscal year and to discuss future priorities and long-term requirements for response. These consultations shall include the exchange of information on both Fund- and non-Fund-financed response activities. The SMOA may describe the timeframe and process for the EPA/state consultation.
(2) The following activities shall be discussed in the EPA/state consultations established in the SMOA, or otherwise initiated and documented in writing in the absence of a SMOA, on a site-specific basis with EPA and the state identifying the lead agency for each response action discussed:
(i) Pre-remedial response actions, including preliminary assessments and site inspections;
(ii) Hazard Ranking System scoring and NPL listing and deletion activities;
(iii) Remedial phase activities, including remedial investigation/feasibility study, identification of potential applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under federal and state environmental laws and, as appropriate, other advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs), proposed plan, ROD, remedial design, remedial action, and operation and maintenance;
(iv) Potentially responsible party (PRP) searches, notices to PRPs, response to information requests, PRP negotiations, oversight of PRPs, other enforcement actions pursuant to state law, and activities where the state provides support to EPA;
(v) Compilation and maintenance of the administrative record for selection of a response action as required by subpart I of this part;
(vi) Related site support activities;
(vii) State ability to share in the cost and timing of payments; and
(viii) General CERCLA implementation activities.
(3) If a state is designated as the lead agency for a non-Fund-financed action at an NPL site, the SMOA shall be supplemented by site-specific enforcement agreements between EPA and the state which specify schedules and EPA involvement.
(4) In the absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with the requirements in § 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of the requirements specified in § 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall comply with any unaddressed requirements in that section.
§ 300.510
State assurances.
(a) A Fund-financed remedial action undertaken pursuant to CERCLA section 104(a) cannot proceed unless a state provides its applicable required assurances. The assurances must be provided by the state prior to the initiation of remedial action pursuant to a Superfund state contract for EPA-lead (or political subdivision-lead) remedial action or pursuant to a cooperative agreement for a state-lead remedial action. The SMOA may not be used for this purpose. Federally recognized Indian tribes are not required to provide CERCLA section 104(c)(3) assurances
for Fund-financed response actions. Further requirements pertaining to state, political subdivision, and federally recognized Indian tribe involvement in CERCLA response are found in 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
(b)(1) The state is not required to share in the cost of state- or EPA-lead Fund-financed removal actions (including remedial planning activities associated with remedial actions) conducted pursuant to CERCLA section 104 unless the facility was operated by the state or a political subdivision thereof at the time of disposal of hazardous substances therein and a remedial action is ultimately undertaken at the site. Such remedial planning activities include, but are not limited to, remedial investigations (RIs), feasibility studies (FSs), and remedial design (RD). States shall be required to share 50 percent, or greater, in the cost of all Fund-financed response actions if the facility was publicly operated at the time of the disposal of hazardous substances. For other facilities, except federal facilities, the state shall be required to share 10 percent of the cost of the remedial action.
(2) CERCLA section 104(c)(5) provides that EPA shall grant a state credit for reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket, non-federal expenditures subject to the limitations specified in CERCLA section 104(c)(5). For a state to apply credit toward its cost share, it must enter into a cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract. The state must submit as soon as possible, but no later than at the time CERCLA section 104 assurances are provided for a remedial action, its accounting of eligible credit expenditures for EPA verification. Additional credit requirements are contained in 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
(3) Credit may be applied to a state's future cost share requirements at NPL sites for response expenditures or obligations incurred by the state or a political subdivision from January 1, 1978 to December 11, 1980, and for the remedial action expenditures incurred only by the state after October 17, 1986.
(4) Credit that exceeds the required cost share at the site for which the credit is granted may be transferred to another site to offset a state's required remedial action cost share.
(c)(1) Prior to a Fund-financed remedial action, the state must also provide its assurance in accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(3)(A) to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of implemented remedial actions for the expected life of such actions. In addition, when appropriate, as part of the O
M assurance, the state must assure that any institutional controls implemented as part of the remedial action at a site are in place, reliable, and will remain in place after the initiation of O
M. The state and EPA shall consult on a plan for operation and maintenance prior to the initiation of a remedial action.
(2) After a joint EPA/State inspection of the implemented Fund-financed remedial action under § 300.515(g), EPA may share, for any extension period established in § 300.435(f)(2), in the cost of the operation of the remedy to ensure that the remedy is operational and functional. In the case of restoration of ground or surface water, EPA shall share in the cost of the State's operation of ground- or surface-water restoration remedial actions as specified in § 300.435(f)(3).
(d) In accordance with CERCLA sections 104 (c)(3)(B) and 121(d)(3), if the remedial action requires off-site storage, destruction, treatment, or disposal, the state must provide its assurance before the remedial action begins on the availability of a hazardous waste disposal facility that is in compliance with CERCLA section 121(d)(3) and is acceptable to EPA.
(e)(1) In accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(9), EPA shall not provide any remedial action pursuant to CERCLA section 104 until the state in which the release occurs enters into a cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract with EPA providing assurances deemed adequate by EPA that the state will assure the availability of hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities which:
(i) Have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure disposition of all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be generated
within the state during the 20-year period following the date of such cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract and to be destroyed, treated, or disposed;
(ii) Are within the state, or outside the state in accordance with an interstate agreement or regional agreement or authority;
(iii) Are acceptable to EPA; and
(iv) Are in compliance with the requirements of Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
(2) This rule does not address whether or not Indian tribes are states for purposes of this paragraph (e).
(f) EPA may determine that an interest in real property must be acquired in order to conduct a response action. However, as provided in CERCLA section 104(j)(2), EPA may acquire an interest in real estate in order to conduct a remedial action only if the State in which the interest to be acquired is located provides assurances, through a contract, cooperative agreement or otherwise, that the State will accept transfer of the interest upon completion of the remedial action. For purposes of this paragraph, “completion of the remedial action” is the point at which operation and maintenance (O
M) measures would be initiated pursuant to § 300.435(f). The State may accept a transfer of interest at an earlier point in time if agreed upon in writing by the State and EPA. Indian tribe assurances are to be provided as set out at 40 CFR part 35, subpart O, § 35.6110(b)(2).
[55 FR 8853, Mar. 8, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 35854, July 14, 1994]
§ 300.515
Requirements for state involvement in remedial and enforcement response.
(a)
General.
(1) States are encouraged to undertake actions authorized under subpart E. Section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with a state, political subdivision, or a federally recognized Indian tribe to carry out Fund-financed response actions authorized under CERCLA, when EPA determines that the state, the political subdivision, or federally recognized Indian tribe has the capability to undertake such actions. EPA will use a cooperative agreement to transfer funds to those entities to undertake Fund-financed response activities. The requirements for states, political subdivisions, or Indian tribes to receive funds as a lead or support agency for response are addressed at 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
(2) For EPA-lead Fund-financed remedial planning activities, including, but not limited to, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, and remedial designs, the state agency acceptance of the support agency role during an EPA-lead response shall be documented in a letter, SMOA, or cooperative agreement. Superfund state contracts are unnecessary for this purpose.
(3) Cooperative agreements and Superfund state contracts are only appropriate for non-Fund-financed response actions if a state intends to seek credit for remedial action expenses under § 300.510.
(b)
Indian tribe involvement during response.
To be afforded substantially the same treatment as states under section 104 of CERCLA, the governing body of the Indian tribe must:
(1) Be federally recognized; and
(2) Have a tribal governing body that is currently performing governmental functions to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the affected population or to protect the environment within a defined geographic area; and
(3) Have jurisdiction over a site at which Fund-financed response, including pre-remedial activities, is contemplated.
(c)
State involvement in PA/SI and National Priorities List process.
EPA shall ensure state involvement in the listing and deletion process by providing states opportunities for review, consultation, or concurrence specified in this section.
(1) EPA shall consult with states as appropriate on the information to be used in developing HRS scores for releases.
(2) EPA shall, to the extent feasible, provide the state 30 working days to review releases which were scored by EPA and which will be considered for placement on the National Priorities List (NPL).
(3) EPA shall provide the state 30 working days to review and concur on
the Notice of Intent to Delete a release from the NPL. Section 300.425 describes the EPA/state consultation and concurrence process for deleting releases from the NPL.
(d)
State involvement in RI/FS process.
A key component of the EPA/state partnership shall be the communication of potential federal and state ARARs and, as appropriate, other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs).
(1) In accordance with §§ 300.400(g) and 300.430, the lead and support agencies shall identify their respective potential ARARs and communicate them to each other in a timely manner,
i.e.
, no later than the early stages of the comparative analysis described in § 300.430(e)(9), such that sufficient time is available for the lead agency to consider and incorporate all potential ARARs without inordinate delays and duplication of effort. The lead and support agencies may also identify TBCs and communicate them in a timely manner.
(2) When a state and EPA have entered into a SMOA, the SMOA may specify a consultation process which requires the lead agency to solicit potential ARARs at specified points in the remedial planning and remedy selection processes. At a minimum, the SMOA shall include the points specified in § 300.515(h)(2). The SMOA shall specify timeframes for support agency response to lead agency requests to ensure that potential ARARs are identified and communicated in a timely manner. Such timeframes must also be documented in site-specific agreements. The SMOA may also discuss identification and communication of TBCs.
(3) If EPA in its statement of a proposed plan intends to waive any state-identified ARARs, or does not agree with the state that a certain state standard is an ARAR, it shall formally notify the state when it submits the RI/FS report for state review or responds to the state's submission of the RI/FS report.
(4) EPA shall respond to state comments on waivers from or disagreements about state ARARs, as well as the preferred alternative when making the RI/FS report and proposed plan available for public comment.
(e)
State involvement in selection of remedy.
(1) Both EPA and the state shall be involved in preliminary discussions of the alternatives addressed in the FS prior to preparation of the proposed plan and ROD. At the conclusion of the RI/FS, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, shall develop a proposed plan. The support agency shall have an opportunity to comment on the plan. The lead agency shall publish a notice of availability of the RI/FS report and a brief analysis of the proposed plan pursuant to § 300.430(e) and (f). Included in the proposed plan shall be a statement that the lead and support agencies have reached agreement or, where this is not the case, a statement explaining the concerns of the support agency with the lead agency's proposed plan. The state may not publish a proposed plan that EPA has not approved. EPA may assume the lead from the state if agreement cannot be reached.
(2)(i) EPA and the state shall identify, at least annually, sites for which RODs will be prepared during the next fiscal year, in accordance with § 300.515(h)(1). For all EPA-lead sites, EPA shall prepare the ROD and provide the state an opportunity to concur with the recommended remedy. For Fund-financed state-lead sites, EPA and the state shall designate sites, in a site-specific agreement, for which the state shall prepare the ROD and seek EPA's concurrence and adoption of the remedy specified therein, and sites for which EPA shall prepare the ROD and seek the state's concurrence. EPA and the state may designate sites for which the state shall prepare the ROD for non-Fund-financed state-lead enforcement response actions (
i.e.
, actions taken under state law) at an NPL site. The state may seek EPA's concurrence in the remedy specified therein. Either EPA or the state may choose not to designate a site as state-lead.
(ii) State concurrence on a ROD is not a prerequisite to EPA's selecting a remedy,
i.e.
, signing a ROD, nor is EPA's concurrence a prerequisite to a state's selecting a remedy at a non-Fund-financed state-lead enforcement
site under state law. Unless EPA's Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response or Regional Administrator concurs in writing with a state-prepared ROD, EPA shall not be deemed to have approved the state decision. A state may not proceed with a Fund-financed response action unless EPA has first concurred in and adopted the ROD. Section 300.510(a) specifies limitations on EPA's proceeding with a remedial action without state assurances.
(iii) The lead agency shall provide the support agency with a copy of the signed ROD for remedial actions to be conducted pursuant to CERCLA.
(iv) On state-lead sites identified for EPA concurrence, the state generally shall be expected to maintain its lead agency status through the completion of the remedial action.
(f)
Enhancement of remedy.
(1) A state may ask EPA to make changes in or expansions of a remedial action selected under subpart E.
(i) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is necessary and appropriate to the EPA-selected remedial action, the remedy may be modified (consistent with § 300.435(c)(2)) and any additional costs paid as part of the remedial action.
(ii) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is not necessary to the selected remedial action, but would not conflict or be inconsistent with the EPA-selected remedy, EPA may agree to integrate the proposed change or expansion into the planned CERCLA remedial work if:
(A) The state agrees to fund the entire additional cost associated with the change or expansion; and
(B) The state agrees to assume the lead for supervising the state-funded component of the remedy or, if EPA determines that the state-funded component cannot be conducted as a separate phase or activity, for supervising the remedial design and construction of the entire remedy.
(2) Where a state does not concur in a remedial action secured by EPA under CERCLA section 106, and the state desires to have the remedial action conform to an ARAR that has been waived under § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C), a state may seek to have that remedial action so conform, in accordance with the procedures set out in CERCLA section 121(f)(2) .
(g)
State involvement in remedial design/remedial action.
The extent and nature of state involvement during remedial design and remedial action shall be specified in site-specific cooperative agreements or Superfund state contracts, consistent with 40 CFR part 35, subpart O. For Fund-financed remedial actions, the lead and support agencies shall conduct a joint inspection at the conclusion of construction of the remedial action to determine that the remedy has been constructed in accordance with the ROD and with the remedial design.
(h)
Requirements for state involvement in absence of SMOA.
In the absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with the requirements in § 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of the requirements specified in § 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall comply with any unaddressed requirements in that section.
(1)
Annual consultations.
EPA shall conduct consultations with states at least annually to establish priorities and identify and document in writing the lead for remedial and enforcement response for each NPL site within the state for the upcoming fiscal year. States shall be given the opportunity to participate in long-term planning efforts for remedial and enforcement response during these annual consultations.
(2)
Identification of ARARs and TBCs.
The lead and support agencies shall discuss potential ARARs during the scoping of the RI/FS. The lead agency shall request potential ARARs from the support agency no later than the time that the site characterization data are available. The support agency shall communicate in writing those potential ARARs to the lead agency within 30 working days of receipt of the lead agency request for these ARARs. The lead and support agencies may also discuss and communicate other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs). After the initial screening of alternatives has been completed but prior to initiation of the comparative analysis conducted during the detailed analysis phase of the FS,
the lead agency shall request that the support agency communicate any additional requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the alternatives contemplated within 30 working days of receipt of this request. The lead agency shall thereafter consult the support agency to ensure that identified ARARs and TBCs are updated as appropriate.
(3)
Support agency review of lead agency documents.
The lead agency shall provide the support agency an opportunity to review and comment on the RI/FS, proposed plan, ROD, and remedial design, and any proposed determinations on potential ARARs and TBCs. The support agency shall have a minimum of 10 working days and a maximum of 15 working days to provide comments to the lead agency on the RI/FS, ROD, ARAR/TBC determinations, and remedial design. The support agency shall have a minimum of five working days and a maximum of 10 working days to comment on the proposed plan.
(i)
Administrative record requirements.
The state, where it is the lead agency for a Fund-financed site, shall compile and maintain the administrative record for selection of a response action under subpart I of this part unless specified otherwise in the SMOA.
§ 300.520
State involvement in EPA-lead enforcement negotiations.
(a) EPA shall notify states of response action negotiations to be conducted by EPA with potentially responsible parties during each fiscal year.
(b) The state must notify EPA of such negotiations in which it intends to participate.
(c) The state is not foreclosed from signing a consent decree if it does not participate substantially in the negotiations.
§ 300.525
State involvement in removal actions.
(a) States may undertake Fund-financed removal actions pursuant to a cooperative agreement with EPA. State-lead removal actions taken pursuant to cooperative agreements must be conducted in accordance with § 300.415 on removal actions, and 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.
(b) States are not required under section 104(c)(3) of CERCLA to share in the cost of a Fund-financed removal action, unless the removal is conducted at an NPL site that was operated by a state or political subdivision at the time of disposal of hazardous substances therein and a Fund-financed remedial action is ultimately undertaken at the site. In this situation, states are required to share, 50 percent or greater, in the cost of all removal (including remedial planning) and remedial action costs at the time of the remedial action.
(c) States are encouraged to provide for post-removal site control as discussed in § 300.415(k) for all Fund-financed removal actions.
(d) States shall be responsible for identifying potential state ARARs for all Fund-financed removal actions and for providing such ARARs to EPA in a timely manner for all EPA-lead removal actions.
(e) EPA shall consult with a state on all removal actions to be conducted in that state.

# Subpart G—Trustees for Natural Resources

# Source:
59 FR 47450, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.600
Designation of federal trustees.
(a) The President is required to designate in the NCP those federal officials who are to act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources. Federal officials so designated will act pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, and section 1006 of the OPA. Natural resources means land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled (hereinafter referred to as “managed or controlled”) by the United States (including the resources of the exclusive economic zone).
(b) The following individuals shall be the designated trustee(s) for general
categories of natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems. They are authorized to act pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA when there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, as a result of a release of a hazardous substance or a discharge of oil. Notwithstanding the other designations in this section, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall act as trustees of those resources subject to their respective management or control.
(1)
Secretary of Commerce.
The Secretary of Commerce shall act as trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by DOC and for natural resources managed or controlled by other federal agencies and that are found in, under, or using waters navigable by deep draft vessels, tidally influenced waters, or waters of the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and the outer continental shelf. However, before the Secretary takes an action with respect to an affected resource under the management or control of another federal agency, he shall, whenever practicable, seek to obtain the concurrence of that other federal agency. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: marine fishery resources; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; and the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves.
(2)
Secretary of the Interior.
The Secretary of the Interior shall act as trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by the DOI. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: migratory birds; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; federally owned minerals; and certain federally managed water resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall also be trustee for those natural resources for which an Indian tribe would otherwise act as trustee in those cases where the United States acts on behalf of the Indian tribe.
(3)
Secretary for the land managing agency.
For natural resources located on, over, or under land administered by the United States, the trustee shall be the head of the department in which the land managing agency is found. The trustees for the principal federal land managing agencies are the Secretaries of DOI, USDA, DOD, and DOE.
(4)
Head of authorized agencies.
For natural resources located in the United States but not otherwise described in this section, the trustee shall be the head of the federal agency or agencies authorized to manage or control those resources.
(5)
Additional trustees for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.
The Administrator of EPA and the Secretary of Agriculture shall act as trustees in connection with injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.
[59 FR 47450, Sept. 15, 1994, as amended at 79 FR 36431, June 27, 2014]
§ 300.605
State trustees.
State trustees shall act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, within the boundary of a state or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such state. For the purposes of subpart G of this part, the definition of the term
state
does not include Indian tribes. The governor of a state is encouraged to designate a state lead trustee to coordinate all state trustee responsibilities with other trustee agencies and with response activities of the RRT and OSC. The state's lead trustee would designate a representative to serve as contact with the OSC. This individual should have ready access to appropriate state officials with environmental protection, emergency response, and natural resource responsibilities. The EPA Administrator or USCG Commandant or their designees may appoint the state lead trustee as a member of the Area Committee. Response strategies should be coordinated between the state and other trustees and the OSC for specific natural resource locations in an inland or coastal zone and should be included in the Fish
and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex of the ACP.
§ 300.610
Indian tribes.
The tribal chairmen (or heads of the governing bodies) of Indian tribes, as defined in § 300.5, or a person designated by the tribal officials, shall act on behalf of the Indian tribes as trustees for the natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such Indian tribe, or held in trust for the benefit of such Indian tribe, or belonging to a member of such Indian tribe, if such resources are subject to a trust restriction on alienation. When the tribal chairman or head of the tribal governing body designates another person as trustee, the tribal chairman or head of the tribal governing body shall notify the President of such designation. Such officials are authorized to act when there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems as a result of a release of a hazardous substance.
§ 300.612
Foreign trustees.
Pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, foreign trustees shall act on behalf of the head of a foreign government as trustees for natural resources belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such foreign government.
§ 300.615
Responsibilities of trustees.
(a) Where there are multiple trustees, because of coexisting or contiguous natural resources or concurrent jurisdictions, they should coordinate and cooperate in carrying out these responsibilities.
(b) Trustees are responsible for designating to the RRTs and the Area Committees, for inclusion in the RCP and the ACP, appropriate contacts to receive notifications from the OSCs/RPMs of discharges or releases.
(c)(1) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, trustees may, pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, or section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, take the following or other actions as appropriate:
(i) Conduct a preliminary survey of the area affected by the discharge or release to determine if trust resources under their jurisdiction are, or potentially may be, affected;
(ii) Cooperate with the OSC/RPM in coordinating assessments, investigations, and planning;
(iii) Carry out damage assessments; or
(iv) Devise and carry out a plan for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. In assessing damages to natural resources, the federal, state, and Indian tribe trustees have the option of following the procedures for natural resource damage assessments located at 43 CFR part 11.
(2) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, or the potential for such, resulting from a discharge of oil occurring after August 18, 1990, the trustees, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, are to take the following actions:
(i) In accordance with OPA section 1006(c), determine the need for assessment of natural resource damages, collect data necessary for a potential damage assessment, and, where appropriate, assess damages to natural resources under their trusteeship; and
(ii) As appropriate, and subject to the public participation requirements of OPA section 1006(c), develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent, of the natural resources under their trusteeship;
(3)(i) The trustees, consistent with procedures specified in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan Annex to the Area Contingency Plan, shall provide timely advice on recommended actions concerning trustee resources that are potentially affected by a discharge of oil. This may include providing assistance to the OSC in identifying/recommending pre-approved response techniques and in predesignating shoreline types and areas in ACPs.
(ii) The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that the OSC is informed of their activities regarding natural resource
damage assessment that may affect response operations in order to assure coordination and minimize any interference with such operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC.
(iii) When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of federal response resources (including but not limited to aircraft, vessels, and booms to contain and remove discharged oil) with the trustees, providing trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.
(d) The authority of federal trustees includes, but is not limited to the following actions:
(1) Requesting that the Attorney General seek compensation from the responsible parties for the damages assessed and for the costs of an assessment and of restoration planning; and
(2) Participating in negotiations between the United States and potentially responsible parties to obtain PRP-financed or PRP-conducted assessments and restorations for injured resources or protection for threatened resources and to agree to covenants not to sue, where appropriate.
(3) Requiring, in consultation with the lead agency, any person to comply with the requirements of CERCLA section 104(e) regarding information gathering and access.
(4) Initiating damage assessments, as provided in OPA section 6002.
(e) Actions which may be taken by any trustee pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
(1) Requesting that an authorized agency issue an administrative order or pursue injunctive relief against the parties responsible for the discharge or release; or
(2) Requesting that the lead agency remove, or arrange for the removal of, or provide for remedial action with respect to, any oil or hazardous substances from a contaminated medium pursuant to section 104 of CERCLA or section 311 of CWA.

Section 106(b) petition.
Subject to conditions specified in CERCLA section 106(b), any person who has complied with an order issued after October 16, 1986 pursuant to section 106(a) of CERCLA, may seek reimbursement for response costs incurred in complying with that order unless the person has waived that right.
(f)
Section 123 reimbursement to local governments.
Any general purpose unit of local government for a political subdivision that is affected by a release may receive reimbursement for the costs of temporary emergency measures necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment subject to the conditions set forth in 40 CFR part 310. Such reimbursement may not exceed $25,000 for a single response.
(g)
Release From Liability.
Implementation of response measures by potentially responsible parties or by any other person does not release those parties from liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA, except as provided in a settlement under section 122 of CERCLA or a federal court judgment.

# Subpart J—Use of Dispersants, and Other Chemical and Biological Agents

# Source:
59 FR 47453, Sept. 15, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.900
General.
(a) Section 311(d)(2)(G) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires EPA to prepare a schedule identifying dispersants, other chemicals, other spill mitigating devices and substances, if any, that may be used in carrying out the NCP; and the waters and quantities in which they may be used safely. This subpart establishes a schedule that includes the NCP Product Schedule identifying chemical and biological agents, the Sorbents Product List, and the authorization of use procedures that, when taken together, identify the waters and quantities in which such dispersants, other chemicals, or other spill mitigating devices and substances may be used safely.
(b) This subpart applies to the navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines, the waters of the contiguous zone, and the high seas beyond the contiguous zone in connection
with activities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, activities under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, or activities that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the United States, including resources under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.
(c) This subpart applies to the use of chemical and biological agents as defined in Subpart A of this part, or other substances that may be used to remove, control, or otherwise mitigate oil discharges.
(d) [Reserved]
[59 FR 47453, Sept. 15, 1994, as amended at 88 FR 38333, June 12, 2023]
§ 300.910
Authorization for agent use.
Use of chemical or biological agents in response to oil discharges must be authorized by the OSC in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(a)
Use of agents identified on the NCP Product Schedule or use of burning agents on oil discharges addressed by a preauthorization plan.
Area Committees and RRTs shall address, as part of their planning activities, whether preauthorization of the use of chemical and biological agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule or the use of burning agents on certain oil discharges is appropriate. Area Committees and RRTs shall, as appropriate, include applicable approved preauthorization plans in ACPs and RCPs. When a preauthorization plan is approved in advance for the use of certain agents under specified discharge situations, then the OSC may authorize the use of agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule, or the use of burning agents, for the purpose for which they were specifically listed without obtaining the incident-specific concurrences and without the natural resource trustees consultations described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1)
Preauthorization plan development.
For discharge situations identified where such agents may be used, the preauthorization plan must, at a minimum, specify limits for the quantities and the duration of use, and use parameters for water depth, distance to shoreline, and proximity to populated areas. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, preauthorization plans should document how regional factors are addressed including likely sources and types of oil that might be discharged, various potential discharge scenarios, the existence and location of environmentally sensitive resources or restricted areas that might be impacted by discharged oil, and logistical factors including inventory, storage locations and manufacturing capability of available agents, availability of equipment needed for agent use, availability of adequately trained operators, and means to monitor agent use in the environment. Preauthorization plans are to be developed by the Area Committees or the RRT in consultation with the Area Committee(s).
(2)
Preauthorization plan approval.
The EPA representative to the RRT, the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior natural resource trustees and, as appropriate the RRT representative from the state(s) with jurisdiction over waters and adjoining shorelines within the preauthorization plan area shall review and either approve, approve with modification, or disapprove the preauthorization plans. The Area Committees and RRTs shall address the withdrawal of approval from a preauthorization plan, and the RRT shall notify the NRT of the status of the preauthorization plan within 30 days from any such withdrawal.
(3)
Preauthorization plan reviews.
The RRT in consultation with the Area Committee(s) must review, and revise, as needed, approved preauthorization plans. These reviews must be conducted following a regular timeframe, established by the RRT and documented in the plan, to address changes that may impact the conditions under which the use of chemical and biological agents have been preauthorized. Reviews must also be conducted in any affected region, at a minimum, after a major discharge or after a Spill of National Significance (SONS) relevant to the preauthorization plan area; to address revisions of the NCP Product Schedule impacting chemical or biological agents that may be individually listed within a preauthorization plan;
and to reflect new listings of threatened and/or endangered species applicable to the preauthorization plan area. The EPA RRT representative, the Department of Commerce and Department of the Interior natural resource trustees, and the RRT representative from the state(s) with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies shall review and either approve, approve with modification, or disapprove any revisions to the preauthorization plans.
(b)
Use of agents identified on the NCP Product Schedule or use of burning agents on oil discharges not addressed by a preauthorization plan.
For discharge situations that are not addressed by a preauthorization plan developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OSC may authorize the use of chemical or biological agents identified on the NCP Product Schedule on an oil discharge, or the use of burning agents, for the specific purpose for which they were listed with the concurrence of the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the state(s) with jurisdiction over the waters and adjoining shorelines threatened by the release or discharge, and in consultation with the Department of Commerce and Department of the Interior natural resource trustees. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, the OSC must consider and document for their authorization request to the RRT, at a minimum, the parameters for the use of agents including the quantities requested to be authorized, the duration of use, the depth of water, the distance to shoreline and proximity to populated areas, and should consider and document factors such as environmentally sensitive resources or restricted areas that might be impacted, agent inventory and storage locations, agent manufacturing capability, availability of equipment needed for agent use, availability of adequately trained operators and appropriate means to monitor agent use in the environment.
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Temporary exception.
In circumstances to prevent or substantially reduce an imminent threat to human life that cannot be immediately addressed by other procedures or provisions of the NCP, the OSC may authorize the provisional use of any chemical or biological agent, whether it is identified or not on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the state(s) with jurisdiction over the waters and adjoining shorelines threatened by the release or discharge, and without consultation with the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior natural resource trustees. This exception shall not be used as a substitute for compliance with § 300.150 of this part, including the use of personal protective equipment, or when there is sufficient time to seek authorization in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. If an agent is authorized for use pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC shall notify as soon as possible the EPA RRT representative and as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the affected state(s) and the Department of Commerce and Department of the Interior natural resource trustees. The OSC shall document the circumstances and the reasons for use of the agent authorized pursuant to this paragraph. Agent use for individual circumstances under this exception shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section no later than 24 hours after initial application.
(e)
Prohibited agents or substances.
The OSC may not authorize the use of the following:
(1) Sinking agents, or any other chemical agent, biological agent, or any substance that is used to directly sink the oil to the bottom of a water body.
(2) [Reserved]
(f)
Storage and use of agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule.
(1) The OSC may authorize for use only products listed on the NCP Product Schedule that are documented and certified by the responsible party or its representative to have been stored under the conditions provided by the submitter under § 300.915(a)(6), and whose date of use does not exceed the expiration date listed on the container's label unless otherwise specified for expired products as provided in § 300.910(f)(2), at the time of the incident.
(2) The OSC may authorize for use products listed on the NCP Product Schedule that exceed their expiration date after the responsible party or its representative documents and certifies that the expired product has been stored under the conditions provided by the submitter under § 300.915(a)(6) and still meets the applicable efficacy and toxicity listing provisions under § 300.915, based on testing of representative samples within the previous 12 months.
(g)
Supplemental testing, monitoring, and information.
The RRT may require, for both planning and response, including authorization of use, supplemental toxicity and efficacy testing, or submission of available data and information that addresses site, area, and ecosystem-specific concerns relative to the use of any chemical or biological agent. The product manufacturer or responsible party shall provide, upon request of the RRT or OSC, additional monitoring or testing data and information to inform chemical or biological agent use decisions specific to a response.
(h)
Recovery of chemical agents and other substances from the environment.
The responsible party shall ensure that removal actions adequately contain, collect, store, and dispose of chemical agents and other substances that are to be recovered from the environment, unless otherwise directed by the OSC. Chemical agents and other substances to be recovered include solidifiers, surface washing agents, and sorbents. The OSC should, at a minimum, consider factors such as the safety of response personnel and harm to the environment in making determinations pursuant to this paragraph.
(i)

# 1.0 Introduction
The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is the principal mechanism the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to place sites on the National Priorities List (NPL). The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the potential for releases of uncontrolled hazardous substances to cause human health or environmental damage. The HRS provides a measure of relative rather than absolute risk. It is designed so that it can be consistently applied to a wide variety of sites.

# 1.1 Definitions
Acute toxicity:
Measure of toxicological responses that result from a single exposure to a substance or from multiple exposures within a short period of time (typically several days or less). Specific measures of acute toxicity used within the HRS include lethal dose
50
(LD
50
) and lethal concentration
50
(LC
50
), typically measured within a 24-hour to 96-hour period.
Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALACs):
EPA's advisory concentration limit for acute or chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC)/National Recommended Water Quality Criteria:
EPA's maximum acute (Criteria Maximum Concentration or CMC) or chronic (Criterion Continuous Concentration or CCC) toxicity concentrations for protection of aquatic life and its uses as established under section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
Bioconcentration factor (BCF):
Measure of the tendency for a substance to accumulate in the tissue of an aquatic organism. BCF is determined by the extent of partitioning of a substance, at equilibrium, between the tissue of an aquatic organism and water. As the ratio of concentration of a substance in the organism divided by the concentration in water, higher BCF values reflect a tendency
for substances to accumulate in the tissue of aquatic organisms. [unitless].
Biodegradation:
Chemical reaction of a substance induced by enzymatic activity of microorganisms.
CERCLA:
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (Pub. L. 96-510, as amended).
Channelized flow:
Natural geological or manmade features such as karst, fractures, lava tubes, and utility conduits (
e.g.,
sewer lines), which allow ground water and/or soil gas to move through the subsurface environment more easily.
Chronic toxicity:
Measure of toxicological responses that result from repeated exposure to a substance over an extended period of time (typically 3 months or longer). Such responses may persist beyond the exposure or may not appear until much later in time than the exposure. HRS measures of chronic toxicity include Reference Dose (RfD) and Reference Concentration (RfC) values.
Contract Laboratory Program (CLP):
Analytical program developed for CERCLA waste site samples to fill the need for legally defensible analytical results supported by a high level of quality assurance and documentation.
Contract-Required Detection Limit (CRDL):
Term equivalent to contract-required quantitation limit, but used primarily for inorganic substances.
Contract-Required Quantitation Limit (CRQL):
Substance-specific level that a CLP laboratory must be able to routinely and reliably detect in specific sample matrices. It is not the lowest detectable level achievable, but rather the level that a CLP laboratory should reasonably quantify. The CRQL may or may not be equal to the quantitation limit of a given substance in a given sample. For HRS purposes, the term CRQL refers to both the contract-required quantitation limit and the contract-required detection limit.
Crawl space:
The enclosed or semi-enclosed area between a regularly occupied structure's foundation (
e.g.,
pier and beam construction) and the ground surface. Crawl space samples are collected to determine the concentration of hazardous substances in the air beneath a regularly occupied structure.
Curie (Ci):
Measure used to quantify the amount of radioactivity. One curie equals 37 billion nuclear transformations per second, and one picocurie (pCi) equals 10
−12
Ci.
Decay product:
Isotope formed by the radioactive decay of some other isotope. This newly formed isotope possesses physical and chemical properties that are different from those of its parent isotope, and may also be radioactive.
Detection Limit (DL):
Lowest amount that can be distinguished from the normal random “noise” of an analytical instrument or method. For HRS purposes, the detection limit used is the method detection limit (MDL) or, for real-time field instruments, the detection limit of the instrument as used in the field.
Dilution weight:
Parameter in the HRS surface water migration pathway that reduces the point value assigned to targets as the flow or depth of the relevant surface water body increases. [unitless].
Distance weight:
Parameter in the HRS air migration pathway, ground water migration pathway, and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway that reduces the point value assigned to targets as their distance increases from the site.
[unitless].
Distribution coefficient (K
d
):
Measure of the extent of partitioning of a substance between geologic materials (for example, soil, sediment, rock) and water (also called partition coefficient). The distribution coefficient is used in the HRS in evaluating the mobility of a substance for the ground water migration pathway. [ml/g].
ED
10
(
10 percent effective dose):
Estimated dose associated with a 10 percent increase in response over control groups. For HRS purposes, the response considered is cancer. [milligrams toxicant per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg-day)].
Food and Drug Administration Action Level (FDAAL):
Under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, concentration of a poisonous or deleterious substance in human food or animal feed at or above which FDA will take legal action to remove adulterated products from the market. Only FDAALs established for fish and shellfish apply in the HRS.
Half-life:
Length of time required for an initial concentration of a substance to be halved as a result of loss through decay. The HRS considers five decay processes for assigning surface water persistence: Biodegradation, hydrolysis, photolysis, radioactive decay, and volatilization. The HRS considers two decay processes for assigning subsurface intrusion degradation: Biodegradation and hydrolysis.

# 2.0 Evaluations Common to Multiple Pathways
2.1
Overview.
The HRS site score (S) is the result of an evaluation of four pathways:
• Ground Water Migration (S
gw
).
• Surface Water Migration (S
sw
).
• Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion (S
sessi
).
• Air Migration (S
a
).
The ground water and air migration pathways use single threat evaluations, while the surface water migration and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathways use multiple threat evaluations. Three threats are evaluated for the surface water migration pathway: Drinking water, human food chain, and environmental. These threats are evaluated for two separate migration components—overland/flood migration and ground water to surface water migration. Two components are evaluated for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway: Soil exposure and subsurface intrusion. The soil exposure component evaluates two threats: Resident population and nearby population, and the subsurface intrusion component is a single threat evaluation.
The HRS is structured to provide a parallel evaluation for each of these pathways, components, and threats. This section focuses on these parallel evaluations, starting with the calculation of the HRS site score and the individual pathway scores.
2.1.1
Calculation of HRS site score.
Scores are first calculated for the individual pathways as specified in sections 2 through 7 and then are combined for the site using the following root-mean-square equation to determine the overall HRS site score, which ranges from 0 to 100:
ER09JA17.062
2.1.2
Calculation of pathway score.
Table 2-1, which is based on the air migration pathway, illustrates the basic parameters used to calculate a pathway score. As Table 2-1 shows, each pathway (component or threat) score is the product of three “factor categories”: Likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. (The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway uses likelihood of exposure rather than likelihood of release.) Each of the three factor categories contains a set of factors that are assigned numerical values and combined as specified in sections 2 through 7. The factor values are rounded to the nearest integer, except where otherwise noted.
2.1.3
Common evaluations.
Evaluations common to all four HRS pathways include:
• Characterizing sources.
—Identifying sources (and, for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, areas of observed contamination,
areas of observed exposure and/or areas of subsurface contamination [see sections 5.1.0 and 5.2.0]).
—Identifying hazardous substances associated with each source (or area of observed contamination, or observed exposure, or subsurface contamination).
—Identifying hazardous substances available to a pathway.

These evaluations are essentially identical for the three migration pathways (ground water, surface water, and air). However, the evaluations differ in certain respects for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.
Section 7 specifies modifications that apply to each pathway when evaluating sites containing radioactive substances.
Section 2 focuses on evaluations common at the pathway, component, and threat levels. Note that for the ground water and surface water migration pathways, separate scores are calculated for each aquifer (see section 3.0) and each watershed (see sections 4.1.1.3 and 4.2.1.5) when determining the pathway scores for a site. Although the evaluations in section 2 do not vary when different aquifers or watersheds are scored at a site, the specific factor values (for example, observed release, hazardous waste quantity, toxicity/mobility) that result from these
evaluations can vary by aquifer and by watershed at the site. This can occur through differences both in the specific sources and targets eligible to be evaluated for each aquifer and watershed and in whether observed releases can be established for each aquifer and watershed. Such differences in scoring at the aquifer and watershed level are addressed in sections 3 and 4, not section 2.
2.2
Characterize sources.
Source characterization includes identification of the following:
• Sources (and areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) at the site.
• Hazardous substances associated with these sources (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination).
• Pathways potentially threatened by these hazardous substances.
Table 2-2 presents a sample worksheet for source characterization.
2.2.1
Identify sources.
For the three migration pathways, identify the sources at the site that contain hazardous substances. Identify the migration pathway(s) to which each source applies. For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, identify areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, and/or areas of subsurface contamination at the site (see sections 5.1.0 and 5.2.0).

2.2.2
Identify hazardous substances associated with a source.
For each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated with that source when evaluating each pathway. In some instances, a hazardous substance can be documented as being present at a site (for example, by labels, manifests, oral or written statements), but the specific source(s) containing that hazardous substance cannot be documented. For the three migration pathways, in those instances when the specific source(s) cannot be documented for a hazardous substance, consider the hazardous substance to be present in each source at the site, except sources for which definitive information indicates that the hazardous substance was not or could not be present.
For an area of observed contamination in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area (see section 5.1.0) to be associated with that area when evaluating the pathway.
For an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination (see section 5.2.0) in the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, consider only those hazardous substances that:
• Meet the criteria for observed exposure, or
• Meet the criteria for observed release in an area of subsurface contamination and have a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10

2.2.3
Identify hazardous substances available to a pathway.
In evaluating each migration pathway, consider the following hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the pathway:
• Ground water migration.
—Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release (see section 2.3) to ground water.
—All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 3.1.2.1).
• Surface water migration—overland/flood component.
—Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water in the watershed being evaluated.
—All hazardous substances associated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed (see sections 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).
• Surface water migration—ground water to surface water component.
—Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water.
—All hazardous substances associated with a source with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 4.2.2.1.2 and 3.1.2.1).
• Air migration.
—Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.
—All gaseous hazardous substances associated with a source with a gas containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 6.1.2.1.1).
—All particulate hazardous substances associated with a source with a particulate containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 6.1.2.2.1).
• For each migration pathway, in those instances when the specific source(s) containing the hazardous substance cannot be documented, consider that hazardous substance to be available to migrate to the pathway when it can be associated (see section 2.2.2) with at least one source having a containment factor value greater than 0 for that pathway.
In evaluating the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, consider the following hazardous substances available to the pathway:
• Soil exposure component—resident population threat.
—All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination at the site (see section 5.1.0).
• Soil exposure component—nearby population threat.
—All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination at areas with an attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0 (see section 5.1.2.1.1).
• Subsurface intrusion component.
—All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed exposure at the site (see section 5.2.0).
—All hazardous substances with a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10

/mol that meet the criteria for an observed release in an area of subsurface contamination (see section 5.2.0).
—All hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release in a structure within, or in a sample from
below, an area of observed exposure (see section 5.2.0).
2.3
Likelihood of release.
Likelihood of release is a measure of the likelihood that a waste has been or will be released to the environment. The likelihood of release factor category is assigned the maximum value of 550 for a migration pathway whenever the criteria for an observed release are met for that pathway. If the criteria for an observed release are met, do not evaluate potential to release for that pathway. When the criteria for an observed release are not met, evaluate potential to release for that pathway, with a maximum value of 500. The evaluation of potential to release varies by migration pathway (see sections 3, 4 and 6).
Establish an observed release either by direct observation of the release of a hazardous substance into the media being evaluated (for example, surface water) or by chemical analysis of samples appropriate to the pathway being evaluated (see sections 3, 4 and 6). The minimum standard to establish an observed release by chemical analysis is analytical evidence of a hazardous substance in the media significantly above the background level. Further, some portion of the release must be attributable to the site. Use the criteria in Table 2-3 as the standard for determining analytical significance. (The criteria in Table 2-3 are also used in establishing observed contamination for the soil exposure component and for establishing areas of observed exposure and areas of subsurface contamination in the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, see section 5.1.0 and section 5.2.0). Separate criteria apply to radionuclides (see section 7.1.1).

An observed release is established as follows:
• If the background concentration is not detected (or is less than the detection limit), an observed release is established when the sample measurement equals or exceeds the sample quantitation limit.
a
• If the background concentration equals or exceeds the detection limit, an observed release is established when the sample measurement is 3 times or more above the background concentration.
a
If the sample quantitation limit (SQL) cannot be established, determine if there is an observed release as follows:
—If the sample analysis was performed under the EPA Contract Laboratory Program, use the EPA contract-required quantitation limit (CRQL) in place of the SQL.
—If the sample analysis is not performed under the EPA Contract Laboratory Program, use the detection limit (DL) in place of the SQL.
2.4
Waste characteristics.
The waste characteristics factor category includes the following factors: Hazardous waste quantity, toxicity, and as appropriate to the pathway or threat being evaluated, mobility, persistence, degradation, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential.
2.4.1
Selection of substance potentially posing greatest hazard.
For all pathways (components and threats), select the hazardous substance potentially posing the greatest hazard for the pathway (component or threat) and use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics category of the pathway (component or threat). For the three migration pathways (and threats), base the selection of this hazardous substance on the toxicity factor value for the substance, combined with its mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor values, as applicable to the migration pathway (or threat). For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, base the selection on the toxicity factor alone. For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, base the selection on the toxicity factor value for the substance, combined with its degradation factor value. Evaluation of the toxicity factor is specified in section 2.4.1.1. Use and evaluation of the mobility, persistence, degradation, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factors vary by pathway (component or threat) and are specified under the appropriate pathway (component or threat) section. Section 2.4.1.2 identifies the specific factors that are combined with toxicity in evaluating each pathway (component or threat).
2.4.1.1
Toxicity factor.
Evaluate toxicity for those hazardous substances at the site that are available to the pathway being scored. For all pathways and threats, except the surface water environmental threat, evaluate human toxicity as specified below. For the surface water environmental threat, evaluate ecosystem toxicity as specified in section 4.1.4.2.1.1.
Establish human toxicity factor values based on quantitative dose-response parameters for the following three types of toxicity:
• Cancer—Use slope factors (also referred to as cancer potency factors) combined with
weight-of-evidence ratings for carcinogenicity for all exposure routes except inhalation. Use inhalation unit risk (IUR) for inhalation exposure. If an inhalation unit risk or a slope factor is not available for a substance, use its ED
10
value to estimate a slope factor as follows:
ER09JA17.063
• Noncancer toxicological responses of chronic exposure—use reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC) values as applicable.
• Noncancer toxicological responses of acute exposure—use acute toxicity parameters, such as the LD
50
.
Assign human toxicity factor values to a hazardous substance using Table 2-4, as follows:
• If RfD/RfC and slope factor/inhalation unit risk values are available for the hazardous substance, assign the substance a value from Table 2-4 for each. Select the higher of the two values assigned and use it as the overall toxicity factor value for the hazardous substance.
• If either an RfD/RfC or slope factor/inhalation unit risk value is available, but not both, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value from Table 2-4 based solely on the available value (RfD/RfC or slope factor/inhalation unit risk).
• If neither an RfD/RfC nor slope factor/inhalation unit risk value is available, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value from Table 2-4 based solely on acute toxicity. That is, consider acute toxicity in Table 2-4 only when both RfD/RfC and slope factor/IUR values are not available.
• If neither an RfD/RfC, nor slope factor/inhalation unit risk, nor acute toxicity value is available, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value of 0 and use other hazardous substances for which information is available in evaluating the pathway.

If a toxicity factor value of 0 is assigned to all hazardous substances available to a particular pathway (that is, insufficient toxicity data are available for evaluating all the substances), use a default value of 100 as the overall human toxicity factor value for all hazardous substances available to the pathway. For hazardous substances having usable toxicity data for multiple exposure routes (for example, inhalation and ingestion), consider all exposure routes and use the highest assigned value, regardless of exposure route, as the toxicity factor value. For HRS purposes, assign both asbestos and lead (and its compounds) a human toxicity factor value of 10,000.
Separate criteria apply for assigning factor values for human toxicity and ecosystem toxicity for radionuclides (see sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2).
2.4.1.2
Hazardous substance selection.
For each hazardous substance evaluated for a migration pathway (or threat), combine the human toxicity factor value (or ecosystem toxicity factor value) for the hazardous substance with a mobility, persistence, and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor value as follows:
• Ground water migration.
—Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility factor value for the hazardous substance (see section 3.2.1).
• Surface water migration—overland/flood migration component.
—Determine a combined human toxicity/persistence factor value for the hazardous substance for the drinking water threat (see section 4.1.2.2.1).
—Determine a combined human toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the human food chain threat (see section 4.1.3.2.1).
—Determine a combined ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the environmental threat (see section 4.1.4.2.1).
• Surface water migration—ground water to surface water migration component.
—Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value for the hazardous substance for the drinking water threat (see section 4.2.2.2.1).
—Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the human food chain threat (see section 4.2.3.2.1).
—Determine a combined ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the hazardous substance for the environmental threat (see section 4.2.4.2.1).
• Air migration.
—Determine a combined human toxicity/mobility factor value for the hazardous substance (see section 6.2.1).
Determine each combined factor value for a hazardous substance by multiplying the individual factor values appropriate to the pathway (or threat). For each migration pathway (or threat) being evaluated, select the hazardous substance with the highest combined factor value and use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics factor category of the pathway (or threat).
For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, determine toxicity and toxicity/degradation factor values as follows:
• Soil exposure and subsurface intrusion—soil exposure component.
—Select the hazardous substance with the highest human toxicity factor value from among the substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for the threat evaluated and use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics factor category (see section 5.1.1.2.1).
• Soil exposure and subsurface intrusion—subsurface intrusion component.
—Determine a combined human toxicity/degradation factor value for each hazardous substance being evaluated that:
▪ Meets the criteria for observed exposure, or
▪ Meets the criteria for observed release in an area of subsurface contamination and has a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10
−5

/mol.
—Select the hazardous substance with the highest combined factor value and use that substance in evaluating the waste characteristics factor category (see sections 5.2.1.2.1 and 5.2.1.2).
2.4.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Evaluate the hazardous waste quantity factor by first assigning each source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) a source hazardous waste quantity value as specified below. Sum these values to obtain the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway being evaluated.
In evaluating the hazardous waste quantity factor for the three migration pathways, allocate hazardous substances and hazardous wastestreams to specific sources in the manner specified in section 2.2.2, except: Consider hazardous substances and hazardous wastestreams that cannot be allocated to any specific source to constitute a separate “unallocated source” for purposes of evaluating only this factor for the three migration pathways. Do not, however, include a hazardous substance or hazardous wastestream in the unallocated source for a migration pathway if there is definitive information indicating that the substance or wastestream could only have been placed in sources with a containment factor value of 0 for that migration pathway.
In evaluating the hazardous waste quantity factor for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, allocate to each area of observed contamination only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area of observed contamination and only those hazardous wastestreams that contain hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area of observed contamination. Do not consider other hazardous substances or hazardous wastestreams at the site in evaluating this factor for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.
In evaluating the hazardous waste quantity factor for the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, allocate to each area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination only those hazardous substances and hazardous wastestreams that contain hazardous substances that:
• Meet the criteria for observed exposure, or
• Meet the criteria for observed release in an area of subsurface contamination and have a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10

3
/mol.
Do not consider other hazardous substances or hazardous wastestreams at the site in evaluating this factor for the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway. When determining the hazardous waste quantity for multi-subunit structures, use the procedures identified in section 5.2.1.2.2.
2.4.2.1
Source hazardous waste quantity.
For each of the three migration pathways, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each source (including the unallocated source) having a containment factor value greater than 0 for the pathway being evaluated. Consider the unallocated source to have a containment factor value greater than 0 for each migration pathway.
For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each area of observed contamination, as applicable to the threat being evaluated.
For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each regularly occupied structure within an area of observed exposure or an area of subsurface contamination that has a structure containment factor value greater than 0. If sufficient data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk due to subsurface intrusion into a regularly occupied structure located within an area of subsurface contamination, that structure can be excluded from the area of subsurface contamination.
For determining all hazardous waste quantity calculations except for an unallocated source or an area of subsurface contamination, evaluate using the following four measures in the following hierarchy:
• Hazardous constituent quantity.
• Hazardous wastestream quantity.
• Volume.
• Area.
For the unallocated source, use only the first two measures. For an area of subsurface contamination, evaluate non-radioactive hazardous substances using only the last two measures and evaluate radioactive hazardous substances using hazardous wastestream quantity only. See also section 7.0 regarding the evaluation of radioactive substances.
Separate criteria apply for assigning a source hazardous waste quantity value for radionuclides (see section 7.2.5).
2.4.2.1.1
Hazardous constituent quantity.
Evaluate hazardous constituent quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination) based solely on the mass of CERCLA hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA
section 101(14), as amended) allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination), except:
• For a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901
et seq.,
determine its mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:
—If the hazardous waste is listed solely for Hazard Code T (toxic waste), include only the mass of constituents in the hazardous waste that are CERCLA hazardous substances and not the mass of the entire hazardous waste.
—If the hazardous waste is listed for any other Hazard Code (including T plus any other Hazard Code), include the mass of the entire hazardous waste.
• For a RCRA hazardous waste that exhibits the characteristics identified under section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, determine its mass for the evaluation of this measure as follows:
—If the hazardous waste exhibits only the characteristic of toxicity (or only the characteristic of EP toxicity), include only the mass of constituents in the hazardous waste that are CERCLA hazardous substances and not the mass of the entire hazardous waste.
—If the hazardous waste exhibits any other characteristic identified under section 3001 (including any other characteristic plus the characteristic of toxicity [or the characteristic of EP toxicity]), include the mass of the entire hazardous waste.
Based on this mass, designated as C, assign a value for hazardous constituent quantity as follows:
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous constituent quantity using the Tier A equation of Table 2-5.
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value using the Tier A equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—subsurface intrusion component, assign the area of observed exposure a value using the Tier A equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).
If the hazardous constituent quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) is adequately determined (that is, the total mass of all CERCLA hazardous substances in the source and releases from the source [or in the area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure] is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence), do not evaluate the other three measures discussed below. Instead assign these other three measures a value of 0 for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5.
If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined, assign the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) a value for hazardous constituent quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.2.

2.4.2.1.2
Hazardous wastestream quantity.
Evaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any additional CERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as amended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RCRA hazardous waste that exhibits the characteristics identified under section 3001 of RCRA, as amended, include the mass of that entire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.
Based on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as follows:
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2-5.
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value using the Tier B equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—subsurface intrusion component, assign the area of observed exposure a value using the Tier B equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).
Do not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies:
• The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) is adequately determined—that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence.
If the source is the unallocated source or if this condition applies, assign the volume and area measures a value of 0 for the source (or area of observed contamination) and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5. Otherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous wastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3.
2.4.2.1.3
Volume.
Evaluate the volume measure using the volume of the source (or the volume of the area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, restrict the use of the volume measure to those areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination as specified in sections 5.1.1.2.2 and 5.2.1.2.2.
Based on the volume, designated as V, assign a value to the volume measure as follows:
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for volume using the appropriate Tier C equation of Table 2-5.
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value for volume using the appropriate Tier C equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—subsurface intrusion component, assign the value based on the volume of the regularly occupied structures within the area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination using the Tier C equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).
If the volume of the source (or volume of the area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination, if applicable) can be determined, do not evaluate the area measure. Instead, assign the area measure a value of 0 and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.5. If the volume cannot be determined (or is not applicable for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway), assign the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) a value of 0 for the volume measure and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.4.
2.4.2.1.4
Area.
Evaluate the area measure using the area of the source (or the area of the area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). Based on this area, designated as A, assign a value to the area measure as follows:
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for area using the appropriate Tier D equation of Table 2-5.
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—soil exposure component, assign the area of observed contamination a value for area using the appropriate Tier D equation of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2).
• For the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway—subsurface intrusion component, assign a value based on the area of regularly occupied structures within the area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination using the Tier D equation of Table 5-19 (section 5.2.1.2.2).
2.4.2.1.5
Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value.
Select the highest of the values assigned to the source (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the hazardous constituent quantity, hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. Assign this value as the source hazardous waste quantity value. Do not round to the nearest integer.
2.4.2.2
Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value.
Sum the source hazardous waste quantity values assigned to all sources (including the unallocated source) or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except: If the sum is greater than 0, but less than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select a hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway from Table 2-6.

For the pathway, if hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined, assign a value as specified in the text; do not assign the value of 1.
For a migration pathway, if the hazardous constituent quantity is adequately determined (see section 2.4.2.1.1) for all sources (or all portions of sources and releases remaining after a removal action), assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway. If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions of sources or releases remaining after a removal action) assign a factor value as follows:
• If any target for that migration pathway is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 2.5), assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
• If none of the targets for that pathway is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a factor value as follows:
—If there has been no removal action, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
—If there has been a removal action:
▪ Determine values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of the removal action.
▪ If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be 100 or greater, assign either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
▪ If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be less than 100, assign a value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if the hazardous constituent quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed contamination, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more areas of observed contamination, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value.
For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if the hazardous constituent quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed exposure, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more areas of observed exposure, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or assign a factor value as follows:
• If any target for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 2.5), assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for this component.
• If none of the targets for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations and if there has been a removal or other temporary response action that does not permanently interrupt target exposure form subsurface intrusion, assign a factor value as follows:
—Determine the values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of the removal or other temporary response action.
—If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal or other temporary response action would be 100 or greater, assign either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the component.
—If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal or other temporary response action would be less than 100, assign a value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the component.
• Otherwise, if none of the targets for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations and there has not been a removal action, assign a value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater.
2.4.3
Waste characteristics factor category value.
Determine the waste characteristics factor category value as specified in section 2.4.3.1 for all pathways and threats, except the surface water-human food chain threat and the surface water-environmental threat. Determine the waste characteristics factor category value for these latter two threats as specified in section 2.4.3.2.
2.4.3.1
Factor category value.
For the pathway (component or threat) being evaluated, multiply the toxicity or combined factor value, as appropriate, from section 2.4.1.2 and the hazardous waste quantity factor value from section 2.4.2.2, subject to a maximum product of 1x10

For the surface water-human food chain threat and the surface water-environmental threat, multiply the toxicity or combined factor value, as appropriate, from section 2.4.1.2 and the hazardous waste quantity factor value from section 2.4.2.2, subject to:
• A maximum product of 1x10

,
and
• A maximum product exclusive of the bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor of 1x10

.
Based on the total waste characteristics product, assign a waste characteristics factor category value to these threats from Table 2-7.
2.5
Targets.
The types of targets evaluated include the following:
• Individual (factor name varies by pathway, component, and threat).
• Human population.
• Resources (these vary by pathway, component, and threat).
• Sensitive environments (included for the surface water migration pathway, air migration pathway, and soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway).
The factor values that may be assigned to each type of target have the same range for each pathway for which that type of target is evaluated. The factor value for most types of targets depends on whether the target is subject to actual or potential contamination for the pathway and whether the actual contamination is Level I or Level II:
• Actual contamination: Target is associated either with a sampling location that meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway or with an observed release based on direct observation for the pathway (additional criteria apply for establishing actual contamination for the human food chain threat in the surface water migration pathway, see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3). Sections 3 through 6 specify how to determine the targets associated with a sampling location or with an observed release based on direct observation. Determine whether the actual contamination is Level I or Level II as follows:
—Level I:
▪ Media-specific concentrations for the target meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway and are at or above media-specific benchmark values. These benchmark values (see section 2.5.2) include both screening concentrations and concentrations specified in regulatory limits (such as Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) values), or
▪ For the human food chain threat in the surface water migration pathway, concentrations in tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms are at or above benchmark values. Such tissue samples may be used in addition to media-specific concentrations only as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.
—Level II:
▪ Media-specific concentrations for the target meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, but are less than media-specific benchmarks. If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location has an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at the sampling location, or
▪ For observed releases or observed exposures based on direct observation, assign Level II to targets as specified in sections 3, 4, 5, and 6, or
▪ For the human food chain threat in the surface water migration pathway, concentrations in tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms, when applicable, are below benchmark values.
—If a target is subject to both Level I and Level II concentrations for a pathway
(component or threat), evaluate the target using Level I concentrations for that pathway (component or threat).
• Potential contamination: Target is subject to a potential release (that is, target is not associated with actual contamination for that pathway or threat).
Assign a factor value for individual risk as follows (select the highest value that applies to the pathway, component or threat):
• 50 points if any individual is exposed to Level I concentrations.
• 45 points if any individual is exposed to Level II concentrations.
• Maximum of 20 points if any individual is subject to potential contamination. The value assigned is 20 unless reduced by a distance or dilution weight appropriate to the pathway. Assign factor values for population and sensitive environments as follows:
• Sum Level I targets and multiply by 10. (Level I is not used for sensitive environments in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion and air migration pathways.)
• Sum Level II targets.
• Multiply potential targets in all but the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway by distance or dilution weights appropriate to the pathway, sum, and divide by 10. Distance or dilution weighting accounts for diminishing exposure with increasing distance or dilution within the different pathways. For targets within an area of subsurface contamination in the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, multiply by a weighting factor as directed in section 5.2.1.3.2.3.
• Sum the values for the three levels.
In addition, resource value points are assigned within all pathways for welfare-related impacts (for example, impacts to agricultural land), but do not depend on whether there is actual or potential contamination.
2.5.1
Determination of level of actual contamination at a sampling location.
Determine whether Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated targets) as follows:
• Select the benchmarks applicable to the pathway (component or threat) being evaluated.
• Compare the concentrations of hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the pathway (component or threat), as specified in section 2.5.2.
• Determine which level applies based on this comparison.
• If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location has an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (component or threat).
In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only those hazardous substances in the sample, that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3 of the surface water-human food chain threat. If any hazardous substance is present in more than one comparable sample for the sampling location, use the highest concentration of that hazardous substance from any of the comparable samples in making the comparisons.
Treat sets of samples that are not comparable separately and make a separate comparison for each such set.
2.5.2
Comparison to benchmarks.
Use the following media-specific benchmarks for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway (or threat):
• Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs)—ground water migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway. Use only MCLG values greater than 0.
• Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—ground water migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.
• Food and Drug Administration Action Level (FDAAL) for fish or shellfish—human food chain threat in surface water migration pathway.
• EPA Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC/National Recommended Water Quality Criteria) for protection of aquatic life—environmental threat in surface water migration pathway.
• EPA Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALAC)—environmental threat in surface water migration pathway.
• National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)—air migration pathway.
• National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)—air migration pathway. Use only those NESHAPs promulgated in ambient concentration units.
• Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10
−6
individual cancer risk for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway or subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway) or for oral exposures (ground water migration pathway; drinking water and human food chain threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway).
• Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological responses corresponding to the RfC for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway and subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway) or RfD for oral exposures (ground water migration pathway; drinking
water and human food chain threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway).
Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (component or threat) being evaluated as specified in sections 3 through 6. Compare the concentration of each hazardous substance from the sampling location to its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (component or threat). Use only those samples and only those hazardous substances in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of any applicable hazardous substance from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (or threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the hazardous substance, assign Level I if the concentration of the hazardous substance equals or exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration.
If no hazardous substance individually equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, but more than one hazardous substance either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the sample (or comparable samples) or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3), calculate the indices I and J specified below based on these hazardous substances.
For those hazardous substances that are carcinogens (that is, those having either a carcinogen weight-of-evidence classification of A, B, or C or a weight-of-evidence classification of carcinogenic to humans, likely to be carcinogenic to humans, or suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential), calculate an index I for the sample location as follows:
ER09JA17.064
Where:
C
i
= Concentration of hazardous substance i in sample (or highest concentration of hazardous substance i from among comparable samples).
SC
i
= Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to its 10
−6
individual cancer risk for applicable exposure (inhalation or oral) for hazardous substance i.
n = Number of applicable hazardous substances in sample (or comparable samples) that are carcinogens and for which an SC
i
is available.
For those hazardous substances for which an RfD or RfC is available, calculate an index J for the sample location as follows:
ER09JA17.065
Where:
C
j
= Concentration of hazardous substance j in sample (or highest concentration of hazardous substance j from among comparable samples).
CR
j
= Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological responses corresponding to RfD or RfC for applicable exposure (inhalation or oral) for hazardous substance j.
m = Number of applicable hazardous substances in sample (or comparable samples) for which a CR
j
is available.
If either I or J equals or exceeds 1, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (component or threat). If both I and J are less than 1, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level II concentrations for that pathway (component or threat). If, for the sampling location, there are sets of samples that are not comparable, calculate I and J separately for each such set, and use the highest calculated values of I and J to assign Level I and Level II.
See sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 for criteria for determining the level of contamination for radioactive substances.

# 3.0 Ground Water Migration Pathway
Evaluate the ground water migration pathway based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 3-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category.
Determine the ground water migration pathway score (S
gw
) in terms of the factor category values as follows:
EC15NO91.145
where:
LR = Likelihood of release factor category value.
WC = Waste characteristics factor category value.
T = Targets factor category value.
SF = Scaling factor.
Table 3-1 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
Calculate a separate ground water migration pathway score for each aquifer, using the factor category values for that aquifer for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. In doing so, include both the targets using water from that aquifer and the targets using water from all overlying aquifers through which the hazardous substances would migrate to reach the aquifer being evaluated. Assign the highest ground water migration pathway score that results for any aquifer as the ground water migration pathway score for the site.

3.0.1
General considerations
3.0.1.1
Ground water target distance limit.
The target distance limit defines the maximum distance from the sources at the site over which targets are evaluated. Use a target distance limit of 4 miles for the ground water migration pathway, except when aquifer discontinuities apply (see section 3.0.1.2.2). Furthermore, consider any well with an observed release from a source at the site (see section 3.1.1) to lie within the target distance limit of the site, regardless of the well's distance from the sources at the site.
For sites that consist solely of a contaminated ground water plume with no identified source, begin measuring the 4-mile target distance limit at the center of the area of observed ground water contamination. Determine the area of observed ground water contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.
3.0.1.2
Aquifer boundaries.
Combine multiple aquifers into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes if aquifer interconnections can be established for these aquifers. In contrast, restrict aquifer boundaries if aquifer discontinuities can be established.
3.0.1.2.1
Aquifer interconnections.
Evaluate whether aquifer interconnections occur within 2 miles of the sources at the site. If they occur within this 2-mile distance, combine the aquifers having interconnections in scoring the site. In addition, if observed ground water contamination attributable to the sources at the site extends beyond 2 miles from the sources, use any locations within the limits of this observed ground water contamination in evaluating aquifer interconnections. If data are not adequate to establish aquifer interconnections, evaluate the aquifers as separate aquifers.
3.0.1.2.2
Aquifer discontinuities.
Evaluate whether aquifer discontinuities occur within the 4-mile target distance limit. An aquifer discontinuity occurs for scoring purposes only when a geologic, topographic, or other structure or feature entirely transects an aquifer within the 4-mile target distance limit, thereby creating a continuous boundary to ground water flow within this limit. If two or more aquifers can be combined into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes, an aquifer discontinuity occurs only when the structure or feature entirely transects the boundaries of this single hydrologic unit.
When an aquifer discontinuity is established within the 4-mile target distance limit, exclude that portion of the aquifer beyond the discontinuity in evaluating the ground water migration pathway. However, if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity within the 4-mile target distance limit, do not consider this to be a discontinuity in scoring the site.
3.0.1.3
Karst aquifer.
Give a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at
the site special consideration in the evaluation of two potential to release factors (depth to aquifer in section 3.1.2.3 and travel time in section 3.1.2.4), one waste characteristics factor (mobility in section 3.2.1.2), and two targets factors (nearest well in section 3.3.1 and potential contamination in section 3.3.2.4).
3.1
Likelihood of release.
For an aquifer, evaluate the likelihood of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
3.1.1
Observed release.
Establish an observed release to an aquifer by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the aquifer. Base this demonstration on either:
• Direct observation—a material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been deposited into or has been observed entering the aquifer.
• Chemical analysis—an analysis of ground water samples from the aquifer indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the source itself consists of a ground water plume with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.
If an observed release can be established for the aquifer, assign the aquifer an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.3. If an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.2.
3.1.2
Potential to release.
Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer. Evaluate potential to release based on four factors: containment, net precipitation, depth to aquifer, and travel time. For sources overlying karst terrain, give any karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site special consideration in evaluating depth to aquifer and travel time, as specified in sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4.
3.1.2.1
Containment.
Assign a containment factor value from table 3-2 to each source at the site. Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources with a source hazardous waste quantity value of 0.5 or more (see section 2.4.2.1.5). (Do not include this minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this pathway.) Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in Table ­3-1.
If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest value assigned to the sources at the site and assign it as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.1.2.2
Net precipitation.
Assign a net precipitation factor value to the site. Figure 3-2 provides computed net precipitation factor values, based on site location. Where necessary, determine the net precipitation factor value as follows:
• Determine monthly precipitation and monthly evapotranspiration:
-Use local measured monthly averages.
-When local data are not available, use monthly averages from the nearest National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather station that is in a similar geographic setting.

Depth to aquifer.
Evaluate depth to aquifer by determining the depth from the lowest known point of hazardous substances at a site to the top of the aquifer being evaluated, considering all layers in that interval. Measure the depth to an aquifer as the distance from the surface to the top of the aquifer minus the distance from the surface to the lowest known point of hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for that aquifer. In evaluating depth to aquifer in karst terrain, assign a thickness of 0 feet to a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site. Based on the calculated depth, assign a value from table 3-5 to the depth to aquifer factor.
Determine the depth to aquifer only at locations within 2 miles of the sources at the site, except: if observed ground water contamination attributable to sources at the site extends more than 2 miles beyond these sources, use any location within the limits of this observed ground water contamination when evaluating the depth to aquifer factor for any aquifer that does not have an observed release. If the necessary geologic information is available at multiple locations, calculate the depth to aquifer at each location. Use the location having the smallest depth to assign the factor value. Enter this value in table 3-1.

3.1.2.4
Travel time.
Evaluate the travel time factor based on the geologic materials in the interval between the lowest known point of hazardous substances at the site and the top of the aquifer being evaluated. Assign a value to the travel time factor as follows:
• If the depth to aquifer (see section 3.1.2.3) is 10 feet or less, assign a value of 35.
• If, for the interval being evaluated, all layers that underlie a portion of the sources at the site are karst, assign a value of 35.
• Otherwise:
-Select the lowest hydraulic conductivity layer(s) from within the above interval.
Consider only layers at least 3 feet thick. However, do not consider layers or portions of layers within the first 10 feet of the depth to the aquifer.
-Determine hydraulic conductivities for individual layers from table 3-6 or from in-situ or laboratory tests. Use representative, measured, hydraulic conductivity values whenever available.
-If more than one layer has the same lowest hydraulic conductivity, include all such layers and sum their thicknesses. Assign a thickness of 0 feet to a karst layer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site.
-Assign a value from table 3-7 to the travel time factor, based on the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the lowest hydraulic conductivity layer(s).

3.1.3
Calculation of likelihood of release factor category value.

Otherwise, assign the potential to release factor value for that aquifer as the likelihood of release value. Enter the value assigned in table 3-1.
3.2
Waste characteristics.
Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for an aquifer based on two factors: toxicity/mobility and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to ground water. Such hazardous substances include:
• Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water.
• All hazardous substances associated with a source that has a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 3.1.2.1).
3.2.1
Toxicity/mobility.
For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, and a combined toxicity/mobility factor value as specified in the following sections. Select the toxicity/mobility factor value for the aquifer being evaluated as specified in section 3.2.1.3.
3.2.1.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in Section 2.4.1.1.
3.2.1.2
Mobility.
Assign a mobility factor value to each hazardous substance for the aquifer being evaluated as follows:
• For any hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to one or more aquifers underlying the sources at the site, regardless of the aquifer being evaluated, assign a mobility factor value of 1.
• For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to at least one of the aquifers, assign that hazardous substance a mobility factor value from table 3-8 for the aquifer being evaluated, based on its water solubility and distribution coefficient (K
d
).
• If the hazardous substance cannot be assigned a mobility factor value because data on its water solubility or distribution coefficient are not available, use other hazardous substances for which information is available in evaluating the pathway.

• If none of the hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated can be assigned a mobility factor value, use a default value of 0.002 as the mobility factor value for all these hazardous substances.
Determine the water solubility to be used in table 3-8 for the hazardous substance as follows (use this same water solubility for all aquifers):
• For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the hazardous substance is present or deposited as a liquid, use the water solubility category “Present as Liquid” in table 3-8 to assign the mobility factor value to that hazardous substance.
• Otherwise:
-For any hazardous substance that is a metal (or metalloid) and that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, establish a water solubility for the hazardous substance as follows:
-Determine the overall range of water solubilities for compounds of this hazardous substance (consider all compounds for which adequate water solubility information is available, not just compounds identified as present at the site).
-Calculate the geometric mean of the highest and the lowest water solubility in this range.
-Use this geometric mean as the water solubility in assigning the hazardous substance a mobility factor value from table 3-8.
-For any other hazardous substance (either organic or inorganic) that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, use the water solubility of that hazardous substance to assign a mobility factor value from table 3-8 to the hazardous substance.
For the aquifer being evaluated, determine the distribution coefficient to be used in table 3-8 for the hazardous substance as follows:
• For any hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, if the entire interval from a source at the site to the aquifer being evaluated is karst, use the distribution coefficient category “Karst” in table 3-8 in assigning the mobility factor value for that hazardous substance for that aquifer.
• Otherwise:
-For any hazardous substance that is a metal (or metalloid) and that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, use the distribution coefficient for the metal or (metalloid) to assign a mobility factor value from table 3-8 for that hazardous substance.
-For any other inorganic hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis,
use the distribution coefficient for that inorganic hazardous substance, if available, to assign a mobility factor value from table 3-8. If the distribution coefficient is not available, use a default value of “less than 10” as the distribution coefficient, except: for asbestos use a default value of “greater than 1,000” as the distribution coefficient.
-For any hazardous substance that is organic and that does not meet the criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis, establish a distribution coefficient for that hazardous substance as follows:
-Estimate the K
d
range for the hazardous substance using the following equation:
K
d
= (K
oc
)(f
s
)
where:
K
oc
= Soil-water partition coefficient for organic carbon for the hazardous substance.
f
s
= Sorbent content (fraction of clays plus organic carbon) in the subsurface.
-Use f
s
values of 0.03 and 0.77 in the above equation to establish the upper and lower values of the K
d
range for the hazardous substance.
-Calculate the geometric mean of the upper and lower K
d
range values. Use this geometric mean as the distribution coefficient in assigning the hazardous substance a mobility factor value from table 3-8.
3.2.1.3
Calculation of toxicity/mobility factor value.
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from table 3-9, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/mobility factor value for the aquifer being evaluated to assign the value to the toxicity/mobility factor for that aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.

3.2.3
Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value.
Multiply the toxicity/mobility and hazardous waste quantity factor values, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10

. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.3
Targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category for an aquifer based on four factors: nearest well, population, resources, and Wellhead Protection Area. Evaluate these four factors based on targets within the target distance limit specified in section 3.0.1.1 and the aquifer boundaries specified in section 3.0.1.2. Determine the targets to be included in evaluating these factors for an aquifer as specified in section 3.0.
3.3.1
Nearest well.
In evaluating the nearest well factor, include both the drinking water wells drawing from the aquifer being evaluated and those drawing from overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. Include standby wells in evaluating this factor only if they are used for drinking water supply at least once every year.
If there is an observed release by direct observation for a drinking water well within the target distance limit, assign Level II concentrations to that well. However, if one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release for that well, determine if that well is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination.
Assign a value for the nearest well factor as follows:
• If one or more drinking water wells is subject to Level I concentrations, assign a value of 50.
• If not, but if one or more drinking water wells is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.
• If none of the drinking water wells is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a value as follows:
-If one of the target aquifers is a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site and any well draws drinking water from this karst aquifer within the target distance limit, assign a value of 20.
-If not, determine the shortest distance to any drinking water well, as measured from any source at the site with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0. Select a value from table 3-11 based on this distance. Assign it as the value for the nearest well factor.
Enter the value assigned to the nearest well factor in table 3-1.

3.3.2
Population.
In evaluating the population factor, include those persons served by drinking water wells within the target distance limit specified in section 3.0.1.1. For the aquifer being evaluated, count those persons served by wells in that aquifer and those persons served by wells in overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. Include residents, students, and workers who regularly use the water. Exclude transient populations such as customers and travelers passing through the area. Evaluate the population based on the location of the water supply wells, not on the location of residences, work places, etc. When a standby well is maintained on a regular basis so that water can be withdrawn, include it in evaluating the population factor.
In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.
In determining the population served by a well, if the water from the well is blended with other water (for example, water from other ground water wells or surface water intakes), apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system to the well based on the well's relative contribution to the total blended system. In estimating the well's relative contribution, assume each well and intake contributes equally and apportion the population accordingly, except: if the relative contribution of any one well or intake exceeds 40 percent based on average annual pumpage or capacity, estimate the relative contribution of the wells and intakes considering the following data, if available:
• Average annual pumpage from the ground water wells and surface water intakes in the blended system.
• Capacities of the wells and intakes in the blended system.
For systems with standby ground water wells or standby surface water intakes, apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system as described above, except:
• Exclude standby surface water intakes in apportioning the population.
• When using pumpage data for a standby ground water well, use average pumpage for the period during which the standby well is used rather than average annual pumpage.
• For that portion of the total population that could be apportioned to a standby ground water well, assign that portion of the population either to that standby well or to the other ground water well(s) and surface water intake(s) that serve that population; do not assign that portion of the population both to the standby well and to the other well(s) and intake(s) in the blended system. Use the apportioning that results in the highest population factor value. (Either include all standby well(s) or exclude some or all of the standby well(s) as appropriate to obtain this highest value.) Note that the specific standby well(s) included or excluded and, thus, the specific apportioning may vary in evaluating different aquifers and in evaluating the surface water pathway.
3.3.2.1
Level of contamination.
Evaluate the population served by water from a point of withdrawal based on the level of contamination for that point of withdrawal. Use the applicable factor: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, or potential contamination.
If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release for a point of withdrawal and there is no observed release by direct observation for that point of withdrawal, evaluate that point of withdrawal using the potential contamination factor in section 3.3.2.4. If
there is an observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for that point of withdrawal. However, if one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release for the point of withdrawal, determine which factor (Level I or Level II concentrations) applies to that point of withdrawal as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination. Evaluate the point of withdrawal using the Level I concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.2 or the Level II concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.3, as appropriate.
For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 3.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
3.3.2.2
Level I concentrations.
Sum the number of people served by drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to Level I concentrations. Multiply this sum by 10. Assign this product as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.3.2.3
Level II concentrations.
Sum the number of people served by drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.3.2.4
Potential contamination.
Determine the number of people served by drinking water from points of withdrawal subject to potential contamination. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations factors.
Assign distance-weighted population values from table 3-12 to this population as follows:
• Use the “Karst” portion of table 3-12 to assign values only for that portion of the population served by points of withdrawal that draw drinking water from a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site.
-For this portion of the population, determine the number of people included within each “Karst” distance category in table 3-12.

c
Use only for karst aquifers underlying any portion of the sources at the site.
-Assign a distance-weighted population value for each distance category based on the number of people included within the distance category.
• Use the “Other Than Karst” portion of table 3-12 for the remainder of the population served by points of withdrawal subject to potential contamination.

-Assign a distance-weighted population value for each distance category based on the number of people included within the distance category.
Calculate the value for the potential contamination factor (PC) as follows:
EC15NO91.147
where:
W
i
= Distance-weighted population from “Other Than Karst” portion of table 3-12 for distance category i.
K
i
= Distance-weighted population from “Karst” portion of table 3-12 for distance category i.
n = Number of distance categories.
If PC is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PC is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.3.2.5
Calculation of population factor value.
Sum the factor values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the population factor value for the aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.3.3
Resources.
To evaluate the resources factor, select the highest value specified below that applies for the aquifer being evaluated. Assign this value as the resources factor value for the aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
Assign a resources value of 5 if water drawn from any target well for the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0) is used for one or more of the following purposes:
• Irrigation (5-acre minimum) of commercial food crops or commercial forage crops.
• Watering of commercial livestock.
• Ingredient in commercial food preparation.
• Supply for commercial aquaculture.
• Supply for a major or designated water recreation area, excluding drinking water use.
Assign a resources value of 5 if no drinking water wells are within the target distance limit, but the water in the aquifer being evaluated or any overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0) is usable for drinking water purposes.
Assign a resources value of 0 if none of the above applies.
3.3.4
Wellhead Protection Area.
Evaluate the Wellhead Protection Area factor based on Wellhead Protection Areas designated according to section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended. Consider only those Wellhead Protection Areas applicable to the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers (as specified in section 3.0). Select the highest value below that applies. Assign it as the value for the Wellhead Protection Area factor for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in table 3-1.
Assign a value of 20 if either of the following criteria applies for the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers:
• A source with a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 lies, either partially or fully, within or above the designated Wellhead Protection Area.
• Observed ground water contamination attributable to the sources at the site lies, either partially or fully, within the designated Wellhead Protection Area.
If neither criterion applies, assign a value of 5, if, within the target distance limit, there is a designated Wellhead Protection Area applicable to the aquifer being evaluated or overlying aquifers.
Assign a value of 0 if none of the above applies.
3.3.5
Calculation of targets factor category value.
Sum the factor values for nearest well, population, resources, and Wellhead Protection Area. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Use this sum as the targets factor category value for the aquifer. Enter this value in table 3-1.
3.4
Ground water migration score for an aquifer.
For the aquifer being evaluated, multiply the factor category values for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the ground water migration pathway score for the aquifer. Enter this score in table 3-1.
3.5
Calculation of ground water migration pathway score.
Calculate a ground water migration score for each aquifer underlying the sources at the site, as appropriate. Assign the highest ground water migration score for an aquifer as the ground water migration pathway score (S
gw
) for the site. Enter this score in table 3-1.

# 4.0 Surface Water Migration Pathway
4.0.1
Migration components.
Evaluate the surface water migration pathway based on two migration components:
• Overland/flood migration to surface water (see section 4.1).
• Ground water to surface water migration (see section 4.2).
Evaluate each component based on the same three threats: drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat.
Score one or both components, considering their relative importance. If only one component is scored, assign its score as the surface water migration pathway score. If both components are scored, select the higher of the two scores and assign it as the surface water migration pathway score.
4.0.2
Surface water categories.
For HRS purposes, classify surface water into four categories: rivers, lakes, oceans, and coastal tidal waters.
Rivers include:
• Perennially flowing waters from point of origin to the ocean or to coastal tidal waters, whichever comes first, and wetlands contiguous to these flowing waters.
• Aboveground portions of disappearing rivers.
• Man-made ditches only insofar as they perennially flow into other surface water.
• Intermittently flowing waters and contiguous intermittently flowing ditches only in arid or semiarid areas with less than 20 inches of mean annual precipitation.
Lakes include:
• Natural and man-made lakes (including impoundments) that lie along rivers, but excluding the Great Lakes.
• Isolated, but perennial, lakes, ponds, and wetlands.
• Static water channels or oxbow lakes contiguous to rivers.
• Small rivers, without diking, that merge into surrounding perennially inundated wetlands.
• Wetlands contiguous to water bodies defined here as lakes.
Ocean and ocean-like water bodies include:
• Ocean areas seaward from the baseline of the Territorial Sea. (This baseline represents the generalized coastline of the United States. It is parallel to the seaward limit of the Territorial Sea and other maritime limits such as the inner boundary of Federal fisheries jurisdiction and the limit of States jurisdiction under the Submerged Lands Act, as amended.)
• The Great Lakes.
• Wetlands contiguous to the Great Lakes.
Coastal tidal waters include:
• Embayments, harbors, sounds, estuaries, back bays, lagoons, wetlands, etc. seaward from mouths of rivers and landward from the baseline of the Territorial Sea.
4.1
Overland/flood migration component.
Use the overland/flood migration component to evaluate surface water threats that result from overland migration of hazardous substances from a source at the site to surface water. Evaluate three types of threats for this component: drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat.
4.1.1
General considerations.
4.1.1.1
Definition of hazardous substance migration path for overland/flood migration component.
The hazardous substance migration path includes both the overland segment and the in-water segment that hazardous substances would take as they migrate away from sources at the site:
• Begin the overland segment at a source and proceed downgradient to the probable point of entry to surface water.
• Begin the in-water segment at this probable point of entry.
-For rivers, continue the in-water segment in the direction of flow (including any tidal flows) for the distance established by the target distance limit (see section 4.1.1.2).
-For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes, do not consider flow direction. Instead apply the target distance limit as an arc.
-If the in-water segment includes both rivers and lakes (or oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes), apply the target distance limit to their combined in-water segments.
For sites that consist of contaminated sediments with no identified source, the hazardous substance migration path consists solely of the in-water segment specified in section 4.1.1.2.
Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit. If the site is in more than one watershed, define a separate hazardous substance migration path for each watershed. Evaluate the overland/flood migration component for each watershed separately as specified in section 4.1.1.3.
4.1.1.2
Target distance limit.
The target distance limit defines the maximum distance over which targets are considered in evaluating the site. Determine a separate target distance limit for each watershed as follows:
• If there is no observed release to surface water in the watershed or if there is an observed release only by direct observation (see section 4.1.2.1.1), begin measuring the target distance limit for the watershed at the probable point of entry to surface water and extend it for 15 miles along the surface water from that point.
• If there is an observed release from the site to the surface water in the watershed that is based on sampling, begin measuring the target distance limit for the watershed at the probable point of entry; extend the target distance limit either for 15 miles along the surface water or to the most distant sample point that meets the criteria for an observed release to that watershed, whichever is greater.
In evaluating the site, include only surface water targets (for example, intakes, fisheries, sensitive environments) that are within or contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path and located, partially or wholly, at or between the probable point of entry and the target distance limit applicable to the watershed:
• If flow within the hazardous substance migration path is reversed by tides, evaluate upstream targets only if there is documentation that the tidal run could carry substances from the site as far as those upstream targets.
• Determine whether targets within or contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path are subject to actual or potential contamination as follows:
-If a target is located, partially or wholly, either at or between the probable point of entry and any sampling point that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed or at a point that meets the criteria for an observed release by direct observation, evaluate that target as subject to actual contamination, except as otherwise specified for fisheries in section 4.1.3.3 and for wetlands in section 4.1.4.3.1.1. If the actual contamination is based on direct observation, assign Level II to the actual contamination. However, if the actual contamination is based on samples, determine whether the actual contamination is at Level I or Level II concentrations as specified in sections 4.1.2.3, 4.1.3.3, and 4.1.4.3.1.
-If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the target distance limit for the watershed, but not at or between the probable point of entry and any sampling point that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed, nor at a point that meets the criteria for an observed release by direct observation, evaluate it as subject to potential contamination.
For sites consisting solely of contaminated sediments with no identified source, determine the target distance limit as follows:
• If there is a clearly defined direction of flow for the surface water body (or bodies) containing the contaminated sediments, begin measuring the target distance limit at the point of observed sediment contamination that is farthest upstream (that is, at the location of the farthest available upstream sediment sample that meets the criteria for an observed release); extend the target distance limit either for 15 miles along the surface water or to the most distant downstream sample point that meets the criteria for an observed release to that watershed, whichever is greater.
• If there is no clearly defined direction of flow, begin measuring the target distance limit at the center of the area of observed sediment contamination. Extend the target distance limit as an arc either for 15 miles along the surface water or to the most distant sample point that meets the criteria for an observed release to that watershed, whichever is greater. Determine the area of observed sediment contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.
Note that the hazardous substance migration path for these contaminated sediment sites consists solely of the in-water segment defined by the target distance limit; there is no overland segment.
For these contaminated sediment sites, include only those targets (for example, intakes, fisheries, sensitive environments) that are within or contiguous to the hazardous substance migration path and located, wholly or partially, within the target distance limit for the site. Determine whether these targets are subject to actual or potential contamination as follows:
• If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the area of observed sediment contamination, evaluate it as subject to actual contamination, except as otherwise specified for fisheries in section 4.1.3.3 and wetlands in section 4.1.4.3.1.1.
-If a drinking water target is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level II concentrations.
-If a human food chain target or environmental target is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I or Level II concentrations, as appropriate (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.1.4.3.1).
• If a target is located, partially or wholly, within the target distance limit for the watershed, but not within the area of observed sediment contamination, evaluate it as subject to potential contamination.
4.1.1.3
Evaluation of overland/flood migration component.
Evaluate the drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat for each watershed for this component based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 4-1 indicates the factors included within each factor category for each type of threat.
Determine the overland/flood migration component score (S
of
) for a watershed in terms of the factor category values as follows:
EC15NO91.148
where:
LR
i
= Likelihood of release factor category value for threat i (that is, drinking water, human food chain, or environmental threat).
WC
i
= Waste characteristics factor category value for threat i.
T
i
= Targets factor category value for threat i.
SF = Scaling factor.
Table 4-1 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
If the site is in only one watershed, assign the overland/flood migration score for that watershed as the overland/flood migration component score for the site.

• Select the highest overland/flood migration component score from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the overland/flood migration component score for the site.
4.1.2
Drinking water threat.
Evaluate the drinking water threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.
4.1.2.1
Drinking water threat—likelihood of release.
Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
4.1.2.1.1
Observed release.
Establish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on either:
• Direct observation:
-A material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering surface water through migration or is known to have entered surface water through direct deposition, or
-A source area has been flooded at a time that hazardous substances were present, and one or more hazardous substances were in contact with the flood waters, or
-When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to surface water, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be used to establish an observed release.
• Chemical analysis:
-Analysis of surface water, benthic, or sediment samples indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3).
-Limit comparisons to similar types of samples and background concentrations—for example, compare surface water samples to surface water background concentrations.
-For benthic samples, limit comparisons to essentially sessile organisms.
-Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.
If an observed release can be established for a watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.3. If no observed release can be established for the watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 0 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.
4.1.2.1.2
Potential to release.
Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the watershed. Evaluate potential to release based on two components: potential to release by overland flow (see section 4.1.2.1.2.1) and potential to release by flood (see section 4.1.2.1.2.2). Sum the values for these two components to obtain the potential to release factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum value of 500.
4.1.2.1.2.1
Potential to release by overland flow.
Evaluate potential to release by overland flow for the watershed based on three factors: containment, runoff, and distance to surface water.
Assign potential to release by overland flow a value of 0 for the watershed if:
• No overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path can be defined for the watershed, or
• The overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed exceeds 2 miles before surface water is encountered.
If either condition applies, enter a value of 0 in table 4-1 and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.2 to evaluate potential to release by flood. If neither applies, proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 to evaluate potential to release by overland flow.
4.1.2.1.2.1.1
Containment.
Determine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:
• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign
the containment factor a value of 10 for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4-2 to each source at the site that can potentially release hazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. Assign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:
-Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the minimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
-If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except potential to release by flood as specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.
4.1.2.1.2.1.2
Runoff.
Evaluate runoff based on three components: rainfall, drainage area, and soil group.

Rainfall. Determine the 2-year, 24-hour rainfall for the site. Use site-specific, 2-year, 24-hour rainfall data if records are available for at least 20 years. If such site-specific data are not available, estimate the 2-year, 24-hour rainfall for the site from a rainfall-frequency map. Do not round the rainfall value to the nearest integer.
Drainage area. Determine the drainage area for the sources at the site. Include in this drainage area both the source areas and the area upgradient of the sources, but exclude any portion of this drainage area for which runoff is diverted from entering the sources by storm sewers or run-on control and/or runoff management systems.

4.1.2.1.2.1.3
Distance to surface water.
Evaluate the distance to surface water as the shortest distance, along the overland segment, from any source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 to either the mean high water level for tidal waters or the mean water level for other surface waters. Based on this distance, assign a value from table 4-7 to the distance to surface water factor for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.1.2.1.4
Calculation of factor value for potential to release by overland flow.
Sum the factor values for runoff and distance to surface water for the watershed and multiply this sum by the factor value for containment. Assign the resulting product as the factor value for potential to release by overland flow for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.1.2.2
Potential to release by flood.
Evaluate potential to release by flood for each watershed as the product of two factors: containment (flood) and flood frequency. Evaluate potential to release by flood separately for each source that is within the watershed. Furthermore, for each source, evaluate potential to release by flood separately for each category of floodplain in which the source lies. (See section 4.1.2.1.2.2.2 for the applicable floodplain categories.) Calculate the value for the potential to release by flood factor as specified in 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.
4.1.2.1.2.2.1
Containment (flood).
For each source within the watershed, separately evaluate the containment (flood) factor for each category of floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly located. Assign a containment (flood) factor value from table 4-8 to each floodplain category applicable to that source. Assign a containment (flood) factor value of 0 to each floodplain category in which the source does not lie.
4.1.2.1.2.2.2
Flood frequency.
For each source within the watershed, separately evaluate the flood frequency factor for each category of floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly located. Assign a flood
frequency factor value from table 4-9 to each floodplain category in which the source is located.
4.1.2.1.2.2.3
Calculation of factor value for potential to release by flood.
For each source within the watershed and for each category of floodplain in which the source is partially or wholly located, calculate a separate potential to release by flood factor value. Calculate this value as the product of the containment (flood) value and the flood frequency value applicable to the source for the floodplain category. Select the highest value calculated for those sources that meet the minimum size requirement specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and assign it as the value for the potential to release by flood factor for the watershed. However, if, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, select the highest value calculated for the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the value for this factor.

Otherwise, assign the potential to release factor value for that watershed as the likelihood of release factor category value for that watershed. Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
4.1.2.2
Drinking water threat-waste characteristics.
Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances that are available to migrate from the sources at the site to surface water in the watershed via the overland/flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed (see section 4.1.1.1). Such hazardous substances include:
• Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water in the watershed.
• All hazardous substances associated with a source that has a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, and 4.1.2.1.2.2.1).
4.1.2.2.1
Toxicity/persistence.
For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a persistence factor value, and a combined toxicity/persistence factor value as specified in sections 4.1.2.2.1.1 through 4.1.2.2.1.3. Select the toxicity/persistence factor value for the watershed as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.3.
4.1.2.2.1.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
4.1.2.2.1.2
Persistence.
Assign a persistence factor value to each hazardous substance. In assigning this value, evaluate persistence based primarily on the half-life of the hazardous substance in surface water and secondarily on the sorption of the hazardous substance to sediments. The half-life in surface water is defined for HRS purposes as the time required to reduce the initial concentration in surface water by one-half as a result of the combined decay processes of biodegradation, hydrolysis, photolysis, and volatilization. Sorption to sediments is evaluated for the HRS based on the logarithm of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log K
ow
) of the hazardous substance.
Estimate the half-life (t
1/2
) of a hazardous substance as follows:
EC15NO91.149
where:
h = Hydrolysis half-life.
b = Biodegradation half-life.
p = Photolysis half-life.
v = Volatilization half-life.
If one or more of these four component half-lives cannot be estimated for the hazardous substance from available data, delete that component half-life from the above equation. If none of these four component half-lives can be estimated for the hazardous substance from available data, use the default procedure indicated below. Estimate a half-life for the hazardous substance for lakes or for rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, as appropriate.
If a half-life can be estimated for a hazardous substance:
• Assign that hazardous substance a persistence factor value from the appropriate portion of table 4-10 (that is lakes; or rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes).
• Select the appropriate portion of table 4-10 as follows:
-If there is one or more drinking water intakes along the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed, select the nearest drinking water intake as measured from the probable point of entry. If the in-water segment between the probable point of entry and this selected intake includes both lakes and other water bodies, use the lakes portion of table 4-10 only if more than half the distance to this selected intake lies in lake(s). Otherwise, use the rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes portion of table 4-10. For contaminated sediments with no identified source, use the point where measurement begins (see section 4.1.1.2) rather than the probable point of entry.
-If there are no drinking water intakes but there are intakes or points of use for any of the resource types listed in section 4.1.2.3.3, select the nearest such intake or point of use. Select the portion of table 4-10 based on this intake or point of use in the manner specified for drinking water intakes.
-If there are no drinking water intakes and no specified resource intakes and points of use, but there is another type of resource listed in section 4.1.2.3.3 (for example, the water is usable for drinking water purposes even though not used), select the portion of table 4-10 based on the nearest point of this resource in the manner specified for drinking water intakes.

If a half-life cannot be estimated for a hazardous substance from available data, use the following default procedure to assign a persistence factor value to that hazardous substance:
• For those hazardous substances that are metals (or metalloids), assign a persistence factor value of 1 as a default for all surface water bodies.
• For other hazardous substances (both organic and inorganic), assign a persistence factor value of 0.4 as a default for rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, and a persistence factor value of 0.07 as a default for lakes. Select the appropriate value in the same manner specified for using table 4-10.
Use the persistence factor value assigned based on half-life or the default procedure unless the hazardous substance can be assigned a higher factor value from Table ­4-11, based on its Log K

4.1.2.3
Drinking water threat-targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category for each watershed based on three factors: nearest intake, population, and resources.
To evaluate the nearest intake and population factors, determine whether the target surface water intakes are subject to actual or potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2. Use either an observed release based on direct observation at the intake or the exposure concentrations from samples (or comparable samples) taken at or beyond the intake to make this determination (see section 4.1.2.1.1). The exposure concentrations for a sample (that is, surface water, benthic, or sediment sample) consist of the concentrations of those hazardous substances present that are significantly above background levels and attributable at least in part to the site (that is, those hazardous substance concentrations that meet the criteria for an observed release).
When an intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. If the actual contamination is based on an observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for that intake. However, if the actual contamination is based on an observed release from samples, determine which level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure concentrations from samples (or comparable samples) to health-based benchmarks as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 (section 3.3.1) in determining the level of contamination from samples. For contaminated sediments with no identified source, evaluate the actual contamination using Level II concentrations (see section 4.1.1.2).
4.1.2.3.1
Nearest intake.
Evaluate the nearest intake factor based on the drinking water intakes along the overland/flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed. Include standby intakes in evaluating this factor only if they are used for supply at least once a year.
Assign the nearest intake factor a value as follows and enter the value in table 4-1:
• If one or more of these drinking water intakes is subject to Level I concentrations as specified in section 4.1.2.3, assign a factor value of 50.
• If not, but if one or more of these drinking water intakes is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a factor value of 45.
• If none of these drinking water intakes is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, determine the nearest of these drinking water intakes, as measured from the probable point of entry (or from the point where measurement begins for contaminated sediments with no identified source). Assign a dilution weight from table 4-13 to this intake, based on the type of surface water body in which it is located. Multiply this dilution weight by 20, round the product to the nearest integer, and assign it as the factor value.
Assign the dilution weight from table 4-13 as follows:

It is parallel to the seaward limit of the Territorial Sea and other maritime limits such as the inner boundary of the Federal fisheries jurisdiction and the limit of States jurisdiction under the Submerged Lands Act, as amended.
• For a river (that is, surface water body types specified in table 4-13 as minimal stream through very large river), assign a dilution weight based on the average annual flow in the river at the intake. If available, use the average annual discharge as defined in the U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources Data Annual Report. Otherwise, estimate the average annual flow.
• For a lake, assign a dilution weight as follows:
-For a lake that has surface water flow entering the lake, assign a dilution weight based on the sum of the average annual flows for the surface water bodies entering the lake up to the point of the intake.
-For a lake that has no surface water flow entering, but that does have surface water flow leaving, assign a dilution weight based on the sum of the average annual flows for the surface water bodies leaving the lake.
-For a closed lake (that is, a lake without surface water flow entering or leaving), assign a dilution weight based on the average annual ground water flow into the lake, if available, using the dilution weight for the corresponding river flow rate in table 4-13. If not available, assign a default dilution weight of 1.
• For the ocean and the Great Lakes, assign a dilution weight based on depth.
• For coastal tidal waters, assign a dilution weight of 0.0001; do not consider depth or flow.
• For a quiet-flowing river that has average annual flow of 10 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater and that contains the probable point of entry to surface water, apply a zone of mixing in assigning the dilution weight:
-Start the zone of mixing at the probable point of entry and extend it for 3 miles from the probable point of entry, except: if the surface water characteristics change to turbulent within this 3-mile distance, extend the zone of mixing only to the point at which the change occurs.
-Assign a dilution weight of 0.5 to any intake that lies within this zone of mixing.
-Beyond this zone of mixing, assign a dilution weight the same as for any other river (that is, assign the dilution weight based on average annual flow).
-Treat a quiet-flowing river with an average annual flow of less than 10 cfs the same as any other river (that is, assign it a dilution weight of 1).
In those cases where water flows from a surface water body with a lower assigned dilution weight (from table 4-13) to a surface water body with a higher assigned dilution weight (that is, water flows from a surface water body with more dilution to one with less dilution), use the lower assigned dilution weight as the dilution weight for the latter surface water body.
4.1.2.3.2
Population.
In evaluating the population factor, include only persons served by drinking water drawn from intakes that are along the overland/flood hazardous substance migration path for the watershed and that are within the target distance limit specified in section 4.1.1.2. Include residents, students, and workers who regularly use the water. Exclude transient populations such as customers and travelers passing through the area. When a standby intake is maintained on a regular basis so that water can be withdrawn, include it in evaluating the population factor.
In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.
In estimating the population served by an intake, if the water from the intake is blended with other water (for example, water from other surface water intakes or ground water wells), apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system to the intake based on the intake's relative contribution to the total blended system. In estimating the intake's relative contribution, assume each well or intake contributes equally and apportion the population accordingly, except: if the relative contribution of any one intake or well exceeds 40 percent based on average annual pumpage or capacity, estimate the relative contribution of the wells and intakes considering the following data, if available:
• Average annual pumpage from the ground water wells and surface water intakes in the blended system.
• Capacities of the wells and intakes in the blended system.
For systems with standby surface water intakes or standby ground water wells, apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system as described above, except:
• Exclude standby ground water wells in apportioning the population.
• When using pumpage data for a standby surface water intake, use average pumpage for the period during which the standby intake is used rather than average annual pumpage.
• For that portion of the total population that could be apportioned to a standby surface water intake, assign that portion of the population either to that standby intake or to the other surface water intake(s) and ground water well(s) that serve that population; do not assign that portion of the population both to the standby intake and to the other intake(s) and well(s) in the blended system. Use the apportioning that results in the highest population factor value. (Either include all standby intake(s) or exclude some or all of the standby intake(s) as appropriate to obtain this highest value.) Note that the specific standby intake(s) included or excluded and, thus, the specific apportioning may vary in evaluating different watersheds and in evaluating the ground water pathway.
4.1.2.3.2.1
Level of contamination.
Evaluate the population factor based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Determine which factor applies for an intake as specified in section 4.1.2.3. Evaluate intakes subject to Level I concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.2, intakes subject to Level II concentration as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.3, and intakes subject to potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.4.
For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
4.1.2.3.2.2
Level I concentrations.
Sum the number of people served by drinking water from intakes subject to Level I concentrations. Multiply this sum by 10. Assign this product as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.3.2.3
Level II concentrations.
Sum the number of people served by drinking water from intakes subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include people already counted under the Level I concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.3.2.4
Potential contamination.
For each applicable type of surface water body in table 4-14, first determine the number of people served by drinking water from intakes subject to potential contamination in that type of surface water body. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations factors.

Round the number of people to nearest integer. Do not round the assigned dilution-weighted population value to nearest integer.
b
Treat each lake as a separate type of water body and assign it a dilution-weighted population value using the surface water body type with the same dilution-weighted from table 4-13 as the lake. If drinking water is withdrawn from coastal tidal water or the ocean, assign a dilution-weighted population value to it using the surface water body type with the same dilution weight from table 4-13 as the coastal tidal water or the ocean zone.
For each type of surface water body, assign a dilution-weighted population value from table 4-14, based on the number of people included for that type of surface water body. (Note that the dilution-weighted population values in table 4-14 incorporate the dilution weights from table 4-13. Do not multiply the values from table 4-14 by these dilution weights.)
Calculate the value for the potential contamination factor (PC) for the watershed as follows:
EC15NO91.150
where:
W
i
= Dilution-weighted population from table 4-14 for surface water body type i.
n = Number of different surface water body types in the watershed.
If PC is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PC is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value for the potential contamination factor in table 4-1.
4.1.2.3.2.5
Calculation of population factor value.
Sum the factor values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the population factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.3.3
Resources.
To evaluate the resources factor for the watershed, select the highest value below that applies to the watershed. Assign this value as the resources factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
Assign a value of 5 if, within the in-water segment of the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed, the surface water is used for one or more of the following purposes:
• Irrigation (5 acre minimum) of commercial food crops or commercial forage crops.
• Watering of commercial livestock.
• Ingredient in commercial food preparation.
• Major or designated water recreation area, excluding drinking water use.
Assign a value of 5 if, within the in-water segment of the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed, the surface water is not used for drinking water, but either of the following applies:
• Any portion of the surface water is designated by a State for drinking water use under section 305(a) of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
• Any portion of the surface water is usable for drinking water purposes.
Assign a value of 0 if none of the above applies.
4.1.2.3.4
Calculation of drinking water threat-targets factor category value.
Sum the nearest intake, population, and resources factor values for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the drinking water threat-targets factor category value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.2.4
Calculation of the drinking water threat score for a watershed.
Multiply the drinking water threat factor category values for likelihood of release, waste char-
acteristics, and targets for the watershed, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 100, as the drinking water threat score for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3
Human food chain threat.
Evaluate the human food chain threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.
4.1.3.1
Human food chain threat-likelihood of release.
Assign the same likelihood of release factor category value for the human food chain threat for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.1.3 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.2
Human food chain threat-waste characteristics.
Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.
4.1.3.2.1
Toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation.
Evaluate all those hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for toxicity/persistence in the drinking water threat for the watershed (see section 4.1.2.2).
4.1.3.2.1.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
4.1.3.2.1.2
Persistence.
Assign a persistence factor value to each hazardous substance as specified for the drinking water threat (see section 4.1.2.2.1.2), except: use the predominant water category (that is, lakes; or rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes) between the probable point of entry and the nearest fishery (not the nearest drinking water or resources intake) along the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed to determine which portion of table 4-10 to use. Determine the predominant water category based on distance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2. For contaminated sediments with no identified source, use the point where measurement begins rather than the probable point of entry.
4.1.3.2.1.3
Bioaccumulation potential.
Use the following data hierarchy to assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to each hazardous substance:
• Bioconcentration factor (BCF) data.
• Logarithm of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log K
ow
) data.
• Water solubility data.
Assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to each hazardous substance from table 4-15.
If BCF data are available for any aquatic human food chain organism for the substance being evaluated, assign the bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance as follows:
• If BCF data are available for both fresh water and salt water for the hazardous substance, use the BCF data that correspond to the type of water body (that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the fisheries are located to assign the bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance.
• If, however, some of the fisheries being evaluated are in fresh water and some are in salt water, or if any are in brackish water, use the BCF data that yield the higher factor value to assign the bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance.
• If BCF data are available for either fresh water or salt water, but not for both, use the available BCF data to assign the bioaccumulation potential factor value to the hazardous substance.
If BCF data are not available for the hazardous substance, use log K
ow
data to assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value to organic substances, but not to inorganic substances. If BCF data are not available, and if either log K
ow
data are not available, the log K
ow
is available but exceeds 6.0, or the substance is an inorganic substance, use water solubility data to assign a bioaccumulation potential factor value.

b
See text for use of freshwater and saltwater BCF data.
Do not distinguish between fresh water and salt water in assigning the bioaccumulation potential factor value based on log K
ow
or water solubility data.
If none of these data are available, assign the hazardous substance a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 0.5.
4.1.3.2.1.4
Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value.
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from table 4-12, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from table 4-16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in table 4-1.

Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign the same factor value for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.2.3
Calculation of human food chain threat-waste characteristics factor category value.
For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply the toxicity/persistence factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
8
. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
12
. Based on this second product, assign a value from Table ­2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat-waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.3
Human food chain threat-targets.
Evaluate two target factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For both factors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to actual or potential human food chain contamination.
Consider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target distance limit of the watershed to be subject to actual human food chain contamination if any of the following apply:
• A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater is present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a surface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry and the most distant sampling point establishing the observed release).
• The fishery is closed, and a hazardous substance for which the fishery has been closed has been documented in an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release.
• A hazardous substance is present in a tissue sample from an essentially sessile, benthic, human food chain organism from the watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release.
For a fishery that meets any of these three criteria, but that is not wholly within the boundaries of the observed release, consider only the portion of the fishery that is within the boundaries of the observed release to be subject to actual human food chain contamination. Consider the remainder of the fishery within the target distance limit to be subject to potential food chain contamination.
In addition, consider all other fisheries that are partially or wholly within the target distance limit for the watershed, including fisheries partially or wholly within the boundaries of an observed release for the watershed that do not meet any of the three criteria listed above, to be subject to potential human food chain contamination. If only a portion of the fishery is within the target distance limit for the watershed, include only that portion in evaluating the targets factor category.
When a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food chain contamination, determine the part of the fishery subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the actual food chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it using Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination is based on samples
from the watershed, use these samples and, if available, additional tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations:
• Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from essentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain contamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these samples (or comparable samples) to the health-based benchmarks from table 4-17, as described in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for actual contamination of the fishery.
• In addition, determine the level of actual contamination from other tissue samples by comparing the concentrations of hazardous substances in the tissue samples (or comparable tissue samples) to the health-based benchmarks from table 4-17, as described in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only those additional tissue samples and only those hazardous substances in the tissue samples that meet all the following criteria:
-The tissue sample is from a location that is within the boundaries of the actual food chain contamination for the site (that is, either at the point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry and the most distant sample point meeting the criteria for actual food chain contamination).
-The tissue sample is from a species of aquatic human food chain organism that spends extended periods of time within the boundaries of the actual food chain contamination for the site and that is not an essentially sessile, benthic organism.
-The hazardous substance is a substance that is also present in a surface water, benthic, or sediment sample from within the target distance limit for the watershed and, for such a sample, meets the criteria for actual food chain contamination.

# Table 4-17—Health-Based Benchmarks for Hazardous Substances in Human Food Chain
• Concentration corresponding to Food and Drug Administration Action Level (FDAAL) for fish or shellfish.
• Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10
−6
individual cancer risk for oral exposures.
• Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological responses corresponding to the Reference Dose (RfD) for oral exposures.
4.1.3.3.1
Food chain individual.
Evaluate the food chain individual factor based on the fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the target distance limit for the watershed. Assign this factor a value as follows:
• If any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to Level I concentrations, assign a value of 50.
• If not, but if any fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.
• If not, but if there is an observed release of a hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater to surface water in the watershed and there is a fishery (or portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the target distance limit, assign a value of 20.
• If there is no observed release to surface water in the watershed or there is no observed release of a hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater, but there is a fishery (or portion of a fishery) present anywhere within the target distance limit, assign a value as follows:
-Using table 4-13, determine the highest dilution weight (that is, lowest amount of dilution) applicable to the fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the target distance limit. Multiply this dilution weight by 20 and round to the nearest integer.
-Assign this calculated value as the factor value.
• If there are no fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the target distance limit of the watershed, assign a value of 0.
Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
4.1.3.3.2
Population.
Evaluate the population factor for the watershed based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential human food chain contamination. Determine which factor applies for a fishery (or portion of a fishery) as specified in section 4.1.3.3.
4.1.3.3.2.1
Level I concentrations.
Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level I concentrations.
Estimate the human food chain population value for each fishery (or portion of a fishery) as follows:
• Estimate human food chain production for the fishery based on the estimated annual production (in pounds) of human food chain organisms (for example, fish, shellfish) for that fishery, except: if the fishery is closed and a hazardous substance for which the fishery has been closed has been documented in an observed release to the fishery from a source at the site, use the estimated annual production for the period prior to closure of the fishery or use the estimated annual production from comparable fisheries that are not closed.
• Assign the fishery a value for human food chain population from table 4-18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery.
• Set boundaries between fisheries at those points where human food chain production changes or where the surface water dilution weight changes.
Sum the human food chain population value for each fishery (and portion of a fishery). Multiply this sum by 10. If the product is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Assign the resulting value as the Level I concentrations factor value. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.3.2.2
Level II concentrations.
Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the Level I concentrations factor.
Assign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table 4-18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food chain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.
Sum the human food chain population value for each fishery (and portion of a fishery). If this sum is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Assign the resulting value as the Level II concentrations factor value. Enter this value in table 4-1.

Potential human food chain contamination.
Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to potential human food chain contamination. Do not include those fisheries (or portion of fisheries) already counted under the Level I or Level II concentrations factors.
Calculate the value for the potential human food chain contamination factor (PF) for the watershed as follows:
EC15NO91.151
where:
P
i
= Human food chain population value for fishery i.
D
i
= Dilution weight from table 4-13 for fishery i.
n = Number of fisheries subject to potential human food chain contamination.
In calculating PF:
• Estimate the human food chain population value (P

) for a fishery (or portion of a fishery) as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.
• Assign the fishery (or portion of a fishery) a dilution weight as indicated in table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1), except: do not assign a dilution weight of 0.5 for a “3-mile mixing zone in quiet flowing river”; instead assign a dilution weight based on the average annual flow.
If PF is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PF is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
4.1.3.3.2.4
Calculation of population factor value.
Sum the values for the Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential human food chain contamination factors for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign it as the population factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.3.3
Calculation of human food chain threat-targets factor category value.
Sum the food chain individual and population factor values for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign it as the human food chain threat-targets factor category value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.3.4
Calculation of human food chain threat score for a watershed.
Multiply the human food chain threat factor category values for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the watershed, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 100, as the human food chain threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in table 4-1.
4.1.4
Environmental threat.
Evaluate the environmental threat for the watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.
4.1.4.1
Environmental threat-likelihood of release.
Assign the same likelihood of release factor category value for the environmental threat for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.1.3 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.4.2
Environmental threat-waste characteristics.
Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.
4.1.4.2.1
Ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation.
Evaluate all those hazardous
substances eligible to be evaluated for toxicity/persistence in the drinking water threat for the watershed (see section 4.1.2.2).
4.1.4.2.1.1
Ecosystem toxicity.
Assign an ecosystem toxicity factor value from Table 4-19 to each hazardous substance on the basis of the following data hierarchy:
• EPA chronic Ambient Water Quality Criterion (AWQC) for the substance.
• EPA chronic Ambient Aquatic Life Advisory Concentrations (AALAC) for the substance.
• EPA acute AWQC for the substance.
• EPA acute AALAC for the substance.
• Lowest LC
50
value for the substance.
In assigning the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance:
• If either an EPA chronic AWQC or AALAC is available for the hazardous substance, use it to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value. Use the chronic AWQC in preference to the chronic AALAC when both are available.
• If neither is available, use the EPA acute AWQC or AALAC to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value. Use the acute AWQC in preference to the acute AALAC.
• If none of the chronic and acute AWQCs and AALACs is available, use the lowest LC
50
value to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value.
• If an LC
50
value is also not available, assign an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0 to the hazardous substance and use other hazardous substances for which data are available in evaluating the pathway.
If an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0 is assigned to all hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated for the watershed (that is, insufficient data are available for evaluating all the substances), use a default value of 100 as the ecosystem toxicity factor value for all these hazardous substances.
With regard to the AWQC, AALAC, or LC
50
selected for assigning the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance:
• If values for the selected AWQC, AALAC, or LC
50
are available for both fresh water and marine water for the hazardous substance, use the value that corresponds to the type of water body (that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the sensitive environments are located to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance.
• If, however, some of the sensitive environments being evaluated are in fresh water and some are in salt water, or if any are in brackish water, use the value (fresh water or marine) that yields the higher factor value to assign the ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance.
• If a value for the selected AWQC, AALAC, or LC
50
is available for either fresh water or marine water, but not for both, use the available one to assign an ecosystem toxicity factor value to the hazardous substance.

4.1.4.2.1.2
Persistence.
Assign a persistence factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2, except: use the predominant water category (that is lakes; or rivers, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes) between the probable point of entry and the nearest sensitive environment (not the nearest drinking water or resources intake) along the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed to determine which portion of table 4-10 to use. Determine the predominant water category based on distance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2. For contaminated sediments with no identified source, use the point where measurement begins rather than the probable point of entry.
4.1.4.2.1.3
Ecosystem bioaccumulation potential.
Assign an ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value to each hazardous substance in the same manner specified for the bioaccumulation potential factor in section 4.1.3.2.1.3, except:
• Use BCF data for all aquatic organisms, not just for aquatic human food chain organisms.
• Use the BCF data that corresponds to the type of water body (that is, fresh water or salt water) in which the sensitive environments (not fisheries) are located.
4.1.4.2.1.4
Calculation of ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value.
Assign each hazardous substance an ecosystem toxicity/persistence factor value from table 4-20, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the ecosystem toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance an ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from table ­4-21, based on the values assigned for the ecosystem toxicity/persistence and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factors. Select the hazardous substance with the highest ecosystem toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed and use it to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in table 4-1.

Assign the same factor value for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.4.2.3
Calculation of environmental threat-waste characteristics factor category value.
For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.4.2.1.4, use its ecosystem toxicity/persistence factor value and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply the ecosystem toxicity/persistence factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
8
. Then multiply this product by the ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10

Environmental threat-targets.
Evaluate the environmental threat-targets factor category for a watershed using one factor: sensitive environments.
4.1.4.3.1
Sensitive environments.
Evaluate sensitive environments along the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination.
Determine which factor applies to each sensitive environment as specified in section 4.1.2.3, except: use ecological-based benchmarks (Table 4-22) rather than health-based benchmarks (Table 3-10) in determining the level of contamination from samples. In determining the level of actual contamination, use a point of direct observation anywhere within the sensitive environment or samples (that is, surface water, benthic, or sediment samples) taken anywhere within or beyond the sensitive environment (or anywhere adjacent to or beyond the sensitive environment if it is contiguous to the migration path).
4.1.4.3.1.1
Level I concentrations.
Assign value(s) from table 4-23 to each sensitive environment subject to Level I concentrations.
For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 4-24. In assigning a value from table 4-24, include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous substance migration path in the area of Level I concentrations. If a wetland is located partially along the area of Level I concentrations and partially along the area of Level II concentrations and/or potential contamination, then solely for purposes of table 4-24, count the portion(s) along the areas of Level II concentrations or potential contamination under the Level II concentrations factor (section 4.1.4.3.1.2) or potential contamination factor (section 4.1.4.3.1.3), as appropriate.
Estimate the total length of wetlands along the hazardous substance migration path (that is, wetland frontage) in the area of Level I concentrations and assign a value from table 4-24 based on this total length. Estimate this length as follows:
• For an isolated wetland or for a wetland where the probable point of entry to surface water is in the wetland, use the perimeter of that portion of the wetland subject to Level I concentrations as the length.
• For rivers, use the length of the wetlands contiguous to the in-water segment of the hazardous substance migration path (that is, wetland frontage).
• For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, and Great Lakes, use the length of the wetlands along the shoreline within the target distance limit (that is, wetland frontage along the shoreline).
Calculate the Level I concentrations factor value (SH) for the watershed as follows:
EC15NO91.152
where:
WH = Value assigned from table 4-24 to wetlands along the area of Level I concentrations.

Level II concentrations.
Assign value(s) from table 4-23 to each sensitive environment subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include sensitive environments already counted for table 4-23 under the Level I concentrations factor for this watershed.
For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 4-24. In assigning a value from table 4-24, include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous substance migration path in the area of Level II concentrations, as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1.
Estimate the total length of wetlands along the hazardous substance migration path (that is, wetland frontage) in the area of Level II concentrations and assign a value from table 4-24 based on this total length. Estimate this length as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1, except: for an isolated wetland or for a wetland where the probable point of entry to surface water is in the wetland, use the perimeter of that portion of the wetland subject to Level II (not Level I) concentrations as the length.
Calculate the Level II concentrations value (SL) for the watershed as follows:

where:
WL = Value assigned from table 4-24 to wetlands along the area of Level II concentrations.
S
i
= Value(s) assigned from table 4-23 to sensitive environment i.

Enter the value assigned in table 4-1.
4.1.4.3.1.3
Potential contamination.
Assign value(s) from table 4-23 to each sensitive environment subject to potential contamination. Do not include sensitive environments already counted for table 4-23 under the Level I or Level II concentrations factors.
For each type of surface water body in table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1), sum the value(s)
assigned from table 4-23 to the sensitive environments along that type of surface water body, except: do not use the surface water body type “3-mile mixing zone in quiet flowing river.” If a sensitive environment is along two or more types of surface water bodies (for example, Wildlife Refuge contiguous to both a moderate stream and a large river), assign the sensitive environment only to that surface water body type having the highest dilution weight value from table 4-13.
For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 4-24. In assigning a value from table 4-24, include only those portions of wetlands located along the hazardous substance migration path in the area of potential contamination, as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1. Aggregate these wetlands by type of surface water body, except: do not use the surface water body type “3-mile mixing zone in quiet flowing river.” Treat the wetlands aggregated within each type of surface water body as separate sensitive environments solely for purposes of applying table 4-24. Estimate the total length of the wetlands within each surface water body type as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1, except: for an isolated wetland or for a wetland where the probable point of entry to surface water is in the wetland, use the perimeter of that portion of the wetland subject to potential contamination (or the portion of that perimeter that is within the target distance limit) as the length. Assign a separate value from table 4-24 for each type of surface water body in the watershed.
Calculate the potential contamination factor value (SP) for the watershed as follows:
EC15NO91.154
where:

If SP is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if SP is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value for the potential contamination factor in table 4-1.
4.1.4.3.1.4
Calculation of environmental threat-targets factor category value.
Sum the values for the Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination factors for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the environmental threat-targets factor category value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.
4.1.4.4
Calculation of environmental threat score for a watershed.
Multiply the environmental threat factor category values for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the watershed, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 60, as the environmental threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in table 4-1.
4.1.5
Calculation of overland/flood migration component score for a watershed.
Sum the scores for the three threats for the watershed (that is, drinking water, human food chain, and environmental threats). Assign the resulting score, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the surface water overland/flood migration component score for the watershed. Enter this score in table 4-1.
4.1.6
Calculation of overland/flood migration component score.
Select the highest surface water overland/flood migration component score from the watersheds evaluated. Assign this score as the surface water overland/flood migration component score for the site, subject to a maximum score of 100. Enter this score in table 4-1.
4.2
Ground water to surface water migration component.
Use the ground water to surface water migration component to evaluate surface water threats that result from migration of hazardous substances from a source at the site to surface water via ground water. Evaluate three types of threats for this component: drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat.
4.2.1
General considerations.
4.2.1.1
Eligible surface waters.
Calculate ground water to surface water migration component scores only for surface waters (see section 4.0.2) for which all the following conditions are met:
• A portion of the surface water is within 1 mile of one or more sources at the site having a containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 4.2.2.1.2).
• No aquifer discontinuity is established between the source and the portion of the surface water within 1 mile of the source (see section 3.0.1.2.2). However, if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity within this 1 mile distance, do not consider a discontinuity present in scoring the site.
• The top of the uppermost aquifer is at or above the bottom of the surface water.
Do not evaluate this component for sites consisting solely of contaminated sediments with no identified source.
4.2.1.2
Definition of hazardous substance migration path for ground water to surface water migration component.
The hazardous substance migration path includes both the ground water segment and the surface water in-water segment that hazardous substances would take as they migrate away from sources at the site:
• Restrict the ground water segment to migration via the uppermost aquifer between a source and the surface water.
• Begin the surface water in-water segment at the probable point of entry from the uppermost aquifer to the surface water. Identify the probable point of entry as that point of the surface water that yields the shortest straight-line distance, within the aquifer boundary (see section 3.0.1.2), from the sources at the site with a containment factor value greater than 0 to the surface water.
-For rivers, continue the in-water segment in the direction of flow (including any tidal flows) for the distance established by the target distance limit (see section 4.2.1.4).
-For lakes, oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes, do not consider flow direction. Instead apply the target distance limit as an arc.
-If the in-water segment includes both rivers and lakes (or oceans, coastal tidal waters, or Great Lakes), apply the target distance limit to their combined in-water segments.
Consider a site to be in two or more watersheds for this component if two or more hazardous substance migration paths from the sources at the site do not reach a common point within the target distance limit. If the site is in more than one watershed, define a separate hazardous substance migration path for each watershed. Evaluate the ground water to surface water migration component for each watershed separately as specified in section 4.2.1.5.
4.2.1.3
Observed release of a specific hazardous substance to surface water in-water segment.
Section 4.2.2.1.1 specifies the criteria for assigning values to the observed release factor for the ground water to surface water migration component. With regard to an individual hazardous substance, consider an observed release of that hazardous substance to be established for the surface water in-water segment of the ground water to surface water migration component only when the hazardous substance meets the criteria both for an observed release both to ground water (see section 4.2.2.1.1) and for an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water (see section 4.1.2.1.1).
If the hazardous substance meets the section 4.1.2.1.1 criteria for an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water but does not also meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water, do not use any samples of that hazardous substance from the surface water in-water segment in evaluating the factors of this component (for example, do not use the hazardous substance in establishing targets subject to actual contamination or in determining the level of actual contamination for a target).
4.2.1.4
Target distance limit.
Determine the target distance limit for each watershed as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not extend the target distance limit to a sample location beyond 15 miles unless at least one hazardous substance in a sample from that location meets the criteria in section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the surface water in-water segment.
Determine the targets eligible to be evaluated for each watershed and establish whether these targets are subject to actual or potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, except: do not establish actual contamination based on a sample location unless at least one hazardous substance in a sample from that location meets the criteria in section 4.2.1.3 for an observed release to the surface water in-water segment.
4.2.1.5
Evaluation of ground water to surface water migration component.
Evaluate the drinking water threat, human food chain threat, and environmental threat for each watershed for this component based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. Figure 4-2 indicates the factors included within each factor category for each type of threat.
EC02AU92.009
Determine the ground water to surface water migration component score (S
gs
) for a watershed in terms of the factor category values as follows:
EC15NO91.156
where:
LR
i
= Likelihood of release factor category value for threat i (that is, drinking water, human food chain, or environmental threat).
WC
i
= Waste characteristics factor category value for threat i.
T
i
= Targets factor category value for threat i.
SF = Scaling factor.
Table 4-25 outlines the specific calculation procedure.
If the site is in only one watershed, assign the ground water to surface water migration component score for that watershed as the ground water to surface water migration component score for the site.
If the site is in more than one watershed:
• Calculate a separate ground water to surface water migration component score for each watershed, using likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets applicable to each watershed.
• Select the highest ground water to surface water migration component score from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the ground water to surface water migration component score for the site.

4.2.2
Drinking water threat.
Evaluate the drinking water threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.
4.2.2.1
Drinking water threat-likelihood of release.
Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
4.2.2.1.1
Observed release.
Establish an observed release to the uppermost aquifer as specified in section 3.1.1. If an observed release can be established for the uppermost aquifer, assign an observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-25, and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.3. If no observed release can be established, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 4-25, and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.2.
4.2.2.1.2
Potential to release.
Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the uppermost aquifer. Calculate a potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as specified in section 3.1.2 and sections 3.1.2.1 through 3.1.2.5. Assign the potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as the potential to release factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.2.1.3
Calculation of drinking water threat-likelihood of release factor category value.
If an observed release is established for the uppermost aquifer, assign the observed release factor value of 550 as the likelihood of release factor category value for the watershed. Otherwise, assign the potential to release factor value as the likelihood of release factor category value for the watershed. Enter the value assigned in table 4-25.
4.2.2.2
Drinking water threat-waste characteristics.
Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/mobility/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the uppermost aquifer (see section 3.2). Such hazardous substances include:
• Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water.
• All hazardous substances associated with a source that has a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 3.1.2.1).
4.2.2.2.1
Toxicity/mobility/persistence.
For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, a persistence factor value, and a combined toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value as specified in sections 4.2.2.2.1.1 through 4.2.2.2.1.4.
4.2.2.2.1.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
4.2.2.2.1.2
Mobility.
Assign a ground water mobility factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 3.2.1.2.
4.2.2.2.1.3
Persistence.
Assign a surface water persistence factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2.
4.2.2.2.1.4
Calculation of toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value.
First, assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from table 3-9 (section 3.2.1.3), based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility/persistence factor
value from table 4-26, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/mobility and persistence factors. Use the substance with the highest toxicity/mobility/ persistence factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.2.2.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign the same factor value for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned for the uppermost aquifer in section 3.2.2. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.2.2.3
Calculation of drinking water threat-waste characteristics factor category value.
Multiply the toxicity/mobility/persistence and hazardous waste quantity factor values for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
8
. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the drinking water threat-waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.2.3
Drinking water threat-targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category for each watershed based on three factors: nearest intake, population, and resources.

Do not round to nearest integer.
For the nearest intake and population factors, determine whether the target surface water intakes are subject to actual or potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, subject to the restrictions specified in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
When the intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. Determine which level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure concentrations from a sample (or comparable samples) to health-based benchmarks as specified in section 4.1.2.3, except use only those samples from the surface water in-water segment and only those hazardous substances in such samples that meet the conditions in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
4.2.2.3.1
Nearest intake.
Assign a value to the nearest intake factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.1 with the following modification. For the intake being evaluated, multiply its dilution weight from table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1) by a value selected from table 4-27. Use the resulting product, not the value from table 4-13, as the dilution weight for the intake for the ground water to surface water component. Do not round this product to the nearest integer.
Select the value from table 4-27 based on the angle Θ, the angle defined by the sources at the site and either the two points at the intersection of the surface water body and the 1-mile distance ring of any two other points of the surface water body within the 1-mile distance ring, whichever results in the largest angle. (See Figure 4-3 for an example of how to determine Θ.) If the surface water body does not extend to the 1-mile ring at one or both ends, define Θ using the surface water endpoint(s) within the 1-mile ring or any two other points of the surface water body within the 1-mile distance ring, whichever results in the largest angle.

4.2.4.2.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign the same factor value for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.2.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.4.2.3
Calculation of environmental threat-waste characteristics factor category value.
For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.2.4.2.1.5, use its ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value and ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply the ecosystem toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
8
. Then multiply this product by the ecosystem bioaccumulation potential factor value for this hazardous substance, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
12
. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the environmental threat-waste characteristics category for the watershed. Enter the value in table 4-25.
4.2.4.3
Environmental threat-targets.
Evaluate the environmental threat-targets factor category for a watershed using one factor: sensitive environments.
4.2.4.3.1
Sensitive environments.
Evaluate sensitive environments for the watershed based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Determine which applies to each sensitive environment as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1, except: use only those samples from the surface water in-water segment and only those hazardous substances in such samples that meet the conditions in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.
4.2.4.3.1.1
Level I concentrations.
Assign a value to this factor as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.1. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.4.3.1.2
Level II concentrations.
Assign a value to this factor as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.2. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.4.3.1.3
Potential contamination.
Assign a value to this factor as specified in section 4.1.4.3.1.3 with the following modification. Multiply the appropriate dilution weight from table 4-13 for the sensitive environments in each type of surface water body by the adjustment value selected from table 4-27, as specified in section 4.2.2.3.1. Use the resulting product, not the value from table 4-13, as the dilution weight for the sensitive environments in that type of surface water body. Do not round this product to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in table 4-25.
4.2.4.3.1.4
Calculation of environmental threat-targets factor category value.
Sum the values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination for the watershed. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the environmental threat targets factor category value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.
4.2.4.4
Calculation of environmental threat score for a watershed.
Multiply the environmental threat factor category values for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets for the watershed, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum of 60, as the environmental threat score for the watershed. Enter this score in table 4-25.
4.2.5
Calculation of ground water to surface water migration component score for a watershed.
Sum the scores for the three threats for the watershed (that is, drinking water, human food chain, and environmental threats). Assign the resulting score, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the ground water to surface water migration component score for the watershed. Enter this score in table 4-25.
4.2.6
Calculation of ground water to surface water migration component score.
Select the highest ground water to surface water migration component score from the watersheds evaluated. Assign this score as the ground water to surface water migration component score for the site, subject to a maximum score of 100. Enter this score in table 4-25.
4.3
Calculation of surface water migration pathway score.
Determine the surface water migration pathway score as follows:
• If only one of the two surface water migration components (overland/flood or ground water to surface water) is scored, assign the score of that component as the surface water migration pathway score.
• If both components are scored, select the higher of the two component scores from sections 4.1.6 and 4.2.6. Assign that score as the surface water migration pathway score.

# 5.0 Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway
5.0.1
Exposure components.
Evaluate the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on two exposure components:
• Soil exposure component (see section 5.1).
• Subsurface intrusion component (see section 5.2).
Score one or both components considering their relative importance. If only one component is scored, assign its score as the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score. If both components are scored, sum the two scores and assign it as the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, subject to a maximum of 100.

5.1.0
General considerations.
Evaluate the soil exposure component based on areas of observed contamination:
• Consider observed contamination to be present at sampling locations where analytic evidence indicates that:
—A hazardous substance attributable to the site is present at a concentration significantly above background levels for the site (see Table 2-3 in section 2.3 for the criteria for determining analytical significance),
and
—This hazardous substance, if not present at the surface, is covered by 2 feet or less of cover material (for example, soil).
• Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling locations at which there is observed contamination as follows:
—For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is present at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an area of observed contamination.
—For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed contamination from the site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of observed contamination, unless available information indicates otherwise.
• If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, or otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not more than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil exposure component.
• For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in evaluating the soil exposure component (see section 2.2.2).
If there is observed contamination, assign scores for the resident population threat and the nearby population threat, as specified in sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2. If there is no observed contamination, assign the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway a score of 0.
5.1.1
Resident population threat.
Evaluate the resident population threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more of the following locations:
• Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day care center
and
within 200 feet of the respective residence, school, or day care center, or
• Within a workplace property boundary
and
within 200 feet of a workplace area, or
• Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 5.1.1.3.4, or
• Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive environment specified in section 5.1.1.3.5.
If not, assign the resident population threat a value of 0, enter this value in Table 5-1, and proceed to the nearby population threat (section 5.1.2).
5.1.1.1
Likelihood of exposure.
Assign a value of 550 to the likelihood of exposure factor category for the resident population threat if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more locations listed in section 5.1.1. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
5.1.1.2
Waste characteristics.
Evaluate waste characteristics based on two factors: toxicity and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination at the site (see section 5.1.0).
5.1.1.2.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity factor value to assign the value to the toxicity factor for the resident population threat. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
5.1.1.2.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign a hazardous waste quantity factor value as specified in section 2.4.2. In estimating the hazardous waste quantity, use Table 5-2 and:
• Consider only the first 2 feet of depth of an area of observed contamination, except as specified for the volume measure.
• Use the volume measure (see section 2.4.2.1.3) only for those types of areas of observed contamination listed in Tier C of Table 5-2. In evaluating the volume measure for these listed areas of observed contamination, use the full volume, not just the volume within the top 2 feet.
• Use the area measure (see section 2.4.2.1.4), not the volume measure, for all other types of areas of observed contamination, even if their volume is known.
Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.

8
. Based on this product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
5.1.1.3
Targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category for the resident population threat based on five factors: Resident individual, resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive environments.
In evaluating the targets factor category for the resident population threat, count only the following as targets:
• Resident individual—a person living or attending school or day care on a property with an area of observed contamination
and
whose residence, school, or day care center, respectively, is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.
• Worker—a person working on a property with an area of observed contamination
and
whose workplace area is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.
• Resources located on an area of observed contamination, as specified in section 5.1.1.
• Terrestrial sensitive environments located on an area of observed contamination, as specified in section 5.1.1.
5.1.1.3.1
Resident individual.
Evaluate this factor based on whether there is a resident individual, as specified in section 5.1.1.3, who is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations.
First, determine those areas of observed contamination subject to Level I concentrations and those subject to Level II concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-3 in determining the level of contamination. Then assign a value to the resident individual factor as follows:
• Assign a value of 50 if there is at least one resident individual for one or more areas subject to Level I concentrations.
• Assign a value of 45 if there is no such resident individuals, but there is at least one resident individual for one or more areas subject to Level II concentrations.
• Assign a value of 0 if there is no resident individual.
Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.
5.1.1.3.2
Resident population.
Evaluate resident population based on two factors: Level I concentrations and Level II concentrations. Determine which factor applies as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, using the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-3. Evaluate populations subject to Level I concentrations as specified in section 5.1.1.3.2.1 and populations subject to Level II concentrations as specified in section 5.1.1.3.2.2.

• Assign a value of 0 if none of the above are present.
Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.
5.1.1.3.5

5.1.2.2
Waste characteristics.
Evaluate waste characteristics based on two factors: toxicity and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria for observed contamination (see section 5.1.0) at areas that can be assigned an attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0.
5.1.2.2.1
Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value as specified in section 2.4.1.1 to each hazardous substance meeting the criteria in section 5.1.2.2. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity factor value to assign the value to the toxicity factor for the nearby population threat. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
5.1.2.2.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign a value to the hazardous waste quantity factor as specified in section 5.1.1.2.2, except: consider only those areas of observed contamination that can be assigned an attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0. Enter the value assigned in Table 5-1.
5.1.2.2.3
Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value.
Multiply the toxicity and hazardous waste quantity factor values, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10

. Based on this product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
5.1.2.3
Targets.
Evaluate the targets factory category for the nearby population threat based on two factors: nearby individual and population within a 1-mile travel distance from the site.
5.1.2.3.1
Nearby individual.
If one or more persons meet the section 5.1.1.3 criteria for a resident individual, assign this factor a value of 0. Enter this value in Table 5-1.
If no person meets the criteria for a resident individual, determine the shortest travel distance from the site to any residence or school. In determining the travel distance, measure the shortest overland distance an individual would travel from a residence or school to the nearest area of observed contamination for the site with an attractiveness/accessibility factor value greater than 0. If there are no natural barriers to travel, measure the travel distance as the shortest straight-line distance from the residence or school to the area of observed contamination. If natural barriers exist (for example, a river), measure the travel distance as the shortest straight-line distance from the residence or school to the nearest crossing point and from there as the shortest straight-line distance to the area of observed contamination. Based on the shortest travel distance, assign a value from Table 5-9 to the nearest individual factor. Enter this value in Table 5-1.

Determine the population within each travel distance category of Table 5-10. Count residents and students who attend school within this travel distance. Do not include those people already counted in the resident population threat. Determine travel distances as specified in section 5.1.2.3.1.
In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.
Based on the number of people included within a travel distance category, assign a distance-weighted population value for that travel distance from Table 5-10.
Calculate the value for the population within 1 mile factor (PN) as follows:

Calculation of nearby population targets factor category value.
Sum the values for the nearby individual factor and the population within 1 mile factor. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the targets factor category value for the nearby population threat. Enter this value in Table 5-1.

General considerations.
The subsurface intrusion component evaluates the threats from hazardous substances that have or could intrude into regularly occupied structures from the subsurface. Evaluate the subsurface intrusion component based on the actual or potential intrusion of hazardous substances into all regularly occupied structures that have structure containment values greater than zero and meet the criteria identified in the section below as being either in an area of observed exposure or in an area of subsurface contamination. These structures may or may not have subunits. Subunits are partitioned areas within a structure with separate heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems or distinctly different air exchange rates. Subunits include regularly occupied partitioned tenant spaces such as office suites, apartments, condos, common or shared areas, and portions of residential, commercial or industrial structures with separate heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
In evaluating the subsurface intrusion component, consider the following:
• Area(s) of observed exposure: An area of observed exposure is delineated by regularly occupied structures with documented contamination meeting observed exposure criteria; an area of observed exposure includes regularly occupied structures with samples meeting observed exposure criteria or inferred to be within an area of observed exposure based on samples meeting observed exposure criteria (see section 5.2.1.1.1
Observed exposure
). Establish areas of observed exposure as follows:
—For regularly occupied structures that have no subunits, consider both the regularly occupied structures containing sampling location(s) meeting observed exposure criteria for the site and the regularly occupied structure(s) in the area lying between such locations to be an area of observed exposure (
i.e.,
inferred to be in an area of observed exposure), unless available information indicates otherwise.
—In multi-story, multi-subunit, regularly occupied structures, consider all subunits on a level with sampling locations meeting observed exposure criteria from the site and all levels below, if any, to be within an area of observed exposure, unless available information indicates otherwise.
—In multi-tenant structures, that do not have a documented observed exposure, but are located in an area lying between locations where observed exposures have been documented, consider only those regularly occupied subunits, if any, on the lowest
level of the structure, to be within an area of observed exposure (
i.e.,
inferred to be in an area of observed exposure, unless available information indicates otherwise.
• Area(s) of subsurface contamination: An area of subsurface contamination is delineated by sampling locations meeting observed release criteria for subsurface intrusion, excluding areas of observed exposure (see Table 2-3 in section 2.3). The area within an area of subsurface contamination includes potentially exposed populations. If the significant increase in hazardous substance levels cannot be attributed at least in part to the site, and cannot be attributed to other sites, attribution can be established based on the presence of hazardous substances in the area of subsurface contamination. Establish areas of subsurface contamination as follows:
—Exclude those areas that contain structures meeting the criteria defined as an area of observed exposure.
—Consider both the sampling location(s) with subsurface contamination meeting observed release criteria from the site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of subsurface contamination (
i.e.,
inferred to be in an area of subsurface contamination). If sufficient data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk due to subsurface intrusion into a regularly occupied structure located within an area of subsurface contamination, that structure can be excluded from the area of subsurface contamination.
—Evaluate an area of subsurface contamination based on hazardous substances that:
▪ Meet the criteria for observed exposure of a chemical that has a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10
−

/mol.
—Evaluate all structures with no subunits that have containment factor values greater than zero, and not documented to meet observed exposure criteria to be in an area of subsurface contamination if they are lying between locations of subsurface intrusion samples meeting observed release criteria.
—Evaluate multi-subunit structures as follows:
▪ If an observed exposure has been documented based on a gaseous indoor air sample, consider all regularly occupied subunit(s), if any, on the level immediately above the level where an observed exposure has been documented (or has been inferred to be within an area of observed exposure), to be within an area of subsurface contamination. If sufficient data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk due to subsurface intrusion on the level immediately above the level where an observed exposure has been documented (or has been inferred to be within an area of observed exposure) that level can be excluded from the area of subsurface contamination.
▪ If observed release criteria have been met based on a gaseous indoor air sample collected from a level not regularly occupied, consider all regularly occupied subunit(s), if any, on the level immediately above the level where the observed release criteria has been documented, to be within an area of subsurface contamination. If sufficient data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk due to subsurface intrusion on the level immediately above the level where the observed release criteria has been documented that level can be excluded from the area of subsurface contamination.
▪ If any regularly occupied multi-subunit structure is inferred to be in an area of subsurface contamination, consider only those regularly occupied subunit(s), if any, on the lowest level, to be within an area of subsurface contamination. If sufficient data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk due to subsurface intrusion on the lowest level, that structure can be excluded from the area of subsurface contamination.
See Section 7.0 for establishing an area of subsurface contamination based on the presence of radioactive hazardous substances.
If there is no area of observed exposure and no area of subsurface contamination, assign a score of 0 for the subsurface intrusion component.
5.2.1
Subsurface intrusion component.
Evaluate this component only if there is an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination:
• Within or underlying a residence, school, day care center, workplace, or
• Within or underlying a resource specified in section 5.2.1.3.3.
5.2.1.1
Likelihood of exposure.
Assign a value of 550 to the likelihood of exposure factor category for the subsurface intrusion component if there is an area of observed exposure in one or more locations listed in section 5.2.1. Enter this value in Table 5-11.
5.2.1.1.1
Observed exposure.
Establish observed exposure in a regularly occupied structure by demonstrating that a hazardous substance has been released into a regularly occupied structure via the subsurface. Base this demonstration on either of the following criteria:
• Direct observation:
—A solid, liquid, or gaseous material that contains one or more hazardous substances attributable to the site has been observed entering a regularly occupied structure through migration via the subsurface or is known to have entered a regularly occupied structure via the subsurface, or
—When evidence supports the inference of subsurface intrusion of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances associated with the site into a regularly occupied structure, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may be used to establish observed exposure.
• Chemical analysis:
—Analysis of indoor samples indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) is significantly above the background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3).
—Some portion of the significant increase above background must be attributable to the site to establish the observed exposure. Documentation of this attribution should account for possible concentrations of the hazardous substance(s) in outdoor air or from materials found in the regularly occupied structure, and should provide a rationale for the increase being from subsurface intrusion.
If observed exposure can be established in a regularly occupied structure, assign an observed exposure factor value of 550, enter this value in Table 5-11, and proceed to section 5.2.1.1.3. If no observed exposure can be established, assign an observed exposure factor value of 0, enter this value in Table 5-11, and proceed to section 5.2.1.1.2.
5.2.1.1.2
Potential for exposure.
Evaluate potential for exposure only if an observed exposure cannot be established, but an area of subsurface contamination has been delineated. Evaluate potential for exposure based only on the presence of hazardous substances with a vapor pressure greater than or equal to one torr or a Henry's constant greater than or equal to 10
−

/mol. Evaluate potential for exposure for each area of subsurface contamination based on four factors: Structure containment (see section 5.2.1.1.2.1), depth to contamination (see section 5.2.1.1.2.2), vertical migration (see section 5.2.1.1.2.3) and vapor migration potential (see section 5.2.1.1.2.4). For each area of subsurface contamination, assign the highest value for each factor. If information is insufficient to calculate any single factor value used to calculate the potential for exposure factor values at an identified area of subsurface contamination, information collected for another area of subsurface contamination at the site may be used when evaluating potential for exposure. Calculate the potential for exposure value for the site as specified in section 5.2.1.1.2.5.
5.2.1.1.2.1
Structure containment.
Calculate containment for eligible hazardous substances within this component as directed in Table 5-12 and enter this value into Table 5-11. Assign each regularly occupied structure within an area of subsurface contamination the highest appropriate structure containment value from Table 5-12 and use the regularly occupied structure at the site with the highest structure containment value in performing the potential for exposure calculation. For all regularly occupied structures with unknown containment features assign a structure containment value of greater than zero for the purposes of evaluating targets (see section 5.2.1.3).

5.2.1.1.2.2
Depth to contamination.
Assign each area of subsurface contamination a depth to contamination based on the least depth to either contaminated crawl space or subsurface media underlying a regularly occupied structure. Measure this depth to contamination based on the distance between the lowest point of a regularly occupied structure to the highest known point of hazardous substances eligible to be evaluated. Use any regularly occupied structure within an area of subsurface contamination with a structure containment factor value greater than zero. Subtract from the depth to contamination the thickness of any subsurface layer composed of features that would allow channelized flow (
e.g.,
karst, lava tubes, open fractures, as well as manmade preferential pathways such as utility conduits or drainage systems).
Based on this calculated depth, assign a factor value from Table 5-13. If the necessary information is available at multiple locations, calculate the depth to contamination at each location. Use the location having the least depth to contamination to assign the factor value. Enter this value in Table 5-11.

5.2.1.1.2.3
Vertical migration.
Evaluate the vertical migration factor for each area of subsurface contamination based on the geologic materials in the interval between the lowest point of a regularly occupied structure and the highest known point of hazardous substances in the subsurface. Use any regularly occupied structure either within an area of subsurface contamination or overlying subsurface soil gas or ground water contamination. Assign a value to the vertical migration factor as follows:
• If the depth to contamination (see section 5.2.1.1.2.2) is 10 feet or less, assign a value of 15.
• If the depth to contamination is greater than 10 feet, do not consider layers or portions of layers within the first 10 feet of the depth to contamination (as assigned in section 5.2.1.1.2.2).
• If, for the interval between the lowest point of a regularly occupied structure and the highest point of hazardous substances in the subsurface, all layers that underlie a portion of a regularly occupied structure at the site are karst or otherwise allow channelized flow, assign a value of 15.
• Otherwise:
—Select the lowest effective porosity/permeability layer(s) from within the interval identified above. Consider only layers at least 1 foot thick.—Assign a value for individual layers from Table 5-14 using the hydraulic conductivity of the layer, if available. If the hydraulic conductivity is not available, assign a value based on the type of material in the selected layer.
—If more than one layer has the same assigned porosity/permeability value, include all such layers and sum their thicknesses. Assign a thickness of 0 feet to a layer with channelized flow features found within any area of subsurface contamination at the site.
—Assign a value from Table 5-15 to the vertical migration factor, based on the thickness and assigned porosity/permeability value of the lowest effective porosity/permeability layer(s).
Determine vertical migration only at locations within an area of subsurface contamination at the site. If the necessary subsurface geologic information is available at multiple locations, evaluate the vertical migration factor at each location. Use the location having the highest vertical migration factor value to assign the factor value. Enter this value in Table 5-11.

Vapor migration potential.
Evaluate this factor for each area of subsurface contamination as follows:
• If the depth to contamination (see section 5.2.1.1.2.2) is 10 feet or less, assign a value of 25.
• Assign a value for vapor migration potential to each of the gaseous hazardous substances associated with the area of subsurface contamination (see section 2.2.2) as follows:

5.2.1.2
Waste characteristics.
Evaluate waste characteristics based on two factors: toxicity/degradation and hazardous waste quantity.
5.2.1.2.1
Toxicity/degradation.
For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a degradation factor value and a combined toxicity/degradation factor value as specified in sections 2.2.3, 2.4.1.2 and 5.2.1.2.1.1 through 5.2.1.2.1.3.

Toxicity.
Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in sections 2.2.2 and 2.4.1.1.

Degradation.
Assign a degradation factor value to each hazardous substance as follows:
• For any hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed exposure, or if a NAPL is present in the subsurface below an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination at a depth less than or equal to 30 feet, assign that substance a degradation factor value of 1.
• For all other situations, assign a degradation factor value using Table 5-18. Assign the depth to contamination as directed in section 5.2.1.1.2.2, except if evidence indicates that biologically active soil is not present throughout the depth beneath any regularly occupied structure. In this situation, subtract any thickness of non-biologically active soil from the estimated depth to contamination.

When determining the depth to contamination do not include layers of non-biologically-active soil, nor subsurface intervals with channelized flow (
e.g.,
karst, lava tubes, open fractures, and manmade preferential pathways as directed in section 5.2.1.1.2.2).
Calculate the half-life for each hazardous substance that meets subsurface intrusion observed release criteria as follows:
The half-life of a substance in the subsurface is defined for HRS purposes as the time required to reduce the initial concentration of the substance in the subsurface by one-half as a result of the combined decay processes of two components: Biodegradation and hydrolysis.
Estimate the half-life (t
1/2
) of a hazardous substance as follows:
ER09JA17.072
Where:
h=Hydrolysis half-life.
b=Biodegradation half-life.
If either of these component half-lives cannot be estimated for the hazardous substance from available data, delete that component half-life from the above equation.
If no half-life information is available for a hazardous substance and the substance is not already assigned a value of 1, unless information indicates otherwise, assign a value of 1.
5.2.1.2.1.3
Calculation of toxicity/degradation factor value.
Assign each substance a toxicity/degradation value by multiplying the toxicity factor value by the degradation factor value. Use the hazardous substance with the highest combined toxicity/degradation value to assign the factor value to the toxicity/degradation factor for the subsurface intrusion threat. Enter this value in Table 5-11.
5.2.1.2.2
Hazardous waste quantity.
Assign a hazardous waste quantity factor value as specified in section 2.4.2. Consider only those regularly occupied structures or subunits with a non-zero structure containment value. Also include all regularly occupied structures or subunits that have had mitigation systems installed as part of a removal or other temporary response action. If sufficient structure-specific concentration data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk of exposure to populations in a regularly occupied structure or subunit in an area of subsurface contamination, that structure or subunit is not included in the hazardous waste quantity evaluation. In estimating the hazardous waste quantity, use Tables 2-5 and 5-19 and:
• For Tier A, hazardous constituent quantity, use the mass of constituents found in the regularly occupied structure(s) where the observed exposure has been identified.
—For multi-subunit structures, when calculating Tier A, use the mass of constituents found in the regularly occupied subunit space(s) where the observed exposure has been identified.
• For Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity, use the flow-through volume of the regularly occupied structures where the observed exposure has been identified.
—For multi-subunit structures, when calculating Tier B, use the flow-through volume of the regularly occupied subunit spaces where the observed exposure has been identified.
• For Tier C, volume, use the volume divisor listed in Tier C of Table 5-19. Volume is calculated for those regularly occupied structures located within areas of observed exposure with observed or inferred intrusion and within areas of subsurface contamination.
—In evaluating the volume measure for these listed areas of observed exposure and areas of subsurface contamination based on a gaseous/vapor intrusion or the potential for gaseous/vapor intrusion, consider the following:
▪ Calculate the volume of each regularly occupied structure based on actual data. If unknown, use a ceiling height of 8 feet.
▪ For multi-subunit structures, when calculating Tier C, calculate volume for those subunit spaces with observed or inferred exposure and all other regularly occupied subunit spaces on that level, unless available information indicates otherwise. If the structure has multiple stories, also include the volume of all regularly occupied subunit spaces below the floor with an observed exposure and one story above, unless evidence indicates otherwise.
▪ For multi-subunit structures within an area of subsurface contamination and no observed or inferred exposure, consider only the volume of the regularly occupied subunit spaces on the lowest story, unless available information indicates otherwise.
• For Tier D, area, if volume is unknown, use the area divisor listed in Tier D of Table 5-19 for those regularly occupied structures within areas of observed exposure with observed or inferred intrusion and within areas of subsurface contamination.
—In evaluating the area measure for these listed areas of observed exposure and areas of subsurface contamination, calculate the area of each regularly occupied structure (including multi-subunit structures) or subunit based on actual footprint area data.
▪ If the actual footprint area of the structure(s) is unknown, use an area of 1,740 square feet for each structure (or subunit space).
▪ For multi-subunit structures, when calculating Tier D, calculate area for those subunit spaces with observed or inferred exposure and all other regularly occupied subunit spaces on that level, unless available information indicates otherwise. If the structure has multiple stories, also include the area of all regularly occupied subunit spaces below the floor with an observed exposure and one story above, unless evidence indicates otherwise.
▪ For multi-subunit structures within an area of subsurface contamination and no observed or inferred exposure, consider only the area of the regularly occupied subunit spaces on the lowest story, unless available information indicates otherwise.

For the subsurface intrusion component, if the hazardous constituent quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed exposure, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. If the hazardous constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more areas of observed exposure or if one or more areas of subsurface contamination are present, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or assign a factor value as follows:
• If any target for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 2.5), assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for this component.
• If none of the targets for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations and if there has been a removal action that does not permanently interrupt target exposure from subsurface intrusion, and if an area of subsurface contamination exists, assign a factor value as follows:
—Determine the values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of the removal action.
—If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be 100 or greater, assign either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the component.
—If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be less than 100, assign a value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the component.
• Otherwise, if none of the targets for the subsurface intrusion component is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations and there has not been a removal action, assign a value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater.
Enter the value assigned in Table 5-11.
5.2.1.2.3
Calculation of waste characteristics factor category value.
Multiply the toxicity/degradation and hazardous waste quantity factor values, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10
8
. Based on this product, assign a value from Table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in Table 5-11.
5.2.1.3
Targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category for the subsurface intrusion threat based on three factors: Exposed individual, population, and resources in regularly occupied structures with structure containment factors greater than 0. Evaluate only those targets within areas of observed exposure and areas of subsurface contamination (see section 5.2.0).
In evaluating the targets factor category for the subsurface intrusion threat, count only the following as targets:
• Exposed individual—a person living, attending school or day care, or working in a regularly occupied structure with observed exposure or in a structure within an area of observed exposure or within an area of subsurface contamination.
• Population—exposed individuals in a regularly occupied structure within an area of observed exposure or within an area of subsurface contamination.
• Resources—located within an area of observed exposure or within an area of subsurface contamination as specified in section 5.2.1.3.3.
If a formerly occupied structure has been vacated due to subsurface intrusion attributable to the site, count the initial targets as if they were still residing in the structure. In addition, if a removal or temporary response action has occurred that has not completely mitigated the release, count the initial targets as if the removal or temporary
response action has not permanently interrupted target exposure from subsurface intrusion. Evaluate those targets based on conditions at the time of removal of temporary response action.
For populations residing in or working in a multi-subunit structure with multiple stories in an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination, count these targets as follows:
• If there is no observed exposure within the structure, include in the evaluation only those targets, if any, in the lowest occupied level. If sufficient structure-specific concentration data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk of exposure to targets in the lowest level, those targets are not included in the evaluation.
• If there is an observed exposure in any level, include in the evaluation those targets in that level, the level above and all levels below. (The weighting of these targets is specified in Section 5.2.1.3.2.) If sufficient structure-specific concentration data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk of exposure to targets in the level above where the observed exposure has been documented, those targets are not included in the evaluation.
5.2.1.3.1
Exposed individual.
Evaluate this factor based on whether there is an exposed individual, as specified in sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 5.2.1.3, who is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations.
First, determine those regularly occupied structures or partitioned subunit(s) within structures in an area of observed exposure subject to Level I concentrations and those subject to Level II concentrations as specified as follows (see section 5.2.0):
• Level I Concentrations: For contamination resulting from subsurface intrusion, compare the hazardous substance concentrations in any sample meeting the observed exposure by chemical analysis criteria to the appropriate benchmark. Use the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-20 to determine the level of contamination.
—If the sample is from a structure with no subunits and the concentration equals or exceeds the appropriate benchmark, assign Level I concentrations to the entire structure.
—If the sample is from a subunit within a structure and the concentration from that subunit equals or exceeds the appropriate benchmark, assign Level I concentrations to that subunit.
• Level II Concentrations: Structures, or subunits within structures, with one or more samples that meet observed exposure by chemical analysis criteria but do not equal or exceed the appropriate benchmark; structures, or subunits, that have an observed exposure by direct observation; and structures inferred to be in an area of observed exposure based on samples meeting observed exposure, are assigned Level II concentrations.
—For all regularly occupied structures, or subunits in such structures, in an area of observed exposure that are not assigned Level I concentrations, assign Level II concentrations.
Then assign a value to the exposed individual factor as follows:
• Assign a value of 50 if there is at least one exposed individual in one or more regularly occupied structures subject to Level I concentrations.
• Assign a value of 45 if there are no Level I exposed individuals, but there is at least one exposed individual in one or more regularly occupied structures subject to Level II concentrations.
• Assign a value of 20 if there is no Level I or Level II exposed individual but there is at least one individual in a regularly occupied structure within an area of subsurface contamination. Enter the value assigned in Table 5-11.
5.2.1.3.2
Population.
Evaluate population based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and population within an area of subsurface contamination. Determine which factors apply as specified in section 5.2.1.3.1, using the health-based benchmarks from Table 5-20. Evaluate populations subject to Level I and Level II concentrations as specified in section 2.5.
Table 5-20—Health-Based Benchmarks for Hazardous Substances in the Subsurface Intrusion Component
Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10
−6
individual cancer risk using the inhalation unit risk. For oral exposures use the oral cancer slope factor.
Screening concentration for noncancer toxicological responses corresponding to the reference dose (RfD) for oral exposure and the reference concentration (RfC) for inhalation exposures.
Count only those persons meeting the criteria for population as specified in section 5.2.1.3. In estimating the number of individuals in structures in an area of observed exposure or area of subsurface contamination if the actual number of residents is not known, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.
5.2.1.3.2.1
Level I concentrations.
Assign the population subject to Level I concentrations as follows:
1. Identify all exposed individuals regularly present in an eligible structure with a structure containment value greater than zero, or if the structure has subunits, identify those regularly present in each subunit,
located in an area of observed exposure subject to Level I concentrations as described in sections 5.2.0 and 5.2.1.3.1. Identify only once per structure those exposed individuals that are using more than one eligible subunit of the same structure (
e.g.,
using a common or shared area and other parts of the same structure).
2. For each structure or subunit count the number of individuals residing in or attending school or day care in the structure or subunit.
3. Count the number of full-time and part-time workers in the structure or subunit(s) subject to Level I concentrations. If information is unavailable to classify a worker as full- or part-time, evaluate that worker as being full-time. Divide the number of full-time workers by 3 and the number of part-time workers by 6, and then sum these products with the number of other individuals for each structure or subunit.
4. Sum this combined value for all structures, or subunits, within areas of observed exposure and multiply this sum by 10.
Assign the resulting product as the combined population factor value subject to Level I concentrations for the site. Enter this value in line 9a of Table 5-11.
5.2.1.3.2.2
Level II concentrations.
Assign the population subject to Level II concentrations as follows:
1. Identify all exposed individuals regularly present in an eligible structure with a structure containment value greater than zero, or if the structure has subunits, identify those regularly present in each subunit, located in an area of observed exposure subject to Level II concentrations as described in sections 5.2.0 and 5.2.1.3.1. Identify only once per structure those exposed individuals that are using more than one eligible subunit of the same structure (
e.g.,
using a common or shared area and other parts of the same structure).
2. Do not include exposed individuals already counted under the Level I concentrations factor.
3. For each structure or subunit(s), count the number of individuals residing in or attending school or day care in the structure, or subunit, subject to Level II concentrations.
4. Count the number of full-time and part-time workers in the structure or subunit(s) subject to Level II concentrations. If information is unavailable to classify a worker as full- or part-time, evaluate that worker as being full-time. Divide the number of full-time workers by 3 and the number of part-time workers by 6, and then sum these products with the number of other individuals for each structure or subunit.
5. Sum the combined population value for all structures within the areas of observed exposure for the site.
Assign this sum as the combined population factor value subject to Level II concentrations for this site. Enter this value in line 9b of Table 5-11.
5.2.1.3.2.3
Population within area(s) of subsurface contamination.
Assign the population in area(s) of subsurface contamination factor value as follows. If sufficient structure-specific concentration data is available and state of the science shows there is no unacceptable risk of exposure to populations in a regularly occupied structure in an area of subsurface contamination, those populations are not included in the evaluation. (see sections 5.2.0 and 5.2.1.3.1):
1. Identify the regularly occupied structures with a structure containment value greater than zero and the eligible population associated with the structures or portions of structures in each area of subsurface contamination:
• For each regularly occupied structure or portion of a structure in an area of subsurface contamination, sum the number of all individuals residing in or attending school or day care, in the structure or portion of the structure in the area of subsurface contamination.
• Count the number of full-time and part-time workers regularly present in each structure or portion of a structure in an area of subsurface contamination. If information is unavailable to classify a worker as full- or part-time, evaluate that worker as being full-time. Divide the number of full-time workers by 3 and the number of part-time workers by 6. Sum these products with the number of individuals residing in or attending school or day care in the structure.
• Use this sum as the population for the structure.
2. Estimate the depth or distance to contamination at each regularly occupied structure within an area of subsurface contamination based on available sampling data, and categorize each eligible structure based on the depth or distance to contamination and sample media as presented in Table 5-21. Weight the population in each structure using the appropriate weighting factors in Table 5-21. If samples from multiple media are available, use the sample that results in the highest weighting factor.
3. Sum the weighted population in all structures within the area(s) of subsurface contamination and assign this sum as the population within an area of subsurface contamination factor value. Enter this value in line 9c of Table 5-11.

6.1
Likelihood of Release.
Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.
6.1.1
Observed release.
Establish an observed release to the atmosphere by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the atmosphere. Base this demonstration on either:
• Direct observation—a material (for example, particulate matter) that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering the atmosphere directly. When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to the atmosphere, demonstrated adverse effects accumulated with that release may be used to establish an observed release.
• Chemical analysis—an analysis of air samples indicates that the concentration of ambient hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release.
If an observed release can be established, assign an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 6-1, and proceed to section 6.1.3. If an observed release cannot be established, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 6-1, and proceed to section 6.1.2.
6.1.2
Potential to release.
Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established. Determine the potential to release factor value for the site by separately evaluating the gas potential to release and the particulate potential to release for each source at the site. Select the highest potential to release value (either gas or particulate) calculated for the sources evaluated and assign that value as the site potential to release factor value as specified below.
6.1.2.1
Gas potential to release.
Evaluate gas potential to release for those sources that contain gaseous hazardous substances—that is, those hazardous substances with a vapor pressure greater than or equal to 10

Evaluate gas potential to release for each source based on three factors: gas containment, gas source type, and gas migration potential. Calculate the gas potential to release value as illustrated in table 6-2. Combine sources with similar characteristics into a single source in evaluating the gas potential to release factors.

6.1.2.1.2
Gas source type.
Assign a value for gas source type to each source as follows:
• Determine if the source meets the minimum size requirement based on the source hazardous waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5). If the source receives a source hazardous waste quantity value of 0.5 or more, consider the source to meet the minimum size requirement.
• If the source meets the minimum size requirement, assign it a value from table 6-4 for gas source type.
• If the source does not meet the minimum size requirement, assign it a value of 0 for gas source type.
If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, assign each source at the
site a value from table 6-4 for gas source type.

Gas migration potential.
Evaluate this factor for each source as follows:
• Assign a value for gas migration potential to each of the gaseous hazardous substances associated with the source (see section 2.2.2) as follows:
-Assign values from table 6-5 for vapor pressure and Henry's constant to each hazardous substance. If Henry's constant cannot be determined for a hazardous substance, assign that hazardous substance a value of 2 for the Henry's constant component.
-Sum the two values assigned to the hazardous substance.
-Based on this sum, assign the hazardous substance a value from table 6-6 for gas migration potential.
• Assign a value for gas migration potential to each source as follows:
-Select three hazardous substances associated with the source:
-If more than three gaseous hazardous substances can be associated with the source, select three that have the highest gas migration potential values.
-If fewer than three gaseous hazardous substances can be associated with a source, select all of them.
-Average the gas migration potential values assigned to the selected hazardous substances.
-Based on this average value, assign the source a gas migration potential value from table 6-7.

Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category based on two factors: toxicity/mobility and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the atmosphere. Such hazardous substances include:
• Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.
• All gaseous hazardous substances associated with a source that has a gas containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 6.1.2.1.1).
• All particulate hazardous substances associated with a source that has a particulate
containment factor value greater than 0 (see section 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 6.1.2.2.1).
6.2.1
Toxicity/mobility.
For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, and a combined toxicity/mobility factor value as specified below. Select the toxicity/mobility factor value for the air migration pathway as specified in section 6.2.1.3.
6.2.1.1
Toxicity.

6.2.1.2
Mobility.
Assign a mobility factor value to each hazardous substance as follows:
• Gaseous hazardous substance.
-Assign a mobility factor value of 1 to each gaseous hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.
-Assign a mobility factor value from table 6-11, based on vapor pressure, to each gaseous hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release.
• Particulate hazardous substance.
-Assign a mobility factor value of 0.02 to each particulate hazardous substance that meets the criteria for an observed release to the atmosphere.
-Assign a mobility factor value from Figure 6-3, based on the site's location, to each particulate hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release. (Assign all such particulate hazardous substances this same value.)
-For site locations not on Figure 6-3 and for site locations near the boundary points on Figure 6-3, assign a mobility factor value to each particulate hazardous substance that does not meet the criteria for an observed release as follows:
-Calculate a value M:
M = 0.0182 (U
3
/[PE]
2
)
where:
U = Mean average annual wind speed (meters per second).
PE = Thornthwaite P-E index from section 6.1.2.2.3.
-Based on the value M, assign a mobility factor value from table 6-12 to each particulate hazardous substance.
• Gaseous and particulate hazardous substances.
-For a hazardous substance potentially present in both gaseous and particulate forms, select the higher of the factor values for gas mobility and particulate mobility for that substance and assign that value as the mobility factor value for the hazardous substance.
6.2.1.3
Calculation of toxicity/mobility factor value.
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from table 6-13, based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors.

. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the waste characteristics factor category. Enter this value in table 6-1.
6.3
Targets.
Evaluate the targets factor category based on four factors: nearest individual, population, resources, and sensitive environments. Include only those targets (for example, individuals, sensitive environments) located within the 4-mile target distance limit, except: if an observed release is established beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, include those additional targets that are specified below in this section and in section 6.3.4.
Evaluate the nearest individual and population factors based on whether the target populations are subject to Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, or potential contamination. Determine which applies to a target population as follows.
If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air and if there is no observed release by direct observation, consider the entire population within the 4-mile target distance limit to be subject to potential contamination.
If one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air or if there is an observed release by direct observation, evaluate the population as follows:
• Determine the most distant sample location that meets the criteria for Level I concentrations as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 and the most distant location (that is, sample location or direct observation location) that meets the criteria for Level II concentrations. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 6-14 in determining the level of contamination for sample locations. If the most distant Level II location is closer to a source than the most distant Level I sample location, do not consider the Level II location.
• Determine the single most distant location (sample location or direct observation location) that meets the criteria for Level I or Level II concentrations.
• If this single most distant location is within the 4-mile target distance limit, identify the distance categories from table ­6-15 in which the selected Level I concentrations sample and Level II concentrations sample (or direct observation location) are located:
-Consider the target population anywhere within this furthest Level I distance category, or anywhere within a distance category closer to a source at the site, as subject to Level I concentrations.
-Consider the target population located beyond any Level I distance categories, up to and including the population anywhere within the furthest Level II distance category, as subject to Level II concentrations.
-Consider the remainder of the target population within the 4-mile target distance limit as subject to potential contamination.
• If the single most distant location is beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, identify the distance at which the selected Level I concentrations sample and Level II concentrations sample (or direct observation location) are located:
-If the Level I sample location is within the 4-mile target distance limit, identify the target population subject to Level I concentrations as specified above.
-If the Level I sample location is beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, consider the target population located anywhere within a distance from the sources at the site equal to the distance to this sample location to be subject to Level I concentrations and include them in the evaluation.
-Consider the target population located beyond the Level I target population, but located anywhere within a distance from the sources at the site equal to the distance to the selected Level II location, to be subject to Level II concentrations and include them in the evaluation.
-Do not include any target population as subject to potential contamination.

• If not, but if one or more a residences or regularly occupied buildings or areas is subject to Level II concentrations, assign a value of 45.
• If none of the residences and regularly occupied buildings and areas is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a value to this factor based on the shortest distance to any residence or regularly occupied building or area, as measured from any source at the site with an air migration containment factor value greater than 0. Based on this shortest distance, assign a value from table 6-16 to the nearest individual factor.

6.3.2
Population.
In evaluating the population factor, count residents, students, and workers regularly present within the target distance limit. Do not count transient populations such as customers and travelers passing through the area.
In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.
6.3.2.1
Level of contamination.
Evaluate the population factor based on three factors: Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination.
Evaluate the population subject to Level I concentrations (see section 6.3) as specified in section 6.3.2.2, the population subject to Level II concentrations as specified in section 6.3.2.3, and the population subject to potential contamination as specified in section 6.3.2.4.
For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 6.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.
6.3.2.2
Level I concentrations.
Sum the number of people subject to Level I concentrations. Multiply this sum by 10. Assign the product as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 6-1.
6.3.2.3
Level II concentrations.
Sum the number of people subject to Level II concentrations. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I concentrations factor. Assign this sum as the value for this factor. Enter this value in table 6-1.
6.3.2.4
Potential contamination.
Determine the number of people within each distance category of the target distance limit (see table 6-15) who are subject to potential contamination. Do not include those people already counted under the Level I and Level II concentrations factors.
Based on the number of people present within a distance category, assign a distance-weighted population value for that distance category from table 6-17. (Note that the distance-weighted population values in table 6-17 incorporate the distance weights from table 6-15. Do not multiply the values from table 6-17 by these distance weights.)
Calculate the potential contamination factor value (PI) as follows:
EC15NO91.164
where:
W
i
= Distance-weighted population from table 6-17 for distance category i.
n = Number of distance categories.
If PI is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if PI is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter this value in table 6-1.
6.3.2.5
Calculation of population factor value.
Sum the factor values for Level I concentrations, Level II concentrations, and potential contamination. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the population factor value. Enter this value in table 6-1.

Resources.
Evaluate the resources factor as follows:
• Assign a value of 5 if one or more of the following resources are present within one-half mile of a source at the site having an air migration containment factor value greater than 0:
-Commercial agriculture.
-Commercial silviculture.
-Major or designated recreation area.
• Assign a value of 0 if none of these resources is present.
Enter the value assigned in table 6-1.
6.3.4
Sensitive environments.
Evaluate sensitive environments based on two factors: actual contamination and potential contamination. Determine which factor applies as follows.
If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air and if there is no observed release by direct observation, consider all sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, within the target distance limit to be subject to potential contamination.
If one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release to air or if there is an observed release by direct observation, determine the most distant location (that is, sample location or direct observation location) that meets the criteria for an observed release:
• If the most distant location meeting the criteria for an observed release is within the 4-mile target distance limit, identify the distance category from table 6-15 in which it is located:
-Consider sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, anywhere within this distance category or anywhere within a distance category closer to a source at the site as subject to actual contamination.
-Consider all other sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, within the target distance limit as subject to potential contamination.
• If the most distant location meeting the criteria for an observed release is beyond the 4-mile target distance limit, identify the distance at which it is located:
-Consider sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, anywhere within a distance from the sources at the site equal to the distance to this location to be subject to actual contamination and include all such sensitive environments in the evaluation.
-Do not include any sensitive environments as subject to potential contamination.
6.3.4.1
Actual contamination.
Determine those sensitive environments subject to actual contamination (
i.e.
, those located partially or wholly within a distance category subject to actual contamination). Assign value(s) from table 4-23 (section 4.1.4.3.1.1) to each sensitive environment subject to actual contamination.
For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 6-18. In assigning a value from table 6-18, include only those portions of wetlands located within distance categories subject to actual contamination. If a wetland is located partially in a distance category subject to actual contamination and partially in one subject to potential contamination, then solely for purposes of table 6-18, count the portion in the distance category subject to potential contamination under the potential contamination factor in section 6.3.4.2. Determine the total acreage of wetlands within those distance categories subject to actual contamination and assign a value from table 6-18 based on this total acreage.
Calculate the actual contamination factor value (EA) as follows:

WA = Value assigned from table 6-18 for wetlands in distance categories subject to actual contamination.

Potential contamination.
Determine those sensitive environments located, partially or wholly, within the target distance limit that are subject to potential contamination. Assign value(s) from table 4-23 to each sensitive environment subject to potential contamination. Do not include those sensitive environments already counted for table 4-23 under the actual contamination factor.
For each distance category subject to potential contamination, sum the value(s) assigned from table 4-23 to the sensitive environments in that distance category. If a sensitive environment is located in more than one distance category, assign the sensitive
environment only to that distance category having the highest distance weighting value from table 6-15.
For those sensitive environments that are wetlands, assign an additional value from table 6-18. In assigning a value from table 6-18, include only those portions of wetlands located within distance categories subject to potential contamination, as specified in section 6.3.4.1. Treat the wetlands in each separate distance category as separate sensitive environments solely for purposes of applying table 6-18. Determine the total acreage of wetlands within each of these distance categories and assign a separate value from table 6-18 for each distance category.
Calculate the potential contamination factor value (EP) as follows:

If EP is less than 1, do not round it to the nearest integer; if EP is 1 or more, round to the nearest integer. Enter the value assigned in table 6-1.
6.3.4.3
Calculation of sensitive environments factor value.
Sum the factor values for actual contamination and potential contamination. Do not round this sum, designated as EB, to the nearest integer.
Because the pathway score based solely on sensitive environments is limited to a maximum of 60, use the value EB to determine the value for the sensitive environments factor as follows:
• Multiply the values assigned to likelihood of release (LR), waste characteristics (WC), and EB. Divide the product by 82,500.
-If the result is 60 or less, assign the value EB as the sensitive environments factor value.
-If the result exceeds 60, calculate a value EC as follows:
EC15NO91.167
Assign the value EC as the sensitive environments factor value. Do not round this value to the nearest integer.
Enter the value assigned for the sensitive environments factor in table 6-1.
6.3.5
Calculation of targets factor category value.
Sum the nearest individual, population, resources, and sensitive environments factor values. Do not round this sum to the nearest integer. Assign this sum as the targets factor category value. Enter this value in table 6-1.
6.4
Calculation of air migration pathway score.
Multiply the values for likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets, and round the product to the nearest integer. Then divide by 82,500. Assign the resulting value, subject to a maximum value of 100, as the air migration pathway score (S

). Enter this score in table 6-1.

# 7.0 Sites Containing Radioactive Substances.
In general, radioactive substances are hazardous substances under CERCLA and should be considered in HRS scoring. Releases of certain radioactive substances are, however, excluded from the definition of “release” in section 101(22) of CERCLA, as amended, and should not be considered in HRS scoring.
Evaluate sites containing radioactive substances using the instructions specified in sections 2 through 6, supplemented by the instructions in this section. Those factors denoted with a “yes” in table 7-1 are evaluated differently for sites containing radioactive substances than for sites containing only nonradioactive hazardous substances, while those denoted with a “no” are not evaluated differently and are not addressed in this section.

In general, sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances involve more evaluation than sites containing only radionuclides. For sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, HRS factors are evaluated based on considerations of both the radioactive substances and the other hazardous substances in order to derive a single set of factor values for each factor category in each of the four pathways. Thus, the HRS score for these sites reflects the combined potential hazards posed by both the radioactive and other hazardous substances.
Section 7 is organized by factor category, similar to sections 3 through 6. Pathway-specific differences in evaluation criteria are specified under each factor category, as appropriate. These differences apply largely to the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway and to sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances. All evaluation criteria specified in sections 2 through 6 must be met, except where modified in section 7.
7.1
Likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure.
Evaluate likelihood of release for the three migration pathways and likelihood of exposure for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as specified in sections 2 through 6, except: establish an observed release, observed contamination, and/or observed exposure as specified in section 7.1.1. When an observed release or exposure cannot be established for a migration pathway or the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, evaluate potential to release as specified in section 7.1.2. When observed contamination cannot be established, do not evaluate the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.
7.1.1
Observed release/observed contamination/observed exposure.
For radioactive substances, establish an observed release for each migration pathway by demonstrating that the site has released a radioactive substance to the pathway (or watershed or aquifer, as appropriate); establish observed contamination or observed exposure for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as indicated below. Base these demonstrations on one or more of the following, as appropriate to the pathway being evaluated:
• Direct observation:
—For each migration pathway, a material that contains one or more radionuclides has been seen entering the atmosphere, surface water, or ground water, as appropriate, or is known to have entered ground water or surface water through direct deposition, or
—For the surface water migration pathway, a source area containing radioactive substances has been flooded at a time that radioactive substances were present and one or more radioactive substances were in contact with the flood waters.
—For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, a material that contains one or more radionuclides has been observed entering a regularly occupied structure via the subsurface or is known to have entered a regularly occupied structure via the subsurface. Also, when evidence supports the inference of subsurface intrusion of a material that contains one or more radionuclides by the site into a regularly occupied structure, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be used to establish observed exposure by direct observation.
• Analysis of radionuclide concentrations in samples appropriate to the pathway (that is, ground water, soil, air, indoor air, soil gas, surface water, benthic, or sediment samples):
—For radionuclides that occur naturally and for radionuclides that are ubiquitous in the environment:
▪ Measured concentration (in units of activity, for example, pCi per kilogram [pCi/kg], pCi per liter [pCi/L], pCi per cubic meter [pCi/m3]) of a given radionuclide in the sample are at a level that:
○ Equals or exceeds a value 2 standard deviations above the mean site-specific background concentration for that radionuclide in that type of sample, or
○ Exceeds the upper-limit value of the range of regional background concentration values for that specific radionuclide in that type of sample.
▪ Some portion of the increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure), and
▪ For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway only, the radionuclide must also be present at the surface or covered by 2 feet or less of cover material (for example, soil) to establish observed contamination.
—For man-made radionuclides without ubiquitous background concentrations in the environment:
▪ Measured concentration (in units of activity) of a given radionuclide in a sample equals or exceeds the sample quantitation limit for that specific radionuclide in that type of media and is attributable to the site.
▪ However, if the radionuclide concentration equals or exceeds its sample quantitation limit, but its release can also be attributed to one or more neighboring sites, then the measured concentration of that radionuclide must also equal or exceed a value either 2 standard deviations above the mean concentration of
that radionuclide contributed by those neighboring sites or 3 times its background concentration, whichever is lower.
▪ If the sample quantitation limit cannot be established:
○ If the sample analysis was performed under the EPA Contract Laboratory Program, use the EPA contract-required quantitation limit (CRQL) in place of the sample quantitation limit in establishing an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure).
○ If the sample analysis is not performed under the EPA Contract Laboratory Program, use the detection limit in place of the sample quantitation limit.
▪ For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway only, the radionuclide must also be present at the surface or covered by 2 feet or less of cover material (for example, soil) to establish observed contamination.
• Gamma radiation measurements (applies only to observed contamination or observed exposure in the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway):
—The gamma radiation exposure rate, as measured in microroentgens per hour (µR/hr) using a survey instrument held 1 meter above the ground surface or floor or walls of a structure (or 1 meter away from an aboveground source for the soil exposure component), equals or exceeds 2 times the site-specific background gamma radiation exposure rate.
—Some portion of the increase must be attributable to the site to establish observed contamination or observed exposure. The gamma-emitting radionuclides do not have to be within 2 feet of the surface of the source.
For the three migration pathways and for the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if an observed release or observed exposure can be established for the pathway (or component, threat, aquifer, or watershed, as appropriate), assign the pathway (or component, threat, aquifer, or watershed) an observed release or observed exposure factor value of 550 and proceed to section 7.2. If an observed release or observed exposure cannot be established, assign an observed release or observed exposure factor value of 0 and proceed to section 7.1.2.
For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if observed contamination can be established, assign the likelihood of exposure factor for resident population a value of 550 if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more locations listed in section 5.1.1; evaluate the likelihood of exposure factor for nearby population as specified in section 5.1.2.1; and proceed to section 7.2. If observed contamination cannot be established, do not evaluate the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate observed release (or component, observed contamination or observed exposure) separately for radionuclides as described in this section and for other hazardous substances as described in sections 2 through 6.
For the three migration pathways and the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if an observed release or observed exposure can be established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, or both, assign the pathway (or threat, aquifer, or watershed) an observed release or observed exposure factor value of 550 and proceed to section 7.2. If an observed release or observed exposure cannot be established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, assign an observed release or observed exposure factor value of 0 and proceed to section 7.1.2.
For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if observed contamination can be established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, or both, assign the likelihood of exposure factor for resident population a value of 550 if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more locations listed in section 5.1.1; evaluate the likelihood of exposure factor for nearby population as specified in section 5.1.2.1; and proceed to section 7.2. If observed contamination cannot be established based on either radionuclides or other hazardous substances, do not evaluate the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.
7.1.2 Potential to release/potential for exposure. For the three migration pathways and the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, evaluate potential to release or potential for exposure for sites containing radionuclides in the same manner as specified for sites containing other hazardous substances. Base the evaluation on the physical and chemical properties of the radionuclides, not on their level of radioactivity. For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if the potential for exposure is based on the presence of gamma emitting radioactive substances, assign a potential for exposure factor value of 500 only if the contamination is found within 2 feet beneath a regularly occupied structure, otherwise assign a potential for exposure factor value of 0.
For sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate potential to release or potential for exposure considering radionuclides and other hazardous
substances together. Evaluate potential to release for each migration pathway and the potential for exposure for the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as specified in sections 3 through 6, as appropriate.
7.2
Waste characteristics.
For radioactive substances, evaluate the human toxicity factor, the ecosystem toxicity factor, the surface water persistence factor, and the hazardous waste quantity factor as specified in the following sections. Evaluate all other waste characteristic factors as specified in sections 2 through 6.
7.2.1 Human Toxicity. For radioactive substances, evaluate the human toxicity factor as specified below, not as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
Assign human toxicity factor values to those radionuclides available to the pathway based on quantitative dose-response parameters for cancer risks as follows:
• Evaluate radionuclides only on the basis of carcinogenicity and assign all radionuclides to weight-of-evidence category A, or weight-of-evidence category “Carcinogenic to Humans”.
• Assign a human toxicity factor value from Table 7-2 to each radionuclide based on its slope factor (also referred to as a cancer potency factor).
—For each radionuclide, use the higher of the slope factors for inhalation and ingestion to assign the factor value.
—If only one slope factor is available for the radionuclide use it to assign the toxicity factor value.
—If no slope factor is available for the radionuclide, assign that radionuclide a toxicity factor value of 0 and use other radionuclides for which a slope factor is available to evaluate the pathway.
• If all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0 (that is, no slope factor is available for all the radionuclides), use a default human toxicity factor value of 1,000 as the human toxicity factor value for all radionuclides available to the pathway.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate the toxicity factor separately for the radioactive and other hazardous substances and assign each a separate toxicity factor value. This applies regardless of whether the radioactive and other hazardous substances are physically separated, combined chemically, or simply mixed together. Assign toxicity factor values to the radionuclides as specified above and to the other hazardous substances as specified in section 2.4.1.1.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, if all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0, use a default human toxicity factor value of 1,000 for all those radionuclides even if nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are assigned human toxicity factor values greater than 0. Similarly, if all nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are assigned a human toxicity factor value of 0, use a default human toxicity factor value of 100 for all these nonradioactive hazardous substances even if radionuclides available to the pathway are assigned human toxicity factor values greater than 0.
7.2.2 Ecosystem toxicity.
For the surface water environmental threat (see sections 4.1.4 and 4.2.4). assign an ecosystem toxicity factor value to radionuclides (alone or combined chemically or mixed with other hazardous substances) using the same slope factors and procedures specified for the human toxicity factor in section 7.2.1, except: use a default of 100, not 1,000, if all radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for ecosystem toxicity receive an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0.

Radionuclide slope factors are estimates of age-averaged, individual lifetime total excess cancer risk per picocurie of radionuclide inhaled or ingested.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate the ecosystem toxicity factor separately for the radioactive and other hazardous substances and assign each a separate ecosystem toxicity factor value. This applies regardless of whether the radioactive and other hazardous substances are physically separated, combined chemically, or simply mixed together. Assign ecosystem toxicity factor values to the radionuclides as specified above and to the other hazardous substances as specified in sections 4.1.4.2.1.1 and 4.2.4.2.1.1. If all radionuclides available to a particular pathway are assigned an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0, use a default ecosystem toxicity factor value of 100 for all these radionuclides even if nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are assigned ecosystem toxicity factor values greater than 0. Similarly, if all nonradioactive hazardous substances available to the pathway are assigned an ecosystem toxicity factor value of 0, use a default ecosystem toxicity factor value of 100 for all these nonradioactive hazardous substances even if radionuclides available to the pathway are assigned ecosystem toxicity factor values greater than 0.
7.2.3
Persistence/Degradation.
In determining the surface water persistence factor for radionuclides, evaluate this factor based solely on half-life; do not include sorption to sediments in the evaluation as is done for nonradioactive hazardous substances. Assign a persistence factor value from Table 4-10 (section 4.1.2.2.1.2) to each radionuclide based on half-life (t
1/2
) calculated as follows:
ER09JA17.073
Where:
r = Radioactive half-life.
V = Volatilization half-life.
If the volatilization half-life cannot be estimated for a radionuclide from available data, delete it from the equation. Select the portion of Table 4-10 to use in assigning the persistence factor value as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate the persistence factor separately for each radionuclide and for each nonradioactive hazardous substance, even if the available data indicate that they are combined chemically. Assign a persistence factor value to each radionuclide as specified in this section and to each nonradioactive hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2. When combined chemically, assign a single persistence factor value based on the higher of the two values assigned (individually) to the radioactive and nonradioactive components.
In determining the subsurface intrusion degradation factor for radionuclides, when evaluating this factor based solely on half-life, assign a degradation factor value from section 5.2.1.2.1.2 to each radionuclide based on half-life (t
1/2
) calculated as follows:
ER09JA17.074
Where:
r = Radioactive half-life.
If no radioactive half-life information is available for a radionuclide and the substance is not already assigned a value of 1, unless information indicates otherwise, assign a value of 1.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, evaluate the degradation factor separately for each radionuclide and for each nonradioactive hazardous substance, even if the available data indicate that they are combined chemically. Assign a degradation factor value to each radionuclide as specified in this section and to each nonradioactive hazardous substance as specified in section 5.2.1.2.1.2. If no radioactive half-life information is available for a radionuclide and the substance is not already assigned a value of 1, unless information indicates otherwise, assign a value of 1. Similarly, if no half-life information is available for a nonradioactive substance, and the substance is not already assigned a value of 1, unless information indicates otherwise, assign a value of 1. When combined chemically, assign a single persistence or degradation factor value based on the higher of the two values assigned (individually) to the radioactive and nonradioactive components.
7.2.4
Selection of substance potentially posing greatest hazard.
For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway and each migration pathway (or threat, aquifer, or watershed, as appropriate), select the radioactive substance or nonradioactive hazardous substance that potentially poses the greatest hazard based on its toxicity factor value, combined with the applicable mobility, persistence, degradation and/or bioaccumulation (or ecosystem bioaccumulation) potential factor values. Combine these factor values as specified in sections 2 through 6. For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, base the selection on the toxicity factor alone (see sections 2 and 5).
7.2.5
Hazardous waste quantity.
To calculate the hazardous waste quantity factor value for sites containing radioactive substances, evaluate source hazardous waste quantity (see section 2.4.2.1) using only the following two measures in the following hierarchy (these measures are consistent with
Tiers A and B for nonradioactive hazardous substances in sections 2.4.2.1.1 and 2.4.2.1.2):
• Radionuclide constituent quantity (Tier A).
• Radionuclide wastestream quantity (Tier B).
7.2.5.1
Source hazardous waste quantity for radionuclides.
For each migration pathway, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each source having a containment factor value greater than 0 for the pathway being evaluated. For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each area of observed contamination, as applicable to the threat being evaluated. For the subsurface intrusion component, assign a source hazardous waste quantity value to each regularly occupied structure located within areas of observed exposure or areas of subsurface contamination. Allocate hazardous substances and hazardous wastestreams to specific sources (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure or areas of subsurface contamination) as specified in sections 2.4.2 and 5.2.0.
7.2.5.1.1
Radionuclide constituent quantity (Tier A).
Evaluate radionuclide constituent quantity for each source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the activity content of the radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) as follows:
• Estimate the net activity content (in curies) for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on:
—Manifests, or
—Either of the following equations, as applicable:
ER09JA17.075
Where:
N = Estimated net activity content (in curies) for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure).
V = Total volume of material (in cubic yards) in a source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) containing radionuclides.
AC
i
= Activity concentration above the respective background concentration (in pCi/g) for each radionuclide i allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure).
n = Number of radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) above the respective background concentrations.
or,
ER09JA17.076
Where:
N = Estimated net activity content (in curies) for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure).
V = Total volume of material (in gallons) in a source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) containing radionuclides.
AC
i
= Activity concentration above the respective background concentration (in pCi/1) for each radionuclide i allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure).
n = Number of radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) above the respective background concentrations.
—Estimate volume for the source (or volume for the area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on records or measurements.
—For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, in estimating the volume for areas of observed contamination, do not include more than the first 2 feet of depth, except:
for those types of areas of observed contamination listed in Tier C of Table 5-2 (section 5.1.1.2.2), include the entire depth, not just that within 2 feet of the surface.
—For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, in estimating the volume for areas of observed exposure, only use the volume of air in the regularly occupied structures where observed exposure has been documented.
• Convert from curies of radionuclides to equivalent pounds of nonradioactive hazardous substances by multiplying the activity estimate for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) by 1,000.
• Assign this resulting product as the radionuclide constituent quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure).
If the radionuclide constituent quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) is adequately determined (that is, the total activity of all radionuclides in the source and releases from the source [or in the area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure] is known or is estimated with reasonable confidence), do not evaluate the radionuclide wastestream quantity measure in section 7.2.5.1.2. Instead, assign radionuclide wastestream quantity a value of 0 and proceed to section 7.2.5.1.3. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not adequately determined, assign the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) a value for radionuclide constituent quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 7.2.5.1.2.
7.2.5.1.2 Radionuclide wastestream quantity (Tier B). Evaluate radionuclide wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) based on the activity content of radionuclide wastestreams allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) as follows:
• Estimate the total volume (in cubic yards or in gallons) of wastestreams containing radionuclides allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination).
• Divide the volume in cubic yards by 0.55 (or the volume in gallons by 110) to convert to the activity content expressed in terms of equivalent pounds of nonradioactive hazardous substances.
• Assign the resulting value as the radionuclide wastestream quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination).
• For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, estimate the total wastestream volume for all regularly occupied structures that have a containment value
0 and that are located within areas of observed exposure with observed or inferred intrusion, and within areas of subsurface contamination. Calculate the volume of each regularly occupied structure based on actual data. If unknown, use a ceiling height of 8 feet.
7.2.5.1.3 Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value for radionuclides. Select the higher of the values assigned to the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, and/or area of subsurface contamination) for radionuclide constituent quantity and radionuclide wastestream quantity. Assign this value as the source hazardous waste quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). Do not round to the nearest integer.
7.2.5.2 Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value for radionuclides. Sum the source hazardous waste quantity values assigned to all sources (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except: if the sum is greater than 0, but less than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select a hazardous waste quantity factor value for this pathway from Table 2-6 (section 2.4.2.2).
For a migration pathway, if the radionuclide constituent quantity is adequately determined (see section 7.2.5.1.1) for all sources (or all portions of sources and releases remaining after a removal action), assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions of sources or releases remaining after a removal action), assign a factor value as follows:
• If any target for that migration pathway is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations (see section 7.3), assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
• If none of the targets for that pathway is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign a factor value as follows:
—If there has been no removal action, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway.
—If there has been a removal action:
▪ Determine values from Table 2-6 with and without consideration of the removal action.
▪ If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be 100 or greater, assign either the value from Table 2-6 with consideration of the removal action or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
▪ If the value that would be assigned from Table 2-6 without consideration of the removal action would be less than 100, assign a value of 10 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if the radionuclide constituent quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed contamination, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more areas of observed contamination, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value.
For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, if the radionuclide constituent quantity is adequately determined for all areas of observed exposure, assign the value from Table 2-6 as the hazardous waste quantity factor value. If the radionuclide constituent quantity is not adequately determined for one or more areas of observed exposure, assign either the value from Table 2-6 or a value of 10, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value.
7.2.5.3 Calculation of hazardous waste quantity factor value for sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances. For each source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, calculate two source hazardous waste quantity values—one based on radionuclides as specified in sections 7.2.5.1 through 7.2.5.1.3 and the other based on the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in sections 2.4.2.1 through 2.4.2.1.5, and sections 5.1.1.2.2, 5.1.2.2.2 and 5.2.1.2.2 (that is, determine each value as if the other type of substance was not present). Sum the two values to determine a combined source hazardous waste quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). Do not round this value to the nearest integer.
Use this combined source hazardous waste quantity value to calculate the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway as specified in section 2.4.2.2, except: if either the hazardous constituent quantity or the radionuclide constituent quantity, or both, are not adequately determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions of sources or releases remaining after a removal action) or for one or more areas of observed contamination or areas of observed exposure, as applicable, assign the value from Table 2-6 or the default value applicable for the pathway, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.
7.3 Targets. For radioactive substances, evaluate the targets factor category as specified in section 2.5 and sections 3 through 6, except: Establish Level I and Level II concentrations at sampling locations as specified in sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 and establish weighting factors for populations associated with an area of subsurface contamination in the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as specified in section 7.3.3.
For all pathways (components and threats), use the same target distance limits for sites containing radioactive substances as is specified in sections 3 through 6 for sites containing nonradioactive hazardous substances. At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, include all sources (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) at the site in identifying the applicable targets for the pathway.
7.3.1
Level of contamination at a sampling location.
Determine whether Level I or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated targets) as follows:
• Select the benchmarks from section 7.3.2 applicable to the pathway (or component or threat) being evaluated.
• Compare the concentrations of radionuclides in the sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the pathway (or component or threat) as specified in section 7.3.2. Treat comparable samples as specified in section 2.5.1.
• Determine which level applies based on this comparison.
• If none of the radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location have an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (or component or threat).
• In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only those radionuclides in the sample, that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used for the human food chain threat of the surface water pathway as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.
7.3.2
Comparison to benchmarks.
Use the following media specific benchmarks (expressed in activity units, for example,pCi/l
for water, pCi/kg for soil and for aquatic human food chain organisms, and pCi/m3 for air) for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway (or threat):
• Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—ground water migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.
• Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) standards—soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway only.
• Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10
−6
individual cancer risk for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway and subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway) or for oral exposures (ground water migration pathway; drinking water or human food chain threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway).
—For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, include two screening concentrations for cancer—one for ingestion of surface materials and one for external radiation exposures from gamma-emitting radionuclides in surface materials.
Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (component or threat) being evaluated. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide from the sampling location to its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (component or threat). Use only those samples and only those radionuclides in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of any applicable radionuclide from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (component or threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the radionuclide, assign Level I if the radionuclide concentration equals or exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration. In addition, for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign Level I concentrations at the sampling location if measured gamma radiation exposure rates equal or exceed 2 times the background level (see section 7.1.1).
If no radionuclide individually equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3), calculate a value for index I for these radionuclides as specified in section 2.5.2. If I equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If I is less than 1, assign Level II.
At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, establish the level of contamination for each sampling location considering radioactive substances and nonradioactive hazardous substances separately. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide and each nonradioactive hazardous substance from the sampling location to its respective benchmark concentration(s). Use only those samples and only those substances in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of one or more applicable radionuclides or other hazardous substances from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations. If more than one benchmark applies to a radionuclide or other hazardous substance, assign Level I if the concentration of the radionuclide or other hazardous substance equals or exceeds its lowest applicable benchmark concentration.
If no radionuclide or other hazardous substance individually exceed a benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide or other hazardous substance either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample, calculate an index I for both types of substances as specified in section 2.5.2. Sum the index I values for the two types of substances. If the value, individually or combined, equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sample location. If it is less than 1, calculate an index J for the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in section 2.5.2. If J equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If J is less than 1, assign Level II.
7.3.3 Weighting of targets within an area of subsurface contamination. For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign a weighting factor as specified in section 5.2.1.3.2.3 except when a structure in an area of subsurface contamination is delineated or inferred to be delineated by gamma radiation exposure rates meeting observed release criteria with a depth to contamination of 2 feet or less. For those populations residing, working, or attending school or day care in a structure delineated or inferred to be delineated by gamma radiation exposure rates meeting observed release criteria with
a depth to contamination of 2 feet or less, assign a weighting factor of 0.9.

Applicability and Scope.
This Appendix establishes laboratory protocols required under Subpart J (Use of Dispersants and Other Chemical and Biological Agents) of 40 CFR part 300 (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan) to make listing determinations for the Product Schedule. The protocols apply, based on product type, to dispersants, bioremediation agents, surface washing agents, herding agents, and solidifiers as defined in Subpart A (Introduction) of 40 CFR part 300.
2.0
Baffled Flask Dispersant Efficacy Test (BFT)
2.1
Summary.
This laboratory protocol establishes procedures to evaluate the degree to which a product effectively disperses oil spilled on the surface of seawater, using a modified 150-mL screw-cap trypsinizing flask (an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles) with a glass and Teflon® stopcock near the bottom to allow removal of subsurface water samples without disturbing the surface oil layer. The efficacy of a dispersant is measured using one reference oil, Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve Bryan Mound at two temperatures (5 °C and 25 °C). Six replicates and one method blank are required at each temperature. A layer of oil is placed on the surface of artificial seawater, and the dispersant is added to the slick at a dispersant:oil ratio (DOR) of 1:25 (4%) by volume. A standard orbital shaker table provides turbulent mixing at a speed of 250 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes, immediately after which it is maintained stationary for 10 minutes to allow non-dispersed oil to rise to the water's surface. An undisturbed water sample is removed from the bottom of the flask through the stopcock, extracted with dichloromethane (DCM), and analyzed for oil content by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths ranging between 340 and 400 nm.
2.2
Apparatus.
All equipment must be maintained and calibrated per standard laboratory procedures.
2.2.1
Modified Trypsinizing Flask.
A modified 150 mL glass screw-capped Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles (
e.g.,
Wheaton No. 355394 or equivalent) fitted with a 2 mm bore Teflon® stopcock and glass tubing, the center of which is no more than 1.3 cm from the bottom, as shown in Figure 1.
ER12JN23.078

# Figure 1. A Baffled Trypsinizing Flask
2.2.2
Orbital Shaker Table.
An orbital shaker table with a variable speed control unit capable of maintaining 250 rpm. The orbital diameter must be approximately 1.0 inch (2.5 cm) ±0.1 inch (0.25 cm).
2.2.3
Spectrophotometer.
A UV-visible spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance between 340 and 400 nm (
e.g.,
Shimadzu UV-1800, Agilent 8453, or equivalent). Use standard transmission-matched quartz 10-mm path length rectangular cells with PTFE cover for absorbance measurements.
2.2.4
Glassware.
Including: 25-ml graduated mixing cylinders (a graduated cylinder with a ground glass stopper); 50- and 100-ml graduated cylinders; 125-mL separatory funnels with Teflon stopcocks; 10-ml volumetric flasks; 30-ml crimp style glass serum bottles; 1-, 2-, 5-mL pipettes; other miscellaneous laboratory items.
2.2.5
Micropipettor.
Use a micropipettor capable of dispensing 4 µL of dispersant and 100
µL of oil (
e.g.,
Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor with 100 µL and 5 mL syringe tip attachments or equivalent).
2.2.6
Syringes.
25-, 100-, 250-, 1,000-, 2,500-, 5,000-µl gas-tight syringes.
2.2.7
Constant temperature rooms or incubators to hold the shaker at
5 °C and 25 °C.
2.2.8
Analytical Balance.
2.2.9
Chemical fume hood.
2.3
Reagents.
2.3.1
Artificial seawater.
Use the artificial seawater GP2 formulation shown in Table 1 of this Appendix.
2.3.2
Test oil.
Use the EPA standard reference oil Strategic Petroleum Reserve Bryan Mound. To obtain this oil at no charge (except for a minimal shipping fee), see the instructions at
http://www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/ncp/index.htm.
Selected properties are summarized in Table 2 of this Appendix.
2.3.3
Dichloromethane (DCM) (also known as methylene chloride), pesticide quality.
2.4
Container Handling and Storage.
2.4.1
Glassware.
If the glassware has been used with oil before, rinse with DCM to remove as much of the oil adhering to the sides of the flask as possible; waste DCM may be used. Soak in warm water with detergent and individually wash with bristled brushes. First rinse with tap water, then follow with two de-ionized water rinses. Dry either on a rack or in a 110 °C drying oven. After drying, rinse with fresh DCM (use sparingly).
2.4.2
Serum bottles and other non-volumetric glassware.
Bake for at least 4 hours in a muffle furnace at 450 °C.
2.5
Calibration Curve for the UV-visible spectrophotometer.
2.5.1

Stock standard solution concentrations are based on the mass measurements after each addition and density determinations of the oil/dispersant/DCM solution using a density bottle or a 1-mL gas tight syringe. An example calculation is given in Table 3 of this Appendix according to the following equation:
ER28JN23.004
Use the reference oil and the specific dispersant being tested for a particular set of experimental test runs. Prepare the stock standard solution of dispersant-oil mixture in DCM, starting with 2 ml of the oil, then adding 80 µl of the dispersant followed by 18 ml of DCM.
2.5.2 Six
-point Calibration Curve.
For the reference oil, add specific volumes of its stock standard solution (given in Table 4 of this Appendix) to 30 ml of artificial seawater in a 125 ml separatory funnel. Extract the oil/dispersant water mixture with triplicate 5 ml volumes of DCM. Follow each DCM addition by 15 seconds of vigorous shaking, carefully releasing the initial pressure inside the separatory funnel by partially removing the glass stopper inside a fume hood after the first few shakes. Then, allow a 2-minute stationary period for phase separation for each extraction. Drain the extracts into a 25-mL graduated mixing cylinder. Release any entrained bubbles of DCM from the water layer by sideways shaking of the funnel. Use precaution not to drain water into the DCM extract as it can affect the absorbance readings. Adjust the final volume of the collected extracts to 25 mL in the mixing cylinder using DCM. Determine specific masses for oil concentrations in the standards as volumes of oil/dispersant solution multiplied by the concentration of the stock solution. An example calculation is given in Table 4 of this Appendix. One calibration curve is needed for the reference oil and dispersant combination.
2.6
Sample Preparation and Testing.
See section 2.7 of this Appendix for a detailed description of the spectrophotometer's linear calibration procedure.
2.6.1 Six replicates of the oil and test dispersant are required at each temperature plus two additional tests of method blanks (artificial seawater without oil and dispersant), one at each temperature. A completed test consists of 14 baffled flask tests (a total of six replicates for the reference oil/test dispersant combination at two temperatures (5 °C and 25 °C), plus two method blanks).
2.6.2 Attach a 3-inch length of Teflon tubing to the stopcock of each of the 150-mL baffled flasks. Add 120 mL of artificial seawater to each flask. Put screw cap on flasks and place them at the appropriate temperature (either 5 °C or 25 °C) for equilibration.
2.6.3 Calibrate and adjust the shaker table to 250 ± 10 rpm.
2.6.4 Prepare and time separately each baffled flask. Sequentially add 100 µL of oil and 4 µL of dispersant to the flask layering them onto the center of the seawater to give a dispersant-to-oil ratio (DOR) of 1:25. Avoid any oil or dispersant splashing on the flask walls, as it may reduce efficacy or cause errors in the calculated results. Discard the sample and repeat the setup if: (1) any oil or dispersant splashing occurs during the additions, or (2) the dispersant contacts the
water first rather than the oil. This is especially important for 5 °C work because of increased oil viscosity.
2.6.5 For the oil, fill the tip of the pipettor, using a wipe to remove any oil from the sides of the tip. Holding the pipettor vertically, dispense several times back into the reservoir to ensure that the oil flows smoothly. Insert the syringe tip vertically into the baffled flask and let the bottom of the pipettor rest on the neck of the flask. Slowly and carefully dispense the oil one time onto the center of the water's surface. The remainder of the oil can either be returned to the oil bottle or set aside for use in the next test flask.
Note to 2.6.5:
If a Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor is used for dispensing the oil, attach a 5-mL syringe tip, and set the dial to 1.
2.6.6 For the dispersant, use the same procedure as for the oil to dispense onto the center of the oil slick surface. As the dispersant first contacts the oil, it will usually push the oil to the sides of the flask. Replace the screw cap onto the flask.
Note to 2.6.6:
If a Brinkmann Eppendorf repeater pipettor is used for dispensing the dispersant, attach a 100-µL syringe tip, and set the dial to 2.
2.6.7 Carefully place flask securely onto the shaker and agitate for 10 ± 0.25 minutes at 250 ± 10 rpm.
2.6.8 Remove the flask from the shaker table and allow a stationary, quiescent period of 10 ± 0.25 minutes to allow undispersed and/or recoalesced oil droplets to refloat to the surface.
2.6.9 Carefully open the screw cap, then the stopcock at the bottom, and discard the first several mL of seawater into a waste beaker to remove non-mixed water-oil initially trapped in the stopcock tubing. Collect a volume slightly greater than 30-mL into a 50-mL graduated cylinder. Adjust the collected volume to the 30-mL mark by removing excess with a disposable glass Pasteur pipette. A web-like emulsion may form at the solvent/water interface during the water sample extraction. Avoid pulling any emulsion phase into the DCM extract as it may cloud the DCM-extract, leading to error.
2.6.10 Transfer the water-oil sample from the graduated cylinder into a 125-mL glass separatory funnel fitted with a Teflon stopcock.
2.6.11 Add 5 mL DCM to the separatory funnel. Start shaking, releasing pressure into the fume hood by loosening the glass stopper. Shake vigorously at least 20 times for 15 seconds.
2.6.12 Allow the funnel to remain in a stationary position for 2 minutes to allow phase separation of the water and DCM.
2.6.13 Drain the DCM layer from the separatory funnel into a 25 mL mixing cylinder. Avoid pulling any emulsion phase into the DCM extract as it may cloud the DCM extract.
2.6.14 Repeat the DCM-extraction process two or three additional times until the DCM is clear. Collect each extract in the graduated cylinder. After the final extraction, lightly shake the separatory funnel sideways once or twice to dislodge entrained bubbles of DCM and drain.
2.6.15 Adjust the final volume to a known quantity, 25 mL, in the mixing cylinder. Using a syringe, dispense 2.5 mL or 5.0 mL of a reference oil sample into a 10-mL volumetric flask, and fill with DCM to make either a 1:4 or 1:2 dilution, respectively.
2.6.16 If analysis cannot be conducted immediately, store the extracted DCM samples at 4 ± 2 °C until time of analysis. Glass-stoppered mixing cylinders may be used for short-term storage or prior to bringing the extracts up to volume. After bringing to volume, transfer the DCM extracts to 25-30 ml crimp-style serum vials with aluminum/Teflon seals.
2.6.17 Complete all analysis within 10 consecutive days from when the sample was collected.
2.7
UV-Visible Spectrophotometer Linear Stability Calibration
2.7.1 A six-point calibration of the UV-visible spectrophotometer is required at least once per day for each oil. The stability calibration criterion is determined with the six oil standards identified in Table 4 of this Appendix.
2.7.2 Turn on spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up for at least 30 minutes before beginning analysis. Blank the instrument for the wavelengths between 340 and 400 nm with DCM.
2.7.3 If refrigerated, allow all extracts, standards, and samples to warm to room temperature.
2.7.4 Determine the absorbance of the six standards between the wavelengths of 340 and 400 nm. This can be done by either one of the following methods:
2.7.4.1
Trapezoidal Rule.
Program the spectrophotometer to take readings every 5λ or 10λ and calculate the area under the curve using the Trapezoidal rule:
ER28JN23.005
where N + 1 = number of absorbance measurements to delineate N equally spaced sections of the curve, and H = the distance (λ) between each reading. For H = 5, N + 1 = 13 measurements, for H = 10, N + 1 = 7. The following formula illustrates readings taken every 10λ.
ER28JN23.006
When using readings taken every 5λ, each absorbance sum is multiplied by 5.
2.7.4.2 Automatic
Integration.
Program the spectrophotometer to automatically integrate the area under the curve between 340 nm and 400 nm.
2.7.4.3 If the wavelengths must be manually set on the spectrophotometer, the older method of only measuring at 340λ, 370λ, and 400λ may be used. Then calculate using the trapezoidal rule for N + 1 = 3, H = 30. While the resulting area count with the older method is less accurate, the final results are similar since the inaccuracy is systematic.
2.7.5 After determining the area count for each standard, determine the response factor (RF) for the oil at each concentration using the following equation:
ER28JN23.007
2.7.6 Spectrophotometer stability for the initial calibration is acceptable when the RFs of the six standard extracts are less than 10% different from the overall mean value for the six standards, as calculated in Equation 5 of this Appendix and depicted in the example in Table 4 of this Appendix.
ER28JN23.008
2.7.7 If this criterion is satisfied, begin analysis of sample extracts. Absorbances greater than or equal to 3.5 are not included because absorbance saturation occurs at and above this value. If any of the standard oil extracts fails to satisfy the initial-stability criterion, the source of the problem (
e.g.,
preparation protocol for the oil standards, spectrophotometer stability, etc.) must be corrected before analysis of the sample extracts begins.
2.7.8 Determine the slope of the calibration points by using linear regression forced zero intercept:
ER28JN23.009
2.8 Spectrophotometric
Analysis and Calculations
2.8.1 Once a successful calibration curve for the reference oil has been created and verified, measure experimental replicates for the reference oil at each temperature followed by a standard check sample.
2.8.2 Determine the area for the absorbance values obtained for the experimental samples by using Equation 2 of this Appendix and illustrated by Equation 3 of this Appendix.
2.8.3 Calculate the Total Oil dispersed and the percentage of oil dispersed (%OD) based on the ratio of oil dispersed in the test system to the total oil added to the system, as follows:
ER28JN23.010
where:
V
DCM
= final volume of the DCM extract (mL)
V
tw
= total seawater in Baffled Flask (120 mL)
V
ew
= volume seawater extracted (30 mL)
ER28JN23.011
where:
r
Oil
= density of the specific test oil, mg/mL and
V
Oil
= Volume (mL of oil added to test flask (100 µL = 0.1 mL))
2.8.4 The %ODs for the six replicates within a particular treatment are then subjected to an outlier test, the Grubb's Test or Maximum Normal Residual test (6). A convenient internet-based calculator of a Grubbs outlier may be found at:
http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/Grubbs1.cfm.
If an outlier is detected (p
0.05), analyze an additional replicate to obtain the required six replicates.
2.8.5 Report the Dispersion Efficacy value for each oil and each temperature, which is the lower 95% confidence level of the 6 independent replicates (DE
LCL95
) for each oil/temperature combination. Error bars are not needed as reporting the lower confidence level computationally takes the variability of the replicates into account as shown in Equation 9 of this Appendix.
ER28JN23.012
where (%OD)
(%OD) = mean percentage oil dispersed for the n = 6 replicates, S = standard deviation, and t
(n-1,1-
α
)
= 100 * (1-α)th percentile from the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. For 6 replicates, t
n-1,1-

= 2.015, where α = 0.05. An example of the calculations is given in Table 5 of this Appendix.

Quality Control (QC) Procedures for Oil Concentration Measurements
2.10.1
Absorbance readings.
Perform at least 5% of all UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements in duplicate as a QC check on the analytical measurement method. The absorbance values for the duplicates must agree within ±5% of their mean value.
2.10.2
Method blanks.
Analytical method blanks involve an analysis of artificial seawater blanks (artificial seawater without oil or dispersant in a baffled flask) through testing and analytical procedures. Analyze method blanks with a frequency of at least two per completed test. Oil concentrations in method blanks must be less than detectable limits.
2.10.3
Accuracy.
Determine accuracy by using a mid-point standard calibration check after each set of replicate samples analyzed. The acceptance criterion is based on a percent recovery of 90-110% using the following equation:
ER28JN23.013
2.10.4 Calibration
QC checks.
Before analyzing samples, the spectrophotometer must meet an instrument stability calibration criterion using the oil standards. The instrument stability for initial calibration is acceptable when the RFs (Equation 5 of this Appendix) for each of the six standard concentration levels are less than 10% different from the overall mean value.

Preparation of Stock Solutions
3.2.1
Dispersant.
Prepare a 1000 µL/L primary stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of dispersant to 1100 mL of dilution water consisting of salinity adjusted uncontaminated natural or artificial seawater, in a glass vessel. Using a laboratory top stirrer equipped with a stainless-steel blade, center the stirrer blade in the mixing vessel one inch off the bottom. Initially mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five seconds at speeds of
10,000 rpm to avoid foaming. Thereafter, set the speed to provide a 70% vortex. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Suspend mixing of the stock solution after the removal of each aliquot. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 3.5 and 3.6 of this Appendix.
3.2.2
Dispersant-Reference Oil(s) Mixtures.
Use Strategic Petroleum Reserve Bryan Mound reference oil. To obtain this oil at no charge (except for a minimal shipping fee) see
https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/national-contingency-plan-subpart-j#howto.
Assessment of dispersant-reference oil mixture (DOM) toxicity is determined for each reference oil using the aqueous phase of a chemically enhanced-water accommodated fraction (CE-WAF). Fit a glass aspirator bottle (approximately 23 L) equipped with a hose bib at the base with a length of silicon tubing containing a hose clamp. Fill the bottle with 19L of seawater leaving a 20% headspace above the liquid, place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar. Add the reference oil at 25 g/L using a silicon tube attached to a glass funnel that reaches just below the water surface. Using this method reduces the production of air bubbles on the oil surface slick. Adjust the stir plate to obtain an oil vortex of 25% of the total volume of the seawater, then add the dispersant to be tested at a ratio of 1:10 dispersant:oil (2.5 g/L). Securely seal the bottle to reduce the loss of volatiles using a silicon stopper and wraps of Parafilm and stir for 18 hours, then allow the solution to settle for 6 hours. Maintain the temperature at 25 °C during stirring and settling. Purge the hose at the base of the bottle of any material followed by removal of the CE-WAF (aqueous phase) into a clean glass container without disturbing the surface oil slick. The CE-WAF should be remixed and 1 to 2 L removed for chemical analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) following the procedures outlined in section 3.4 of this Appendix. The remaining volume will be used for the preparation of exposure solutions following procedures outlined in section 3.3 of this Appendix. To reduce time and cost, mix sufficient amounts of dispersant product-reference oil mixture CE-WAF to allow preparation of exposure solutions for conducting simultaneous acute tests with both
Americamysis bahia
and
Menidia beryllina.
3.3
Preparation of Exposure Concentrations.
3.3.1
Concentration Selection.
Preliminary rangefinder tests may be necessary using a series of logarithmic concentrations (
e.g.
0.1, 1, 10, 100 µl dispersant product/L or mg TPH/L) to determine the appropriate exposure concentration range necessary to determine LC
50
values and 95% confidence intervals. For definitive tests, conduct a minimum of five test concentrations using a geometric ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 (
e.g.
2, 4, 8, 16, and 32). Note that when testing only the dispersant product, the highest test concentration must not exceed the dispersant's self-dispersibility limit.
3.3.2
Exposure Concentrations.
Exposure solutions are prepared by adding the appropriate amount of stock solution directly to dilution water in each test chamber. Mix each exposure solution using five rotations in one direction followed by five rotations in the opposite direction using a solid glass stir rod.
3.3.3
Reference Toxicants.
Separate toxicity tests must be performed with a reference toxicant for each species tested. Conduct additional reference toxicity tests any time a change in the population or source of a test species occurs. Use sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), also known as dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as the reference toxicant for exposures conducted with
Menidia beryllina
and
Americamysis bahia.
Use copper chloride as the reference toxicant for exposures conducted with the sea urchin developmental test. Use reagent grade quality SDS and copper chloride for tests. Information on procedures for conducting reference toxicant tests with these species can be found in the specific EPA methods documents cited in sections 3.5.1, 3.6.1, and 3.7.1 of this Appendix.
3.4
Chemical Analysis of Stock Solutions.
Add the 1 L sample of CE-WAF (Section 3.2.2 of this Appendix) solutions directly to amber glass bottles with Teflon®-lined cap. Collect a replicate sample in the event of accidental loss or if reanalysis of the stock solution becomes necessary. Adjust sample to a pH=2 using 50% hydrochloric acid, immediately refrigerate and analyze within 48 hours of collection. Analyze samples for C9-C32 TPH by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) following EPA SW-846, Method 8015B-DRO (4). Report TPH concentration of stock solutions as milligrams TPH/L and use in the calculation of exposure concentrations for all toxicity tests conducted with CE-WAF.
3.5
Static Acute Tests with M. beryllina and A. bahia
3.5.1
General.
Use EPA's
Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms
(EPA-821-R-02-012) (1) for testing each species separately with dispersant product or a mixture of dispersant product and reference oil (DOM).
3.5.2
Test Solutions.
Modify procedures in EPA-821-R-02-012 specifically dealing with the handling and toxicity testing of effluents or receiving water samples as follows: Prepare stock solutions following section 3.2 of this Appendix and exposure concentrations following section 3.3 of this Appendix.
3.5.3
Number of Treatments, Replicates and Organisms.
Conduct a minimum of three replicates of at least five exposure treatments plus a minimum of three replicate dilution water controls. Expose ten organisms per replicate treatment.
3.5.4
Exposure Period.
Test duration is 48-hr for
Americamysis bahia
and 96-hr for
Menidia beryllina.
Mortality must be recorded at each 24-hour period of each test.
3.5.5
Test Acceptability.
For each test performed, survival of control animals must be
90% and test results must allow determination of statistically valid LC
50
and 95% confidence interval values except in cases where the LC
50
is
1000 µl/L or is determined to be greater than the limits of water solubility of dispersibility.
3.5.6
Static Acute Test Summary.
A summary of required test conditions is provided in Table 7 of this Appendix.
3.6
Sea Urchin Developmental Test with Dispersant Product
3.6.1
General.
Use Section 15, “Purple Urchin,
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
and Sand Dollar,
Dendraster excentricus
Larval Development Test Method” of EPA's
Short-Term Methods for Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to West Coast Marine and Estuarine Organisms
(EPA/600/R-95-136) (2). Alternatively, the development of the urchin
Arbacia punctulata
may be tested (see Table 7).
3.6.2
Test Organism.
Tests of dispersant products are to follow methods for the purple urchin only. Tests with the sand dollar are not required.
3.6.3
Test Solutions.
Modify procedures in EPA/600/R-95-136, Section 15 specifically dealing with the handling and toxicity testing of effluents or receiving water samples as follows: Prepare stock solutions following section 3.2.1 of this Appendix and exposure concentrations following section 3.3 of this Appendix.
3.6.4
Number of Treatments and Replicates.
Conduct a minimum of four replicates of five exposure treatments plus a minimum of four replicate dilution water controls.
3.6.5
Exposure Duration and Test Endpoint.
Examine the effects of the dispersant product on normal development of sea urchin embryos over a period of 72 hours. An IC
50
(the exposure concentration at which normal development is inhibited in 50% of the embryos) with 95% confidence intervals are to be determined in place of an IC
25.
The concentration of dispersant causing inhibition of development in 50% of exposed embryos (IC
50
) with the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals (LCI
95
and ULCI
95
) must be calculated at the end of the exposure period. Mortality determinations are not required.

Dilution Water.
Use Section 7 of EPA's
Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms
(EPA-821-R-02-012) [1] for preparation of the appropriate dilution water for each species tested. Use of clean natural or synthetic seawater for tests conducted with saltwater species is acceptable.
4.3
Preparation of Stock Solutions.
4.3.1 Liquid
Surface Washing Agents and/or Herding Agents.
Prepare a 1000 µL/L stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of test product to 1100 mL of dilution water in a glass vessel. Place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar and adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total volume of the liquid. Mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five minutes at room temperature. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 4.6 and/or 4.7 of this Appendix, as appropriate.
4.3.2
Bioremediation Agents.
For products consisting of two or more liquid and/or solid components, prepare the product following the manufacturers recommended procedure and ensure the test product mixture is completely blended. Prepare a 1000 µL/L stock solution prior to test initiation by adding 1.1 mL of the test product mixture to 1100 mL of dilution water in a glass vessel. Place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar and adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total volume of the liquid. Mix the resulting stock solution for approximately five minutes at room temperature. Using a glass pipette, remove appropriate aliquots of stock solution from between the mixing vessel wall and edge of the vortex and place directly into the dilution water within an exposure vessel. Base the preparation of exposure solutions on the nominal concentration of the stock solution and follow procedures outlined in sections 4.5 and/or 4.6 of this Appendix, as appropriate.
4.3.3
Solid Phase Products.
Assessment of the toxicity of solidifiers and other solid phase products are determined using the aqueous phase of water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of the test product. Fit a glass aspirator bottle (approximately 23L) equipped with a hose bib at the base with a length of silicon tubing containing a hose clamp. Fill the bottle with 19L of dilution water leaving a 20% headspace above the liquid, place on a magnetic stir plate then add and center a stir bar. Add the test product at 25 g/L and securely seal the bottle using a
silicon stopper and wraps of parafilm. Adjust the stir plate to obtain a vortex of 25% of the total fluid volume, stir for 18 hours then settle for 6 hours. Maintain the temperature at 25 °C during stirring and settling. Purge the hose at the base of the bottle of any material followed by removal of the WAF (aqueous phase) into a clean glass container without disturbing the product on the surface. The WAF should be remixed and used for the preparation of exposure solutions following procedures outlined in section 4.4 of this Appendix.
4.4
Preparation of Exposure Concentrations.
4.4.1
Concentration Selection.
Preliminary rangefinder tests may be necessary using a series of logarithmic concentrations (
e.g.
0.1, 1, 10, 100 µl test product/L) to determine the appropriate exposure concentration range necessary to determine LC
50
values and 95% confidence intervals. For definitive tests, conduct a minimum of five test concentrations using a geometric ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 (
e.g.
2, 4, 8, 16, and 32). Note that when testing the product, the highest test concentration should not exceed the test product's self-dispersibility limit.
4.4.2
Exposure Concentrations.
Exposure solutions are prepared by adding the appropriate amount of stock solution directly to dilution water in each test chamber. Mix each exposure solution using five rotations in one direction followed by five rotations in the opposite direction using a solid glass stir rod.
4.4.3
Reference Toxicants.
Separate toxicity tests must be performed with a reference toxicant for each species tested. Conduct additional reference toxicity tests any time a change in the culture population or source of a test species occurs. Use reagent grade quality sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), also known as dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as the reference toxicant. Information on procedures for conducting reference toxicant tests with these species can be found in section 4 of EPA's
Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms

Bioremediation Agent Efficacy Test Protocol
5.1
Summary.
This protocol quantifies changes in weathered Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil composition of alkanes and aromatics resulting from the use of a bioremediation agent in either artificial seawater or freshwater. The manufacturer may test either one or both freshwater or saltwater, depending on the product's intended use. Biodegradation of the alkanes and aromatics is monitored for 28 days at 20-23 °C. Product flasks at Day 28 are compared to Day 0 flasks to determine reductions in alkanes and aromatics. A positive control of a known oil-degrading bacterial consortium supplied by EPA is tested. A negative, sterile control is also set up containing exposure
water, weathered crude oil, product, and a sterilant, sodium azide. The purpose of the negative, killed control is to make sure the disappearance of the oil constituents at day 28 is due to biodegradation and not some physical loss such as volatilization. The day 28 GC/MS results from the killed control must not be less than 90% of the day 0 results. The sample preparation procedure extracts the oil phase into the solvent dichloromethane (DCM) (also known as methylene chloride) with a subsequent solvent exchange into hexane. The hexane extracts are analyzed by a high-resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) operated in the selected ion monitoring mode (SIM) at a scan rate of
5 scans per second.
Note to 5.1:
Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil is artificially weathered by distillation at 521 °F (272 °C) to remove the low molecular weight hydrocarbons to approximate natural weathering processes that occur after a spill.

5.4.3 Aseptically dispense 100 mL of pre-sterilized artificial exposure water (seawater or freshwater) into each sterile flask. For the positive control flasks, use exposure water containing nutrients.
5.4.4 Tare the labeled flasks containing exposure water and other additions, as necessary, on the balance with a minimum accuracy of 0.01 g. Add drop-wise 0.50 g oil (this results in a final oil concentration of 5 g/L) using a sterile Pasteur pipette to the center of the flask taking care to avoid splashing the oil onto the sides of the flasks. Record the precise weight. ANS521 may be previously warmed in a hot water bath at 60 °C for 40-60 minutes to facilitate its flow. Take precautions when handling and charging the flasks to minimize the likelihood of contamination by exogenous microbes, including using a new sterile pipette for each series of flasks.
5.4.5 Preparation of the EPA consortium for both the positive control flasks and the flasks containing non-living bio-stimulation products. Use the supplied vials containing approximately 5 mL of the known EPA consortium frozen in glycerol. Thaw the supplied vials at room temperature (
do not allow cultures preserved in glycerol to sit at room temperature past thawing
), transfer the contents of the thawed vials to a single sterile centrifuge tube, rinse tubes with two volumes each of sterile exposure water, centrifuge at between 6,000- and 7,000-times gravity (6,000-7,000 ×
g
) for 15 minutes using a fixed rotor to fully pellet the cells. Carefully resuspend the cell pellet in sterile exposure water using the appropriate volume to achieve the desired seeding density, which will be provided by EPA upon shipment of the consortium.
5.4.6 Positive control flasks contain exposure water, oil, nutrients, and the EPA consortium.
5.4.7 Negative killed control flasks for all products shall contain exposure water, oil, product, the EPA consortium for products not containing a living culture, and the sodium azide sterilant at a final concentration of 0.5 g/L. Add the sodium azide sterilant prior to adding any product or EPA consortium. For the negative killed control flasks and product flasks, prepare and add the product to the flasks in a concentration specified by the manufacturer or vendor.
5.4.8 For non-living products that contain nutrient only, use the EPA consortium as the inoculum.
5.4.9 For other non-living products (
e.g.,
enzymes), do not add nutrients or the EPA consortium as the inoculum as they are not needed.
5.4.10 For products containing living microorganisms, prepare 6 flasks the same way as in Steps a-d, but without the EPA consortium. A product that contains its own nutrients must not be amended with nutrients, unless the product contains insufficient nutrients. Since this is a closed flask test, nutrients could be limiting if they are at the same concentration as used in the field. This could cause the product to fail the test. Thus, the manufacturer has the option to supplement its product with a higher concentration of nutrients than that contained in the product. Any nutrient supplements to a product must be reported and must not exceed the concentration limits in Table 10 (for seawater) and 13 (for freshwater) of this Appendix, as applicable.
5.4.11 Cap all flasks either with sterile cotton stoppers or loosely applied aluminum foil to allow gas exchange with the atmosphere. Set aside the T = 0 flasks for immediate extraction and analysis. Place the rest of the flasks onto the orbital shaker table. Do not tip the flasks excessively to avoid stranding oil above the mixing area of the flask. Set the orbital shaker to 200 rpm and shake the flasks for 28 days at 20-23 °C in the dark.
5.4.12 Submit all information on added microorganisms and nutrients for testing in the data report.
5.5
Sampling and Chemical Analysis.
5.5.1
Summary.
At each sampling event (Days 0 and 28), product and control flasks are sacrificed for analysis of residual oil concentrations (SOP 4 of this Appendix). Record all physical observations for each flask (such as degree of emulsification, whether the oil has congealed into tar balls, wall growth, color, etc.) at each sampling. The analytical procedure is summarized in Table 16 of this Appendix. Dichloromethane (DCM) is the solvent used for the initial extraction. Solvent-exchange the extract into hexane prior to injection into the gas chromatograph. The solvent exchange is done to prevent asphaltenes from contaminating the column.

5.5.2
Hydrocarbon Extraction.
To measure extraction efficiency, 200 µL of the 400 mg/L surrogate recovery standard (compounds and concentrations described in SOP 1 in this Appendix) is added to each flask. Add 50 mL DCM to each flask. Transfer the contents to a 250 mL separatory funnel and shake for 2 minutes; allow the phases to separate for 2 minutes. If an emulsion remains after 2 minutes, centrifuge the emulsion in Teflon® centrifuge tubes for at least ten minutes in a low-speed centrifuge at 3,000 times gravity (3,000 ×
g
) to break the emulsion and recover the DCM phase. Pass the DCM extract through a funnel plugged with glass wool and containing approximately 20 g anhydrous, granular sodium sulfate (Na
2
SO
4
) to remove water. Repeat the steps above two more times with 25 mL DCM each (100 mL DCM used in total). Add 10 mL DCM on to the sodium sulfate after the third extraction to rinse off any oil residue. Collect the extract in 125 mL serum vials, capped with Teflon lined septa and aluminum crimp seals, and store at 4 °C for up to 6 months.
5.5.3
Solvent Exchange.
Perform a solvent exchange (DCM to hexane) prior to GC/MS analysis to prevent injection of asphaltenes into the GC/MS column. Transfer the DCM extract to concentration tubes. Place the tubes in a 29 °C water bath under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Reduce the sample to 1 mL and transfer the extract to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Rinse the concentration tube with hexane and add it to the volumetric flask 2 times. Adjust the final volume with hexane to 10 mL.
5.5.4
Hydrocarbon Analysis.
Quantify the concentrations of 25 alkanes, 32 aromatics and hopane (SOP 4, Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix) using an Agilent 6890 GC/5973 MS or equivalent equipped with a 30-m × 0.25-mm ID × 0.25-µm film thickness DB-5 or equivalent fused silica column. To prepare the samples, transfer 1.0 mL of the hexane extract into a 2 mL autosampler vial with Teflon lined cap. Add 20 µL of internal standard solution to each vial with a syringe or positive displacement pipettor. SOP 2 of this Appendix outlines the procedure for preparing the internal standard solution. Load vials onto the autosampler tray and analyze in selected ion monitoring mode (SIM). Sum the individual alkane concentrations for the total alkane concentration and the individual aromatic concentrations for total aromatic concentrations in each flask.
5.6
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC).
5.6.1
Objectives.
The critical variables to be analyzed for each set of experimental conditions are the individual petroleum hydrocarbons,
i.e.,
the alkanes ranging in carbon number from nC-14 to nC-35, plus pristane and phytane, and the 2- to 4-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologs as listed in SOP 4 of this Appendix. The quality assurance objectives for precision, accuracy, and detection limits are ±20%, 75-125% recovery, and 22.5 µg/L on average for the 58 compounds, respectively. For more details, refer to the SOPs of this Appendix.
5.6.2
Precision Objectives.
Precision is presented as relative percent difference (RPD) for duplicate measurements and as relative standard deviation (RSD, or coefficient of variance) for triplicate measurements, applicable to replication of treatments as separate samples.
5.6.3
Accuracy Objectives.
These are based on the check standards and standard oil samples run concurrently with the sample analyses for GC/MS analysis of critical compounds. Critical compounds in the check standards and in the oil standards must fall within 75-125% of expected values for the analysis to be valid. Six surrogate compounds (SOP 1 of this Appendix) added to each sample before extraction can also serve as a surrogate for determining accuracy. The measured surrogate concentrations must fall within 75-125% of expected values.
5.6.4
Calibration Range.
Conduct all measurements within the linear calibration range of the instrument. The calibrated concentration range for GC/MS analysis is 0.1 mg/L to 30 mg/L. If the measured concentration of any critical compound is above the calibration range, dilute the sample and re-analyze to quantify that particular compound within the linear calibration range.
5.6.5
Quality Control.
Table 17 of this Appendix summarizes the QC checks for each measurement. See the corresponding SOP in this Appendix for detailed descriptions of QC checks, frequency, acceptance criteria, and corrective actions.

Pass/Fail Criteria.
5.7.1 Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the hopane-normalized total aromatics (sum of all resolved aromatics) and hopane-normalized total alkane concentrations (sum of all resolved alkanes) from the 6 independent replicates at days 0 and 28. To normalize, divide the sum of the alkane analytes and the sum of the aromatic analytes in each replicate by the hopane concentration in the corresponding replicate.
5.7.2 From those data, calculate the 95% Upper Confidence Level (UCL95) at days 0 and 28 using the following formula (Equation 11 of this Appendix):
ER12JN23.089
where:
x

s = the standard deviation of the 6 replicates at day 0 and 28, and
n = no. of replicates = 6.
5.7.3 Using Equation 12 of this Appendix, calculate the % reduction of each oil fraction from day 0 to day 28, using the day 0 and 28 UCL
95
hopane-normalized values for each fraction:
ER12JN23.090

t

UCL95)
= UCL
95
of the hopane-normalized total alkane or total aromatic mean of 6 replicates on day 0.
5.7.4 A product is successful in saltwater or freshwater if the % reduction of total alkanes (aliphatic fraction) from the GC/MS analysis is greater than or equal to 85% and the % reduction of total aromatics (aromatic fraction) is greater than or equal to 35% at day 28 based on the UCL
95
(Equation 12 of
this Appendix). The benchmark reduction ranges in aliphatic and aromatic fractions for the positive control are the same as for the products specified above. The average concentration of the biomarker hopane at day 28 must not differ from the average concentration at day 0 by more than 12% in the positive control. If the conditions for the positive control are not met, the entire procedure must be repeated.
5.8
Data Verification and Reporting.
GC/MS data files are generated by MS ChemStation software (the Agilent standard software for GC/MS) or equivalent for each injection. Data files contain summed ion chromatograms and selected ion chromatograms. Calibration curves are generated within MS ChemStation software, and all data files are calculated against the calibration curve by MS ChemStation. Data verification would be done by crosschecking between analysts for 10% of the raw data and its reduction process.
5.9
Laboratory Report.
The summary of findings from a product test must include the data listings for each analyte that was analyzed (
i.e.,
all individual alkanes and aromatics in the list of required analytes), along with QA/QC checks (see Table 17) and instrument detection/reporting limits for each analyte. Express all concentrations as mg analyte/L exposure water.

If the measured value does not fall within this range, prepare and measure another independent surrogate solution. If the measured concentration of the second surrogate solution is within the allowable tolerance range, the calibration and instrument conditions are acceptable; properly discard the first surrogate solution. If the concentration of the second surrogate solution is also out of range, then clean and recalibrate the instrument until the problem is resolved.

Procedure for Working Standards and Check Standards:
5.10.3.2.1 Label three 5 mL volumetric flasks as STD30, STD20, STD10, and two 10 mL volumetric flasks as STD5, and STD5-utility.
5.10.3.2.2 Add 1-2 mL of DCM to each volumetric flask.
5.10.3.2.3 Using glass syringes, add the appropriate volume of stock solution A (as listed in Table SOP 3.1 of this Appendix) to the flasks labeled STD30, STD20, STD10, STD5, and STD5-utility.
5.10.3.2.4 Wash the walls of the inner neck of the flasks with several drops of DCM to rinse off the residue of the stock solution into the flasks.
5.10.3.2.5 Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 to dispense stock solutions B-E (do not add stock solution F, internal standard solution, at this step).
5.10.3.2.6 Dilute to volume with DCM for all the above flasks, seal with glass stoppers, and invert several times to homogenize the solutions.
5.10.3.2.7 Label three additional 10 mL volumetric flasks as STD2.5, STD1, and STD0.1. Wet with 1-2 mL DCM.
5.10.3.2.8 Dispense 5 mL of STD5-utility solution into flask STD2.5, 2 mL of STD5-utility solution into flask STD1, and 0.2 mL of STD5-utility solution into flask STD0.1.
5.10.3.2.9 Dilute to volume with DCM, seal with glass stoppers, and invert several times to homogenize the solutions.
5.10.3.2.10 Using a 100 µL glass syringe, dispense 100 µL of internal standard solution into flasks STD30, STD20, and STD10. Dispense 200 µL into flasks STD5, STD2.5, STD1, and STD0.1 to give a final concentration of 10 mg/L internal standard.
5.10.3.2.11 Seal with glass stoppers, and invert the flasks several times to homogenize the solutions.
5.10.3.2.12 Transfer the solutions into 2 mL storage vials, and cap with Teflon-lined caps.
5.10.3.1.13 Label each vial with date of preparation, analyst, sample names, and concentrations.
5.10.3.2.14 Weigh each storage vial and record its weight on the label. This weight is used to monitor possible evaporation during storage.
5.10.3.2.15 Store this solution at 0 °C or below.
5.10.3.2.16 Before using, allow the solution to come to room temperature, and shake it well.
5.10.3.2.17 Weigh the vial before opening, and compare the weight with the last weight recorded on the vial. If the weights are consistent, the integrity of the solution can be assumed. If not, investigate and resolve the cause. Do not use the solution if the integrity has been compromised.
5.10.3.3
Procedure for Oil Standard.
In a 100 mL volumetric flask, weigh 0.500 g of the standard ANS521 crude oil, add 2 mL of surrogate solution (see SOP 1 of this Appendix), and bring to volume with DCM. Add 2 mL of internal standard solution (see SOP 2 of this Appendix). Follow steps 5.10.3.2.11 through 5.10.3.2.17 of this SOP, substituting 40 mL storage vials for the 2 mL vials.
5.10.3.4
Quality Control/Quality Assurance:
5.10.3.4.1 Run the seven standard solutions using the GC/MS method (SOP 4) on a tuned GC/MS.

Instrument Specifications:
5.10.4.1.1 Use an Agilent 6890 GC coupled with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector (MSD) and an Agilent 6890 series auto sampler or equivalent, equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm I.D., and 0.25 µm film thickness) or equivalent, and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode. Data acquisition occurs in the SIM (selected ion monitoring) mode for quantitative analysis. In SIM mode, the dwell time of each ion is set to be 10 milliseconds and the ions are split up into groups by retention time. One way to divide the ions is by retention time grouping as shown in Table SOP 4.1 of this Appendix. The number of ions in each ion group must be constant, yielding the same scan rate for each group.

5.10.4.2
Procedure for preparing the instrument:
5.10.4.2.1 Lower the injection port temperature and the oven temperature to 50 °C or less to avoid oxidation of the column.
5.10.4.2.2 Replace the liner with a clean, silanized liner. Do not touch the liner with bare fingers. A small piece of muffled glass wool may be inserted to protect the column.
5.10.4.2.3 Return the injection port and oven to the appropriate temperatures.
5.10.4.2.4 Wait five minutes after the temperature equilibrates before using the instrument.
5.10.4.3
Procedure for tuning the MSD:
5.10.4.3.1 Perform an air/water check. The value reported for the relative abundance of water (m/z 18), nitrogen (m/z 28), oxygen (m/z 32), or carbon dioxide (m/z 44) shall be less than 5% of the base peak for the system to be considered leak free and are expected to be closed to 1% for a stable system.
5.10.4.3.2 Tune the MSD using the Standard Autotune program and the decafluorotriphenylphosphine (DFTPP) Tune program to reduce instrument variability. The Autotune report file is referenced by the instrument when performing an air/water check and thus must be run at least once per month. Run standards and samples using DFTPP Tune parameters, and retune the instrument using DFTPP Tune at least once per week. The tune programs use three fragment ions of perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) as a standard for tuning: m/z 69, 219, and 502. Tune reports must meet the following criteria:
5.10.4.3.2.1 Symmetrical peaks;
5.10.4.3.2.2 Mass assignments within ±0.2 amu's from 69, 219, and 502;
5.10.4.3.2.3 Peak widths within 0.5 ± 0.1 amu's;
5.10.4.3.2.4 Relative abundance is 100% for ion 69, at least 35% for ion 219, and at least 1% for ion 502;
5.10.4.3.2.5 Relative abundances for isotope masses 70, 220, and 503 ± 0.2 amu's are 0.5-1.5%, 2-8%, and 5-15%, respectively; and
5.10.4.3.2.6 Air and water peaks at m/z = 18, 28, 32, and 44 amu's must be very small and consistent with historical values.
5.10.4.4
Maintaining a log book.
Maintain an instrument log book, and make entries for each use. Include the following information in the logbook: operator name, helium cylinder tank pressure and outlet pressure, vacuum gauge reading, any maintenance performed on the instrument (such as changing
the injection port liner, gold seal, guard column, source cleaning), sequence name, data path, samples in order of injection, method information, GC column number, and the Standard Auto Tune report and DFTPP Tune report.
5.10.4.5
Running a Solvent Blank:
Following a liner change or at the start of a new run, run an injection of a pure solvent to confirm that the system is free of excessive or interfering contamination. Analyze the solvent in SCAN mode using the same temperature program used for sample analysis. If contamination is present, analyze additional samples of fresh solvent until the interfering contamination is removed.
5.10.4.6
Checking the DFTPP Tune:
Prior to running the first calibration standard, verify the instrument tune conditions by running a 10 ng/µL DFTPP check standard to check the mass measuring accuracy of the MS, the resolution sensitivity, the baseline threshold, and the ion abundance ranges. Run the standard using the DFTPP method provided with the instrument. Each of the criteria identified in Table SOP 4.2 of this Appendix must be met before using the instrument for analysis:

5.10.4.7 Calibrating
with a Multiple-Point Calibration Curve.
A 5- or 6-point calibration curve is obtained by running 5 or 6 working standards (see SOP 3) on the tuned GC/MS instrument. Calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for each compound relative to its corresponding deuterated internal standard as indicated in Table SOP 4.3 of this Appendix. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the RRFs for each compound must be less than 25%. Run an independently prepared check standard immediately after the calibration standards to validate the accuracy of the calibration curve.
5.10.4.8
Running Samples.
Once the calibration curve has been validated, samples can be analyzed. Dispense 1,000 µL of sample extract into labeled auto-sampler vials. Add 20 µL of the internal standard solution (see SOP 2 of this Appendix) to the extract using a syringe or a positive displacement pipettor. Run a check standard every 10 samples to ensure the consistency of the instrument. The RRF for each compound in the check standard must be within 25% of the average RRF obtained in the initial calibration.
5.10.4.9
Quantification:
Once a calibration table has been generated, quantify each data file using the “Calculate and Generate” function in the MS ChemStation software, or equivalent software. Review individual peak integration manually to ensure proper baseline integration. The quantification of a compound is based on the peak area of the primary ion (Q Ion) indicated in Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix.

5.10.4.10 Equation 14 of this Appendix is used to calculate the concentration of analytes in units of µg/g oil added:
ER12JN23.092
where:
A
analyte
= the peak area of the analyte,
C
istd
= the concentration of the internal standard,
A
istd
= the area of the internal standard,
RRF = the relative response factor, and
100 is the conversion factor to convert mg/L DCM to µg/g oil added.
5.10.4.11 If some analytes are not commercially available, the RRFs of other compounds (usually the parent compound) are used to quantify those analytes. For example, the RRF of C3-naphthalene may be used to calculate the concentrations of C3- and C4-naphthalenes. See Table SOP 4.4 of this Appendix for details. The quantification of these alkylated PAHs is relative because it is assumed that the molecular ions of the alkylated PAHs have the same RRFs as the parent compound ions. Nevertheless, these relative concentrations are useful for monitoring the fate of these compounds during the course of any analysis, as long as their concentrations are measured in a consistent way throughout the analysis.
5.10.4.12 Concentration calculations for all target compounds are performed using EnviroQuant software or equivalent. Data for each sample can be printed directly using a customized report template. Data can also be automatically entered into a spreadsheet within the EnviroQuant software.
5.10.5
Quality Assurance/Quality Control.
The following criteria must be met before any samples are analyzed:
5.10.5.1 Air/water check to verify the system is leak free.
5.10.5.2 AutoTune and DFTPP Tune pass all criteria.
5.10.5.3 DFTPP check standard passes all criteria.
5.10.5.4 Solvent blank scan indicates the GC/MS system is free of interfering contamination.
5.10.5.5 Prepare and monitor a control chart of a standard oil analysis. Concentrations of the analytes in the control chart must be no more than 25% different from their historical averages.
5.10.5.6 Relative response factors for analytes in the check standards inserted between every 10 samples must be no more than 25 percent different from the average RRF of those same analytes in the calibration curve. Peak shapes must be symmetrical.

The numbers under the column headed “CASRN” are the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers for each hazardous substance. CASRNs are unique numeric identifiers for specific substances. CASRNs are updated by the Chemical Abstract Service and are sometimes deleted or replaced. This list of CERCLA hazardous substances relies on information provided in the statutory lists that comprise the table. CASRNs are provided for convenience only to aid in the identification of the designated hazardous substance. Some CASRNs are given only for parent compounds. In some cases, a chemical name may have more than one CASRN associated with it due to the chemical's various forms; however, each CAS Registry Number is a unique numeric identifier and designates only one substance. That is, two substances, or two forms of a substance, do not have the same CAS Registry Number. If there is a discrepancy between the hazardous substance name and the listed CAS Registry Number, the hazardous substance names appearing in Table 302.4 should be used as the official means to determine if a given chemical or substance is reportable.

# Note II to Table 302.4
Hazardous substances are given a Statutory Code based on their statutory source. The “Statutory Code” column indicates the statutory source for designating each substance as a CERCLA hazardous substance. Statutory Code “1” indicates a Clean Water Act (CWA) Hazardous Substance [40 CFR 116.4; 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A)]. Statutory Code “2” indicates a CWA Toxic Pollutant [40 CFR 401.15, 40 CFR part 423 Appendix A, and/or 40 CFR 131.36; 33 U.S.C. 1317(a)]. Statutory Code “3” indicates a CAA HAP [42 U.S.C. 7412(b); Pub. L. 101-549 November 15, 1990; 70 FR 75047 December 19, 2005; 69 FR 69320 November 29, 2004; 61 FR 30816 June 18, 1996; 65 FR 47342 August 2, 2000; 87 FR 393 January 5, 2022]. Statutory Code “4” indicates Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Hazardous Wastes [40 CFR part 261 Subpart D—Lists of Hazardous Wastes; 42 U.S.C. 6921]. (Note: The “RCRA waste No.” column provides the waste identification numbers assigned by RCRA regulations). Statutory Code “5” indicates a hazardous substance designated under section 102(a) of CERCLA. The “Final RQ [pounds (kg)]” column provides the reportable quantity for each hazardous substance in pounds and kilograms.
