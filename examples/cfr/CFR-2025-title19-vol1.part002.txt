The quantity of the cargo laden aboard the conveyance must be provided. This means the quantity of the smallest external packing unit. Containers and pallets do not constitute acceptable information. For example, a container holding 10 pallets with 200 cartons should be described as 200 cartons. If the reported quantity is not correct or if it changes, the in-bond record must be updated or amended in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The updating of the quantity of the merchandise does not relieve the carrier whose bond is obligated from liquidated damages for any shortage.
(v)
Container number and seals.
The container number of the container in which the merchandise is being transported and the seal number of the seal that seals the container (see § 18.4) must be provided. If the seal number is not known when the in-bond application is filed, the in-bond application
must be updated with the seal number within two business days from the date the initial carrier takes possession of the sealed merchandise.
(vi)
Destination.
For IT shipments, the port of destination in the United States must be provided. For T
E and IE shipments, the port of exportation and the first foreign port must be provided. If any of this information changes, the in-bond record must be updated or amended in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(2)
Method of submission.
The in-bond application must be electronically transmitted to CBP via a CBP-approved EDI system, except as described in § 18.31 relating to the in-bond transportation of merchandise by pipeline, or air (see 19 CFR part 122) or under a TIR carnet (see 19 CFR part 115). In the event that EDI functionality is unavailable for filing an in-bond application, or any related in-bond filing, the Commissioner or his designee may authorize an alternative method.
(3)
Timing.
The in-bond application may be submitted at any time prior to the merchandise departing the origination port.
(e)
Bond required.
A custodial bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.63 of this chapter, is required in order to transport merchandise in-bond under the provisions of this part.
(f)
Movement authorization required.
Authorization from CBP is required before merchandise can be transported in-bond. Authorization for the movement of merchandise will be transmitted by CBP via a CBP-approved EDI system.
(g)
Supervision
—(1)
Generally.
When merchandise is delivered to a bonded carrier for transportation in-bond, CBP may, in its discretion, require that the merchandise be laden on the conveyance only under CBP supervision.
(2)
Merchandise delivered from warehouse.
When merchandise is delivered from a warehouse to a bonded carrier for transportation in-bond, supervision of lading will be accomplished in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 19.6(b) of this chapter.
(3)
Merchandise delivered from foreign trade zone.
When merchandise is delivered from a foreign trade zone to a bonded carrier for transportation in-bond, supervision of lading will be accomplished in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 146.71(a) of this chapter.
(h)
Updating and amending the in-bond record.
The filer of the in-bond application or any other party named in paragraph (c) of this section, with authorization of the party whose bond is obligated, must update and/or amend the in-bond record as required under the provisions of this part via a CBP-approved EDI system. The in-bond record must be updated or amended within two business days of the event that requires updating and/or amending of the in-bond record.
(i)
In-transit time
—(1)
Maximum in-transit time.
Except for merchandise to be transported via barge, merchandise to be transported in-bond must be delivered to CBP at the port of destination or port of exportation within 30 days from the date of conveyance arrival at the origination port (if the in-bond application has been received and approved prior to conveyance arrival), or the date CBP provides movement authorization to the in-bond applicant, whichever is later. Merchandise to be transported via barge for all or part of the in-bond movement, must be delivered to CBP at the port of destination or port of exportation within 60 days from the date of conveyance arrival at the origination port (if the in-bond application has been received and approved prior to conveyance arrival), or the date CBP provides movement authorization to the in-bond applicant, whichever is later. If the merchandise is subject to examination or inspection by CBP or another government agency, the time that the merchandise is held due to the examination or inspection will not be considered part of the 30-day or 60-day in-transit time. Neither the diversion to another port nor the filing of a new in-bond application extends the maximum in-transit time. Failure to deliver the merchandise within the prescribed period constitutes an irregular delivery. In-bond merchandise transported by pipeline is not subject to the time limits in this section.
(2)
Extension of in-transit time.
The in-transit requirement may be extended
by CBP upon a written request to the port director of the port of destination or port of exportation. The decision to extend the in-transit time period is within the discretion of CBP. Factors that may be considered, among any others deemed applicable by CBP, include extraordinary circumstances such as major transportation network disruptions, natural disasters, and other emergencies beyond the control of the party requesting the extension.
(3)
Restriction of in-transit time.
CBP or any other government agency with jurisdiction over the merchandise may shorten the in-transit time to less than 30 or 60 days. CBP will provide notice of a government-shortened in-transit time with the movement authorization.
(j)
Report of arrival.
Within two business days after the arrival of any portion of an in-bond shipment at the port of destination or the port of exportation, CBP must be notified via a CBP-approved EDI system that the merchandise has arrived. The notification must include the Facilities Information and Resources Management System (FIRMS) code of the location of the merchandise within the port. Failure to report the arrival or the FIRMS code for the physical location of the merchandise transported in-bond within the prescribed period constitutes an irregular delivery.
(k)
General order merchandise; exportation.
Any merchandise covered by an in-bond shipment that has arrived at the port of destination or the port of exportation must be entered, exported, or admitted to a foreign-trade zone pursuant to this part within 15 calendar days from the date of arrival of the entire in-bond shipment at the port of destination or port of exportation. Sixteen days after in-bond merchandise arrives in the port of destination or port of exportation, the merchandise will become subject to general order requirements pursuant to § 4.37, § 122.50, or § 123.10 of this chapter, as applicable.
(l)
Special classes of merchandise
—(1)
Health, safety and conservation.
CBP may determine that merchandise not in compliance with an applicable rule, regulation, law, standard or ban, relating to health, safety or conservation, will not be released for transportation in-bond without the authorization of the governmental agency administering such rule, regulation, law, standard or ban.
(2)
Plants and plant products.
Merchandise subject upon importation to examination, disinfection, or further treatment under the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine program, will only be released for transportation in-bond with the authorization of APHIS under regulations issued by that program. (See §§ 12.10 to 12.15 of this chapter).
(3)
Prohibited articles.
Articles prohibited admission into the commerce of the United States may not be entered for transportation in-bond. Any such merchandise offered for entry for that purpose may either be denied entry or be seized. However, CBP may permit exportation or transportation and exportation either with authorization from the governmental agency having regulatory authority over the prohibited articles or in compliance with the regulations of such agency.
(4)
Narcotics and other drugs, medicines, or chemicals
—(i)
Narcotics.
Narcotics prohibited admission into the commerce of the United States may not be entered for transportation in-bond and any such merchandise offered for entry for that purpose will be seized, except that exportation or transportation and exportation may be permitted with authorization from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and/or compliance with the regulations of the DEA.
(ii)
Other drugs, medicines, or chemicals.
Articles entered for transportation in-bond that are manifested merely as drugs, medicines, or chemicals, without evidence to satisfy the port director that they are non-narcotic, will be detained and subjected, at the carrier's risk and expense, to such examination as may be necessary to satisfy the port director that they are not of a narcotic character. A properly verified certificate of the shipper, specifying the items in the shipment and stating that they are not narcotic, may be accepted by the port director to establish the character of such a shipment.
(5)
Explosives.
Explosives may not be transported in-bond unless the importer has first obtained a license or permit from the proper governmental agency. In such case the explosives may be entered for immediate transportation, for transportation and exportation, or for immediate exportation as specified by the approving government agency. Governmental agencies with regulatory authority over explosives include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).
(6)
Livestock.
Carload shipments of livestock will not be entered for in-bond transportation unless they will arrive at the port of destination named in the in-bond application before it becomes necessary to remove the seals for the purpose of watering and feeding the animals, or unless the route is such that the removal of the seals and the watering, feeding, and reloading of the stock may be done under CBP supervision.
(m)
Divided shipments.
After reaching the destination port, the port to which the merchandise has been diverted under § 18.5(a), in-bond merchandise may be divided into multiple shipments with a portion of the initial in-bond shipment being entered for consumption or warehouse, and the remainder shipped under a new in-bond application. The carrier or any of the parties named in paragraph (c) of this section must, in accordance with the filing requirements of this section, submit a new in-bond application for each portion of the original shipment to be transported in-bond. Divided shipments for merchandise being transported under cover of a carnet are prohibited.
§ 18.2
Carriers, cartmen, and lightermen.
(a)
Transportation of merchandise in-bond by bonded carriers
—(1)
Generally.
Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, merchandise to be transported from one port to another in the United States in-bond must be delivered to a common carrier, contract carrier, freight forwarder, or private carrier, each of which must be bonded for that purpose. Such merchandise delivered to a bonded common carrier, contract carrier, or freight forwarder may be transported with the use of facilities of other bonded or non-bonded carriers; however, the responsibility for the merchandise will remain with the common carrier, contract carrier, or freight forwarder that obligated its bond for that purpose. Only vessels entitled to engage in the coastwise trade (see § 4.80 of this chapter) will be entitled to transport merchandise under this section.
(2)
Merchandise transported under a TIR carnet.
Merchandise to be transported from one port to another in the United States under cover of a TIR carnet (see part 114 of this chapter), except merchandise not otherwise subject to CBP control, as provided in §§ 18.41 through 18.45, must be delivered to a common carrier or contract carrier bonded for that purpose, but the merchandise thereafter may be transported with the use of other bonded or non-bonded common or contract carriers. The TIR carnet will be responsible for liability incurred in the carriage of merchandise under the carnet, and the carrier's bond will be responsible as provided in § 114.22(c) of this chapter.
(3)
Merchandise transported under an A.T.A. or a TECRO/AIT carnet.
Merchandise to be transported from one port to another in the United States under cover of an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet (see part 114 of this chapter) must be delivered to a common carrier or contract carrier bonded for that purpose, but the merchandise thereafter may be transported with the use of other bonded or non-bonded common or contract carriers. The A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet will be responsible for liability incurred in the carriage of merchandise under the carnet, and the carrier's bond will be responsible as provided in § 114.22(d) of this chapter.
(b)
Transportation of merchandise in-bond between certain ports by bonded cartmen or lighterman.
Pursuant to Public Resolution 108, of June 19, 1936, (19 U.S.C. 1551, 1551a) and subject to compliance with all other applicable provisions of this part, CBP, upon the request of a party named in § 18.1(c), may permit merchandise that has been entered and subject to CBP examination to be transported in-bond between the
ports of New York, Newark, and Perth Amboy, by bonded cartmen or lightermen duly qualified in accordance with the provisions of part 112 of this chapter, if CBP is satisfied that the transportation of such merchandise in this manner will not endanger the revenue and does not pose a risk to health, safety or security.
§ 18.3
Transfers.
(a)
Transfer to another conveyance.
Merchandise being transported in-bond may be transferred to another conveyance at any time. CBP notification is not required. The transfer to one or more conveyances will not extend the maximum in-transit time set forth in § 18.1(i).
(b)
Transfer to another bonded carrier.
Except as provided in § 18.31(d)(3), when merchandise is transferred to a bonded carrier that assumes the liability for the in-bond shipment, a report of arrival for the merchandise must be filed by the original bonded carrier and a new in-bond application must be filed by the subsequent bonded carrier pursuant to § 18.1.
(c)
Transfer of merchandise covered by a TIR Carnet generally prohibited.
Merchandise covered by a TIR carnet may not be transferred except in cases in which the unlading of the merchandise from a container or road vehicle is necessitated by casualty en route. In the event of transfer, a TIR approved container or road vehicle must be used if available. If the transfer takes place under CBP supervision, the CBP officer must execute a certificate of transfer on the appropriate TIR carnet voucher.
(d)
Transfer by bonded cartmen.
All transfers to or from the conveyance or warehouse of merchandise being transported in-bond must be made under the provisions of part 125 of this chapter and at the expense of the parties in interest, unless the bond of the carrier on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.63 of this chapter or a TIR carnet, is liable for the safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise while it is being transferred.
§ 18.4
Sealing conveyances, compartments, and containers.
(a)
Requirements, waiver, and TIR carnets
—(1)
Seals required.
Conveyance, compartments, or containers transporting in-bond merchandise must be sealed and the seals must remain intact until the merchandise arrives at the port of destination or the port of exportation. The seals to be used and the method for sealing conveyances, compartments, or containers must meet the requirements of §§ 24.13 and 24.13a of this chapter.
(2)
Waiver.
(i) CBP may waive the sealing of a conveyance, compartment, or container in which bonded merchandise is transported if CBP determines that the sealing of the conveyance, compartment, or container is unnecessary to protect the revenue or to prevent violations of the customs laws and regulations.
(ii) Examples of situations where CBP may waive the waiver of the sealing requirement are when the conveyance, compartment, or container cannot be effectively sealed, as in the case of merchandise shipped in open cars or barges or on the decks of vessels, when it is known that any seals would necessarily be removed outside the jurisdiction of the United States for the purpose of discharging or taking on cargo, or when it is known that the breaking of the seals will be necessary to ventilate the hatches.
(3)
TIR carnets.
The port director will cause a CBP seal to be affixed to a container or road vehicle that is being used to transport merchandise under cover of a TIR carnet unless the container or road vehicle bears a customs seal (domestic or foreign). The port director will likewise cause a CBP seal or label to be affixed to heavy or bulky goods being so transported. If, however, the port director has reason to believe that there is a discrepancy between the merchandise listed on the Goods Manifest of the carnet and the merchandise that is to be transported, the port director may cause a CBP seal or label to be affixed only when the listing of the merchandise in the carnet and a physical inventory agree.
(b)
Commingled merchandise
—(1)
Transported in a sealed conveyance, compartment, or container.
Merchandise
that is not covered by a bond may be transported in a sealed conveyance, compartment, or container that contains bonded merchandise if the merchandise is destined for the same or subsequent port as the bonded merchandise.
(2)
Transported in a conveyance, compartment, or container that is not sealed.
Merchandise that is not covered by a bond may be transported with bonded merchandise in a conveyance, compartment, or container that is not sealed, if the in-bond merchandise is corded and sealed, or affixed with a warning label or tag as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Warning label or tag
—(i)
Warning label.
The required warning label for in-bond merchandise described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, must be on bright red paper, not less than 5 by 8 inches in size, unless the size of the package renders the use of a 5 by 8 inch warning label impracticable because of lack of space; then a 3 by 5 inch label may be used. Alternatively, a high visibility, permanently affixed warning label, whether as a continuous series in tape form or otherwise, but not less than 1
1/2
by 3 inches, and not to be removed until the in-bond movement is completed, may be used on any size package. The warning label must contain the following words in black or white lettering of a conspicuous size:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
This package is under bond and must be delivered intact to the CBP officer in charge at the port of destination or to such other place as authorized by CBP.
Warning. Two years' imprisonment, a fine, or both, is the penalty for unlawful removal of this package or any of its contents.
(ii)
Tag.
When it is impossible to attach the warning label by pasting, a bright red shipping tag of convenient size, large enough to be conspicuous and containing the same legend as the label, shall be used in lieu of a label. Such tag shall be wired or otherwise securely fastened to the packages in such manner as not to damage the merchandise.
(4)
Merchandise transported under carnet.
Merchandise moving under cover of a carnet may not be consolidated with other merchandise.
(c)
Removal and replacement of seals.
If it becomes necessary at any point in transit to remove seals from a conveyance, compartment, or container containing bonded merchandise for the purpose of transferring its contents to another conveyance, compartment, or container, or to gain access to the shipment because of casualty or for other good reason, such as when required by law enforcement or another government agency, a responsible agent of the carrier may remove the seals, supervise the transfer or handling of the merchandise, and seal the conveyance, compartment, or container in which the shipment goes forward. Updated seal numbers must be transmitted to CBP pursuant to § 18.1(h) and general recordkeeping requirements under 19 CFR part 163 apply.
(d)
Containers or road vehicles accepted for transport under customs seal; requirements
—(1)(i)

(3)
CBP refusal.
The port director may refuse to accept for transport under customs seal a container or road vehicle bearing evidence of approval if, in the port director's opinion, the container or road vehicle no longer meets the requirements of the applicable Convention.
(4)
CBP acceptance for transport.
Containers or road vehicles that are not approved under the provisions of a Customs Convention may be accepted for transport under customs seal only if the port director at the origination port is satisfied that the container or road vehicle can be effectively sealed and no goods can be removed from or introduced into the container or road vehicle without obvious damage to it or without breaking the seal. A container or road vehicle so accepted shall not carry merchandise covered by a TIR carnet.
§ 18.5
Diversion.
(a)
Procedure.
In order to change the port of destination or the port of exportation of an in-bond movement, the filer of the in-bond application must submit a request to divert merchandise via a CBP-approved EDI system. Permission for the diversion and movement of merchandise will be transmitted via a CBP-approved EDI system. If the request to divert merchandise is denied, such merchandise must be delivered to the original port of destination or port of exportation that was named in the in-bond application. The decision to grant or deny permission to divert merchandise is within the discretion of CBP. Denials may result from, for example, restrictions placed upon the movement of goods by government agencies.
(b)
In-transit time.
The approval of a request to divert merchandise for transportation in-bond does not extend the in-transit time specified in § 18.1(i)(1) of this part. The diverted merchandise must be delivered to the port of diversion within the in-transit time specified in § 18.1(i)(1) from the date CBP first authorized the in-bond movement, unless an extension is granted pursuant to § 18.1(i)(2).
(c)
Diversion of cargo subject to restriction, prohibition or regulation by other federal agency or authority.
Merchandise subject to a law, regulation, rule, standard or ban that requires permission or authorization by another federal agency or authority before importation may be restricted from being diverted on behalf of the authorizing agency.
§ 18.6
Short shipments; shortages; entry and allowance.
(a)
Notification of short shipment.
When an in-bond shipment arrives at the port of destination or the port of exportation and the cargo covered by the original in-bond application is short, the arriving carrier must notify CBP of the shortage when submitting the notice of arrival via a CBP-approved EDI system.
(b)
New in-bond application required.
The carrier or any of the parties named in § 18.1(c) must, in accordance with the filing requirements of § 18.1, submit a new in-bond application to transport short shipped packages that have been located or recovered to the port of destination or port of exportation provided in the in-bond application. Reference must be made in the new in-bond application to the original transportation entry.
(c)
Demand for redelivery; entry.
When a shipment or a portion of a shipment is not delivered, or when delivery is to
an unauthorized location or is delivered to the consignee without the permission of CBP, CBP may demand return (redelivery) of the merchandise to CBP custody. The demand must be made no later than 30 days after the shortage, delivery, or failure to deliver is discovered by CBP. The demand for the redelivery of the merchandise to CBP custody must be made to the bonded carrier, cartman, or lighterman identified in the in-bond application. The demand for the redelivery of the merchandise will be made on CBP Form 4647, Notice of Redelivery, other appropriate form or letter, or by an electronic equivalent thereof. A copy of the demand or electronic equivalent thereof, with the date of mailing or delivery noted thereon, must be retained by the port director and made part of the in-bond entry record. Entry of the merchandise may be accepted if the merchandise can be recovered intact without any of the packages having been opened. In such cases, any shortage from the invoice quantity will be presumed to have occurred while the merchandise was in the possession of the bonded carrier.
(d)
Failure to redeliver; entry.
If the merchandise cannot be recovered intact, entry will be accepted in accordance with § 141.4 of this chapter for the full manifested quantity, unless a lesser amount is otherwise permitted in accordance with subpart A of part 158. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the merchandise is not returned to CBP custody within 30 days of the date of mailing of the demand for redelivery, if mailed, or within 30 days of the date of transmission, if transmitted by a method other than by mail, there shall be sent to the party whose bond is obligated on the transportation entry a demand for liquidated damages on CBP Form 5955-A. CBP will also seek the payment of duties, taxes, and fees, where appropriate, pursuant to § 18.8(c).
(e)
Failure to redeliver merchandise covered by a carnet.
If merchandise covered by a carnet cannot be recovered intact as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, entry will not be accepted; there will be sent to the appropriate guaranteeing association a demand for liquidated damages, duties, and taxes as prescribed in § 18.8(d); and, if appropriate, there will also be sent to the initial bonded carrier a demand for any excess, as provided in § 114.22(e) of this chapter. Demands must be made on the forms specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Allowance.
An allowance in duty on merchandise reported short at destination, including merchandise found by the appraising officer to be damaged and worthless, and animals and birds found by the discharging officer to be dead on arrival at destination, must be made in in accordance with law.
(g)
Rail and seatrain.
In the case of shipments arriving in the United States by rail or seatrain, which are forwarded under CBP in-bond seals under the provisions of subpart D of part 123 of this chapter, and § 18.11, or § 18.20, a notation must be made by the carrier or shipper in the in-bond application, to show whether the shipment was transferred to the car designated in the manifest and whether it was laden in the car in the foreign country. If laden on the car in a foreign country, the country must be identified in the notation.
§ 18.7
Lading for exportation; notice and proof of exportation; verification.
(a)
Exportation
—(1)
Notice.
Within two business days after the arrival at the port of exportation of any portion of an in-bond shipment, CBP must be notified via a CBP approved EDI of the arrival of the merchandise pursuant to § 18.1(j). Failure to report the arrival of bonded merchandise within the prescribed period will constitute an irregular delivery.
(2)
Time to export.
Within 15 calendar days after arrival of the last portion of a shipment arriving at the port of exportation under a transportation and exportation entry, the entire shipment of merchandise must be exported. On the 16th day the merchandise will become subject to general order requirements under § 4.37, § 122.50, or § 123.10 of this chapter, as applicable.
(3)
Notice and proof of exportation.
Within two business days after exportation, the in-bond record must be updated via a CBP approved EDI system to reflect that the merchandise has
been exported. The principal on any bond filed to guarantee exportation may be required by the port director to provide evidence of exportation in accordance with § 113.55 of this chapter.
(b)
Supervision.
The port director will require such supervision of the lading for exportation of merchandise covered by an entry or withdrawal for exportation or for transportation and exportation only as is reasonably necessary to satisfy the port director that the merchandise has been laden on the exporting conveyance.
(c)
Verification.
CBP may verify export entries and withdrawals against the records of the exporting carriers. Such verification may include an examination of the carrier's records of claims and settlement of export freight charges and any other records that may relate to the transaction. The exporting carrier must maintain these records for five years from the date of exportation of the merchandise.
§ 18.8
Liability for not meeting in-bond requirements; liquidated damages; payment of taxes, duties, fees, and charges.
(a)
Liability.
The party whose bond is obligated on the transportation entry will be liable for breach of any of the requirements found in this part, any other regulations governing the movement of merchandise in bond, and any of the other conditions specified in the bond. This includes, but is not limited to shortages, irregular delivery, or non-delivery, at the port of destination or port of exportation of the merchandise transported in-bond; the failure to export merchandise transported in bond pursuant to a transportation and exportation or immediate exportation entry; and, the failure to maintain intact seals or the unauthorized removal of seals. Appropriate commercial or government documentation may be provided to CBP as proof of delivery and/or exportation. Any loss found to exist at the port of destination or port of exportation will be presumed to have occurred while the merchandise was in the possession of the party whose bond was obligated under the transportation entry, unless conclusive evidence to the contrary is produced.
(b)
Liquidated damages.
(1) The party whose bond is obligated on the transportation entry is liable for payment of liquidated damages if there is a failure to comply with any of the requirements found in this part, any other regulations governing the movement of merchandise in bond, and any of the other conditions specified in the bond.
(2)
Petition for relief.
In any case in which liquidated damages are imposed in accordance with this section and CBP is satisfied by the evidence submitted with a petition for relief filed in accordance with the provisions of part 172 of this chapter that any violation of the terms and conditions of the bond occurred without any intent to evade any law or regulation, CBP may cancel such claim upon the payment of any lesser amount or without the payment of any amount as may be deemed appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances.
(c)
Taxes, duties, fees, and charges.
In addition to the liquidated damages described in paragraph (b) of this section, the party whose bond is obligated on the transportation entry will be liable for any duties, taxes, and fees accruing to the United States on the missing merchandise, together with all costs, charges, and expenses, caused by the failure to make the required transportation, report, delivery, entry and/or exportation. The amount of duties, taxes, fees, and charges owed to the United States under this paragraph is not limited to the amount of the bond obligated on the transportation entry.
(d)
Carnets
—(1)
TIR carnets.
(i) The domestic guaranteeing association will be jointly and severally liable with the initial bonded carrier for duties, taxes, and fees accruing to the U.S., and any other charges imposed, in lieu thereof, as the result of any shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery at the port of destination or port of exportation of merchandise covered by a TIR carnet. The liability of the domestic guaranteeing association is limited to $50,000 per TIR carnet for duties, taxes, and sums collected in lieu thereof. Penalties imposed as liquidated damages against the initial bonded carrier, and sums assessed against the guaranteeing association in lieu of duties and taxes for any shortage, irregular delivery, or
nondelivery will be in accordance with this section. If a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged subject to a reservation, the guaranteeing association will be notified within one year of the date upon which the carnet is taken on charge, including time for receipt of the notification, except that if the discharge was obtained improperly or fraudulently the period will be two years. However, in cases that become the subject of legal proceedings during the above-mentioned period, no claim for payment will be made more than one year after the date when the decision of the court becomes enforceable.
(ii) Within three months from the date demand for payment is made by the port director as provided by § 18.6(e), the guaranteeing association must pay the amount claimed, except that if the amount claimed exceeds the liability of the guaranteeing association under the carnet (see § 114.22(d) of this chapter), the carrier must pay the excess. The amount paid will be refunded if, within a period of one year from the date on which the claim for payment was made, it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of CBP that no irregularity occurred. CBP may cancel liquidated damages assessed against the guaranteeing association to the extent authorized by paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnets.
The domestic guaranteeing association is jointly and severally liable with the initial bonded carrier for pecuniary penalties, liquidated damages, duties, fees, and taxes accruing to the United States and any other charges imposed as the result of any shortage, irregular delivery, failure to comply with sealing requirements in this part, and any non-delivery at the port of destination or port of exportation of merchandise covered by an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet. However, the liability of the guaranteeing association must not exceed the amount of the import duties by more than 10 percent. If an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet is unconditionally discharged with respect to certain goods, the guaranteeing association will no longer be liable on the carnet with respect to those goods unless it is subsequently discovered that the discharge of the carnet was obtained fraudulently or improperly or that there has been a breach of the conditions of temporary admission or of transit. No claim for payment will be made more than one year following the date of expiration of the validity of the carnet. The guaranteeing association will be allowed a period of six months from the date of any claim by the port director in which to furnish proof of the reexportation of the goods or of any other proper discharge of the A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet. If such proof is not furnished within the time specified, the guaranteeing association must either deposit or provisionally pay the sums. The deposit or payment will become final three months after the date of the deposit or payment, during which time the guaranteeing association may still furnish proof of the reexportation of the goods to recover the sums deposited or paid.

(d)
Procedures when there is more than one carrier (i.e., transfer of the merchandise)
—(1)
Pipeline as initial carrier.

(c)
Port of exportation procedure.
At the port of actual exportation, the carnet and the container (or heavy or bulky goods) or road vehicle shall be presented to the port director who shall verify that seals or labels are intact and that there is no evidence of tampering.

§ 19.1
Classes of customs warehouses.
(a)
Classifications.
Customs warehouses shall be designated according to the following classifications:
(1)
Class 1.
Premises that may be owned or leased by the Government, when the exigencies of the service as determined by the port director so require, and used for the storage of merchandise undergoing examination by Customs, under seizure, or pending final release from Customs custody. Merchandise will be stored in such premises only at Customs direction and will be held under “general order.”
(2)
Class 2.
Importers' private bonded warehouses used exclusively for the storage of merchandise belonging or consigned to the proprietor thereof. A warehouse of class 4 or 5 may be bonded exclusively for the storage of goods imported by the proprietor thereof, in which case it shall be known as a private bonded warehouse.
(3)
Class 3.
Public bonded warehouses used exclusively for the storage of imported merchandise.
(4)
Class 4.
Bonded yards or sheds for the storage of heavy and bulky imported merchandise; stables, feeding pens, corrals, or other similar buildings or limited enclosures for the storage of imported animals; and tanks for the storage of imported liquid merchandise in bulk. If the port director deems it necessary, the yards shall be enclosed by substantial fences with entrances and exit gates capable of being secured
by the proprietor's locks. The inlets and outlets to tanks shall be secured by means of seals or the proprietor's locks.
(5)
Class 5.
Bonded bins or parts of buildings or of elevators to be used for the storage of grain. The bonded portions shall be effectively separated from the rest of the building.
(6)
Class 6.
Warehouses for the manufacture in bond, solely for exportation, of articles made in whole or in part of imported materials or of materials subject to internal-revenue tax; and for the manufacture for home consumption or exportation of cigars in whole of tobacco imported from one country.
(7)
Class 7.
Warehouses bonded for smelting and refining imported metal-bearing materials for exportation or domestic consumption.
(8)
Class 8.
Bonded warehouses established for the purpose of cleaning, sorting, repacking, or otherwise changing in condition, but not manufacturing, imported merchandise, under Customs supervision and at the expense of the proprietor.
(9)
Class 9.
Bonded warehouse, known as “duty-free stores”, used for selling, for use outside the Customs territory, conditionally duty-free merchandise owned or sold by the proprietor and delivered from the Class 9 warehouse to an airport or other exit point for exportation by, or on behalf of, individuals departing from the Customs territory for destinations other than foreign trade zones. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(8)(C), “Customs territory”, for purposes of duty-free stores, means the Customs territory of the U.S. as defined in § 101.1(e) of this chapter, and foreign trade zones (see part 146 of this chapter). All distribution warehouses used exclusively to provide individual duty-free sales locations and storage cribs with conditionally duty-free merchandise are also Class 9 warehouses.
(10) [Reserved]
(11)
Class 11.
Bonded warehouses, known as “general order warehouses,” established for the storage and disposition exclusively of general order merchandise as described in § 127.1 of this chapter.
(b)
Manipulation.
The whole or a part of any warehouse of class 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11 may be designated a constructive manipulation (class 8) warehouse when the exigencies of the service so require.
(c)
General order.
General order merchandise as described in § 127.1 of this chapter may be stored and disposed of in a class 11 warehouse or a warehouse of class 3, 4, or 5, provided the class 3, 4, or 5 warehouse has also been certified by the port director as meeting the criteria for a class 11 warehouse, following an application under § 19.2. So far as such warehouses are used for the purpose of handling general order goods, they will also be considered general order (class 11) warehouses. If there is no space at a warehouse of any of these classes available, the proprietor of such a warehouse, with the approval of the port director of the port nearest to where the warehouse is located, may rent or lease additional suitable premises for the storage of general order merchandise.
[T.D. 76-277, 41 FR 42649, Sept. 28, 1976, as amended by T.D. 82-204, 47 FR 49368, Nov. 1, 1982; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51254, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 92-81, 57 FR 37696, Aug. 20, 1992; T.D. 97-19, 62 FR 15834, Apr. 3, 1997; T.D. 02-65, 67 FR 68032, Nov. 8, 2002]

# General Provisions
§ 19.2
Applications to bond.
(a)
Application.
An owner or lessee desiring to establish a bonded warehouse facility shall make written application to the director of the port nearest to where the warehouse is located, describing the premises, giving its location, and stating the class of warehouse desired. If required by the port director, the applicant shall provide a list of names and addresses of all officers and managing officials of the warehouse and all persons who have a direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the warehouse facility. Except in the case of a class 2 or class 7 warehouse, the application shall state whether the warehouse facility is to be operated only for the storage or treatment of merchandise belonging to the applicant or whether it is to be operated as a public bonded warehouse. If the warehouse facility is to be operated as a private bonded warehouse, the application also shall state the general character of the merchandise to be
stored therein, and provide an estimate of the maximum duties and taxes which will be due on all merchandise in the bonded warehouse at any one time. A warehouse facility will be determined by street address, location, or both. For example, if a proprietor has two warehouses located at one street address and three warehouses located at three different street addresses the two located at one address would be considered as one warehouse facility and the three located at three different addresses would each be considered as separate warehouses facilities. The applicant must prepare and have available at the warehouse a procedures manual describing the inventory control and recordkeeping system that will be used in the warehouse. A certification by the proprietor that the inventory control and recordkeeping system meets the requirements of § 19.12 will be submitted with the application. The physical security of the facility must meet the approval of the port director.
(b) The applicant shall submit evidence of fire insurance coverage on the proposed warehouse. If the applicant does not have fire insurance for the proposed warehouse, he shall submit a certificate signed by an officer or agent of each of two insurance companies stating that the building is acceptable for fire-insurance purposes. The application shall also be accompanied by a blueprint showing measurements, openings, etc., of the building or space to be bonded. If the warehouse to be bonded is a tank, the blueprint shall show all outlets, inlets, and pipe liles and shall be certified as correct by the proprietor of the tank. A gauge table showing the capacity of the tank in United States gallons per inch or fraction of an inch of height, certified by the proprietor to be correct, shall accompany the application. When a part or parts of a building are to be used as the warehouse, there shall be given a detailed description of the materials and construction of all partitions. When the proprietor is the lessee of the premises covered by the application and bond, he shall furnish a stipulation concurred in by the sureties, agreeing that, prior to the expiration of the lease covering the premises without renewal thereof, he will transfer any merchandise remaining in the bonded warehouse to an approved bonded warehouse, pay all duties, charges, or exactions due on such merchandise, or otherwise dispose of such merchandise in accordance with the Customs laws and regulations. If the application is for a Class 9 warehouse (duty-free store), the applicant shall furnish the following documents:
(1) A map showing the location of the facilities to be bonded in respect to the port of entry and distances to all exit points of purchasers of conditionally duty-free merchandise;
(2) A description of the store's procedures, which includes inventory control, recordkeeping, and delivery methods. These procedures must be set forth in the proprietor's procedures manual. Such manual and subsequent changes therein must be furnished to the port director upon request. The procedures in the manual shall provide reasonable assurance that conditionally duty-free merchandise sold therein will be exported;
(3) If an airport duty-free store, a description of the store's procedures for restricting sales of conditionally duty-free merchandise to personal-use quantities; and
(4) A statement by an authorized official of the appropriate state, local or other governmental authority administering the exit point facility that the applicant duty-free store is authorized to deliver conditionally duty-free merchandise to purchasers at or through that exit point facility. A separate statement shall be required for each governments authority having jurisdiction over exit point facilities through which the duty-free store intends to deliver merchandise to purchasers. If the merchandise will be delivered through an exit point which is not under the jurisdiction of a governmental authority, the applicant will provide a statement to that effect.
(c) On approval of the application to bond a warehouse of any class, except class 1, a bond shall be executed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.63 of this chapter.
(d) An applicant desiring to establish a general order warehouse may need to
establish, as a condition of approval of the application, that the warehouse will meet minimum space requirements imposed by the port director to accommodate the storage of general order merchandise. Any space requirements will be posted by written notice at the customhouse and on the appropriate Customs-authorized electronic data interchange system. An applicant will not be subject to any minimum space requirements that are posted after the filing of his application.
(e) Any proprietor of a bonded warehouse may be required on 10 days' notice from the port director to furnish a new bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.63 of this chapter; and if he fails to do so, no more goods shall be sent to the warehouse and those therein shall be removed at the expense of such proprietor. A new bond is required if the bonded warehouse is substantially altered or rebuilt.
(f) As a condition of approval of the application, the port director may order an inquiry by a Customs officer into the qualification, character, and experience of the applicant (e.g. personal history, financial and business data, credit and personal references), and into the security, suitability, and fitness of the facility. The port director may require an individual applicant to submit fingerprints on form FD 258 or electronically at the time of filing the application, or in the case of applications from a business entity, may require the fingerprints, on form FD 258 or electronically, of all employees of the business entity.
(g) The port director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his decision to approve or deny the application to bond the warehouse. If the application is denied the notification shall state the grounds for denial. The decision of the port director will be the final Customs administrative determination in the matter.

(a)
Alterations or relocation.
Alterations to or relocation of a warehouse may be made with the permission of the director of the port nearest to where the facility is located.
(b)

Upon written application of the proprietor and upon the removal of all nonbonded goods, if any, the premises may again be used for the storage of bonded goods. If the application is approved, the port director shall indicate the approval by endorsement on the application. Rebonding will not be necessary as long as the original bond remains in force.
(c)
Discontinuance.
If a proprietor wishes to discontinue the bonded status of the warehouse, he shall make written application to the port director. The port director shall not approve the application until all goods in the warehouse are transferred to another bonded warehouse without expense to the Government.

The port director may make a written demand upon the proprietor to submit, within 30 days after the date of demand, a written list of the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of all persons employed by the proprietor in the carriage, receiving, storage, or delivery of any bonded merchandise. If a list has been previously furnished the proprietor shall advise the port director in writing of the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of any new personnel employed by him in the carriage, receiving, storage, or delivery of bonded merchandise within 10 days after such employment. For the purpose of this part a person shall not be deemed to be employed by a warehouse proprietor if he is an officer or employee of an independent contractor engaged by the warehouse proprietor to
load, unload, transport, or otherwise handle bonded merchandise.
(e)
Revocation or suspension for cause.
The port director may revoke or suspend for cause the right of a proprietor to continue the bonded status of the warehouse for any ground specified in this paragraph. An action to suspend or revoke the right to operate a bonded warehouse shall be taken in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. If the bonded status is revoked or suspended for cause, the port director shall require all goods in the warehouse to be transferred to a bonded warehouse without expense to the Government. The bonded status of a warehouse may be revoked or suspended for cause if:
(1) The approval of the application to bond the warehouse was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;
(2) The warehouse proprietor refuses or neglects to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relative to the operation or administration of a bonded warehouse;
(3) The warehouse proprietor or an officer of a corporation which has been granted the right to operate a bonded warehouse is convicted of or has committed acts which would constitute a felony, or a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer, (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;
(4) The warehouse proprietor does not provide secured facilities or properly safeguard merchandise within the bonded warehouse;
(5) The warehouse proprietor fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses, and other information required by § 19.3(d);
(6) The bond required by § 19.2(c) or (d) of this chapter is determined to be insufficient in amount or lacking sufficient sureties, and a satisfactory new bond with goods and sufficient sureties is not furnished within a reasonable time;
(7) Bonded merchandise has not been stored in the warehouse for a period of 2 year; or
(8) The warehouse proprietor or an employee of the warehouse proprietor discloses proprietary information in, or proprietary information contained on, documents to be included in the permit file folder to an unauthorized person.
(9) The proprietor of a Class 9 warehouse is or has been unable to provide reasonable assurance that conditionally duty-free merchandise is or was exported in compliance with the regulations of this part.
(f)
Procedure for revocation or suspension for cause.
The port director may at any time serve notice in writing upon any proprietor of a bonded warehouse to show cause why his right to continue the bonded status of his warehouse should not be revoked or suspended for cause. Such notice shall advise the proprietor of the grounds for the proposed action and shall afford the proprietor an opportunity to respond in writing within 30 days. Thereafter, the port director shall consider the allegations and responses made by the proprietor unless the proprietor in his response requests a hearing. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Customs or his designee within 30 days following the proprietor's request. The proprietor may be represented by counsel at such hearing, and all evidence and testimony of witnesses in such proceedings, including substantiation of the allegations and the responses thereto shall be presented, with the right of cross-examination to both parties. A stenographic record of any such proceeding shall be made and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the proprietor of the warehouse. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall promptly transmit all papers and the stenographic record of the hearing to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations or designee together with his recommendation for final action. The proprietor may submit in writing additional views or arguments to the Assistant Commissioner, Office
of Field Operations or designee following a hearing on the basis of the stenographic record, within 10 days after delivery to him of a copy of such record. The Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations or designee shall thereafter render his decision in writing, stating his reasons therefor. Such decision shall be served on the proprietor of the warehouse, and shall be considered the final administrative action.

§ 19.4
CBP and proprietor responsibility and supervision over warehouses.
(a)
Customs supervision.
The character and extent of Customs supervision to be exercised in connection with any warehouse facility or transaction provided for in this part shall be in accordance with § 101.2(c) of this chapter. Independent of any need to appraise or classify merchandise, the port director may authorize a Customs officer to supervise any transaction or procedure at the bonded warehouse facility. Such supervision may be performed through periodic audits of the warehouse proprietor's records, quantity counts of goods in warehouse inventories, spot checks of selected warehouse transactions or procedures or reviews of conditions of recordkeeping, storage, security, or safety in a warehouse facility.
(b)
Proprietor responsibility and supervision
—(1)
Supervision.
The proprietor shall supervise all transportation, receipts, deliveries, sampling, recordkeeping, repacking, manipulation, destruction, physical and procedural security, conditions of storage, and safety in the warehouse as required by law and regulations. Supervision by the proprietor shall be that which a prudent manager of a storage and manipulation facility would be expected to exercise.
(2)
Customs access.
The warehouse proprietor shall permit access to the warehouse and present merchandise within a reasonable time after request by any Customs officer.
(3)
Safekeeping of merchandise and records.
The proprietor is responsible for safekeeping of merchandise and records concerning merchandise entered in Customs bonded warehouses. The proprietor or his employees shall safeguard and shall not disclose proprietary information contained in or on related documents to anyone other than the importer, importer's transferee, or owner of the merchandise to whom the document relates or their authorized agent.
(4)
Records maintenance
—(i)
Maintenance.
The proprietor shall:
(A) Maintain the inventory control and recordkeeping system in accordance with the provisions of § 19.12 of this part;
(B) Retain all records required in this part and defined in § 163.1(a) of this chapter, pertaining to bonded merchandise for 5 years after the date of the final withdrawal under the entry; and
(C) Protect proprietary information in its custody from unauthorized disclosure.
(ii)
Availability.
Records shall be readily available for Customs review at the warehouse. In addition, a proprietor may keep records at another location for Customs review, but only if the proprietor first receives written approval for such storage from the port director.
(5)
Record retention in lieu of originals.
A warehouse proprietor may, in accordance with § 163.5 of this chapter, utilize alternative storage methods in lieu of maintaining records in their original formats.
(6)
Warehouse and merchandise security.
The warehouse proprietor shall maintain the warehouse facility in a safe and sanitary condition and establish procedures adequate to ensure the security of all merchandise under Customs custody stored in the facility. The warehouse construction will be a factor that will be considered by the port director in deciding whether to approve the application. The facility
shall be built in such a manner as to render it impossible for unauthorized personnel to enter the premises without such violence as to make the entry easy to detect. If a portion of the facility is to be used for the storage of non-bonded merchandise, the port director shall designate the means for effective separation of the bonded and non-bonded merchandise, such as a wall, fence, or painted line. All inlets and outlets to bonded tanks shall be secured with locks and/or in-bond seals.
(7)
Storage conditions.
Merchandise in the bonded area shall be stored in a safe and sanitary manner to minimize damage to the merchandise, avoid hazards to persons, and meet local, state, and Federal requirements applicable to specific kinds of goods. Doors and entrances shall be left unblocked for access by Customs officers and warehouse proprietor personnel.
(8)
Manner of storage.
Packages shall be received in the warehouse and recorded in the proprietor's inventory and accounting records according to their marks and numbers. Packages containing weighable or gaugeable merchandise not bearing shipping marks and numbers shall be received under the weigher's or gauger's numbers. Packages with exceptions due to damage or loss of contents, or not identical as to quantity or quality of contents shall be stored separately until the discrepancy is resolved with Customs. Merchandise received in the warehouse shall be stored in a manner directly identifying the merchandise with the entry, general order, or seizure number; using a unique identifier for inventory categories composed of fungible merchandise accounted for on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis; or using a unique identifier for inventory categories composed of fungible merchandise accounted for using another approved alternative inventory method.
(i)
Direct identification.
The warehouse proprietor shall mark all shipments for identification, showing the general order or warehouse entry number or seizure number and the date of the general order, entry, or delivery ticket in the case of seizures. Containers covered by a given warehouse entry, general order or seizure shall not be mixed with goods covered by any other entry, general order or seizure. Merchandise covered by a given warehouse entry, general order or seizure may be stored in multiple locations within the warehouse if the proprietor's inventory control system specifically identifies all locations where merchandise for each entry, general order or seizure is stored and the quantity in each location. The proprietor must provide, upon request by a Customs officer, a record balance of goods, specifying the quantity in each storage location, covered by any warehouse entry, general order, or seizure so a physical count can be made to verify the accuracy of the record balance.
(ii)
FIFO.
A proprietor may account for fungible merchandise on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis instead of specific identification by warehouse entry number, provided the merchandise meets the criteria for fungibility and the recordkeeping requirements contained in § 19.12 of this part are met. As of the beginning date of FIFO procedures, each kind of fungible merchandise in the warehouse under FIFO shall constitute a separate inventory category. Each inventory category shall be assigned a unique number or other identifier by the proprietor to distinguish it from all other inventory categories under FIFO. All of the merchandise in a given inventory category shall be physically placed so as to be segregated from merchandise under other inventory categories or merchandise accounted for under other inventory methods. The unique identifier shall be marked on the merchandise, its container, or the location where it is stored so as to clearly show the inventory category of each article under FIFO procedures. Merchandise covered by a given unique identifier may be stored in multiple locations within the warehouse if the proprietor's inventory control system specifically identifies all locations where merchandise for a specific unique identifier is stored and the quantity in each location. The proprietor must provide, upon request by a Customs officer, a record balance of goods, specifying the quantity in each storage location, covered by any warehouse entry, general order, seizure, or unique identifier so a physical count
can be made to verify the accuracy of the record balance.
(iii)
Other alternative inventory methods.
Other alternative inventory systems may be used, if CBP approval is obtained. Importers or proprietors who wish to use an alternative inventory method other than FIFO must apply to CBP Headquarters, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, for approval.
(9)
Miscellaneous responsibilities.
The proprietor is responsible for complying with requirements for transport to his warehouse, deposit, manipulation, manufacture, destruction, shortage or overage, inventory control and recordkeeping systems, and other requirements as specified in this part.
[T.D. 97-19, 62 FR 15834, Apr. 3, 1997, as amended by T.D. 98-22, 63 FR 11825, Mar. 11, 1998; T.D. 98-56, 63 FR 32944, June 16, 1998]
§ 19.5
[Reserved]
§ 19.6
Deposits, withdrawals, blanket permits to withdraw and sealing requirements.
(a)(1)
Deposit in warehouse.
The port director may authorize the deposit of merchandise in designated bonded warehouses, without physical supervision by a CBP officer. Goods for which a warehouse or rewarehouse entry has been accepted, according to the procedures in part 144, subpart B, of this chapter, will be examined or inspected at the place of unlading, bonded warehouse, or other location as ordered by the port director. When merchandise is deposited in a proprietor's warehouse or is accepted and receipted for by a proprietor or his agent for transport to the proprietor's warehouse, the proprietor will be responsible for the quantity and condition of merchandise reflected on entry documentation adjusted by (i) any allowance made under part 158, subparts A and B, of this chapter by the port director, and (ii) any discrepancy report made jointly on the appropriate cartage documents as set forth in § 125.31 of this chapter by the warehouse proprietor and the bonded carrier or licensed cartman or lighterman delivering the goods to the warehouse, or an independent weigher, gauger, measurer, and signed by an authorized representative of the above within 15 calendar days after deposit. A copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be made within five business days of agreement and provided to the port director on the appropriate cartage documents as set forth in § 125.31 of this chapter. If the proprietor of the bonded warehouse transports the goods to the warehouse, no discrepancy report will be necessary.
(2)
Allowance after deposit.
After merchandise has been deposited in the warehouse the proprietor's liability may be further modified by any adjustment for duties allowed by the port director for concealed shortages (i.e., § 158.5(a)), casualty loss (i.e., part 158, subpart C), destruction (i.e., § 158.43), or manipulation (i.e, § 19.11, 19 U.S.C. 1562).
(b)(1)
Withdrawal and removal from warehouse.
The port director may authorize the withdrawal and removal of merchandise, without physical supervision or examination by a CBP officer under permit issued under the procedure set forth in § 144.39 of this chapter. When a withdrawal or removal is not physically supervised by a CBP officer, the warehouse proprietor will be relieved of responsibility only for the merchandise in its warehouse in the condition and quantity as shown on the application for withdrawal or removal. In the case of merchandise to be carted or transported in bond from the warehouse, the proprietor will be relieved of responsibility only if it receives the signed receipt on the withdrawal or removal document of the carrier named in the document. The proprietor's responsibility may be adjusted by any discrepancy report made jointly by the warehouse proprietor, and the licensed cartman or lighterman, bonded carrier, weigher, gauger, or measurer and signed by the authorized representative of the above within 15 calendar days after removal from the warehouse. The adjustments must be noted on the permit copy of the withdrawal or removal document. A copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be promptly provided to the port director.
(2)
Retention in warehouse after withdrawal.
Merchandise for which a permit
for withdrawal has been issued, whether duty-paid or not, need not be physically removed from the warehouse. However, such merchandise must be segregated or physically marked to maintain its identity as merchandise for which a withdrawal permit has been issued. Duty-paid or unconditionally duty-free merchandise which has been withdrawn, but not removed, from a warehouse is no longer deemed to be in CBP custody. All other goods which have been withdrawn, but not removed, remain in CBP custody until the end of the warehouse entry bond period (see § 144.5 of this chapter).
(c)
CBP determination of liability.
When a CBP officer physically supervises the deposit or removal of merchandise under paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, the CBP officer's report of merchandise received or removed will be determinative of the quantity and condition of merchandise received or removed from the warehouse for CBP purposes.
(d)
Blanket permits to withdraw
—(1)
General.
(i) Blanket permits may be used to withdraw merchandise from bonded warehouses for:
(A) Delivery to individuals departing directly from the customs territory for exportation under the sales ticket procedure of § 144.37(h) of this chapter (Class 9 warehouses only);
(B) Aircraft or vessel supplies under § 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317); or
(C) The personal or official use of personnel of foreign governments and international organizations set forth in subpart I, part 148 of this chapter; or
(D) A combination of the foregoing.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, blanket permits to withdraw may be used only for delivery at the port where withdrawn and not for transportation in bond to another port. Blanket permits to withdraw may not be used for delivery to a location for retention or splitting of shipments under the provisions of § 18.24 of this chapter. A withdrawer who desires a blanket permit must state on the warehouse entry, or on the warehouse entry/entry summary when used as an entry, that “Some or all of the merchandise will be withdrawn under blanket permit per § 19.6(d), CBP Regulations.” CBP's acceptance of the entry will constitute approval of the blanket permit. A copy of the entry will be delivered to the proprietor, whereupon merchandise may be withdrawn under the terms of the blanket permit. The permit may be revoked by the port director in favor of individual applications and permits if the permit is found to be used for other purposes, or if necessary to protect the revenue or properly enforce any law or regulation CBP is charged with administering. Merchandise covered by an entry for which a blanket permit was issued may be withdrawn for purposes other than those specified in this paragraph if a withdrawal is properly filed as required in subpart D, part 144, of this chapter.
(iii) Blanket permits to withdraw may be used for a withdrawal for transportation to another port by a duty-free sales enterprise which meets the requirements for exemption as stated in § 144.34(c) of this chapter. In addition, blanket permits to withdraw may be used for a withdrawal from a Class 9 warehouse for transportation in bond to another port of duty-free merchandise intended for passengers' on-board purchases when expressly authorized in writing by the appropriate Director, Field Operations, provided that both the Class 9 warehouse and port of destination are under that Director's authority and the vessel is destined for a foreign destination.
(2)
Withdrawals under blanket permit.
Withdrawals may be made under blanket permit without any further CBP approval, and must be documented by placing a copy of the withdrawal document in the proprietor's permit file folder. Each withdrawal must be filed on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and must be consecutively numbered, prefixed with the letter“B”. The withdrawal must specify the quantity and value of each type of merchandise to be withdrawn. Each copy must bear the summary statement described in § 144.32(a) of this chapter, reflecting the balance of merchandise covered by the warehouse entry. Any joint discrepancy report of the proprietor and the bonded carrier, licensed cartman or lighterman, or weigher, gauger, or
measurer for a supplementary withdrawal must be made on the copy and reported to the port director as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A copy of the withdrawal must be retained in the records of the proprietor as provided in § 19.12(d)(4) of this part. Merchandise must not be removed from the warehouse prior to the preparation of the supplementary withdrawal. If merchandise is so removed, the proprietor will be subject to liquidated damages as if it were removed without a CBP permit.
(3)
Withdrawals under blanket permit from duty-free stores.
Withdrawals under blanket permit from duty-free stores must be made on the sales ticket described in § 144.37(h) of this chapter. The sales ticket need not contain the summary statement described in § 144.32(a) of this chapter, since the information required is included in the sales ticket register. The sales ticket must be serially numbered as provided in § 144.37(h)(2) of this chapter.
(4)
Withdrawals under blanket permit for aircraft or vessel supplies.
Multiple withdrawals under a blanket permit for aircraft or vessel supplies, if consigned to the same daily aircraft flight number or vessel sailing, may be filed on one CBP Form 7512; however, an attachment form, developed by the warehouse proprietor and approved by the port director may be used for all withdrawals. This attachment form must provide a sufficient summary of the goods being withdrawn, and must include the warehouse entry number, the quantity and weight being withdrawn, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States number(s), the value of the goods, import and export lading information, the duty rate and amount, and any applicable Internal Revenue tax calculation, for each warehouse entry being withdrawn. A copy of CBP Form 7512 and the summary attachment must be attached to each permit file folder unless the warehouse proprietor qualifies for the permit file folder exemption under § 19.12(d)(4)(iii) of this part.
(5)
Blanket permit summary.
When all of the merchandise covered by an entry on which a blanket permit to withdraw was issued has been withdrawn, including withdrawals made for purposes other than duty-free store delivery, vessel or aircraft supply, or diplomatic use, the proprietor must prepare a report on a copy of CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or a form on the letterhead of the proprietor, which provides an account of the disposition of the merchandise covered by the blanket permit. The form must bear the words “BLANKET PERMIT SUMMARY” in capital letters conspicuously printed or stamped in the top margin. On the form, the proprietor must certify that the merchandise listed thereunder was withdrawn in compliance with § 19.6(d), and must account for all of the merchandise withdrawn under blanket permit by HTSUS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) number, HTSUS quantity (where applicable) and value. If applicable, the account must separately list and identify merchandise withdrawn for
(i) Duty-free store exportation,
(ii) Vessel or aircraft supply use, and
(iii) Personal or official use of persons and organizations set forth in subpart I, part 148, of this chapter. If all of the merchandise was withdrawn under the sales ticket procedure of § 144.37(h) of this chapter, the sales ticket register may be substituted for the blanket permit summary. The form will be placed in the permit file folder and treated as provided in § 19.12(a) of this part.
(e)
Affixing or breaking of seals.
The port director may authorize a warehouse proprietor to: (1) Break CBP in bond seals affixed under § 18.4 of this chapter, or under any CBP order or directive, on any vehicle or container of goods entered for warehouse upon arrival of the vehicle or container at the warehouse: or (2) affix CBP in bond seals to any vehicle or container of goods for which a withdrawal document has been approved for movement in bond. The affixing or breaking of seals so authorized, will be deemed to have been done under CBP supervision. The proprietor must report to the port director any seal found, upon arrival of the vehicle or container at the warehouse, to be broken, missing, or improperly affixed, and hold the vehicle or container and its contents intact
pending instructions from the port director.

§ 19.9
General order, abandoned, and seized merchandise.
(a)
Acceptance of merchandise.
The arriving carrier (or other party to whom custody of the merchandise was transferred by the carrier under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry) is responsible for preparing a Customs Form (CF) 6043 (Delivery Ticket), or other similar Customs document as designated by the port director or an electronic equivalent as authorized by Customs, to cover the proprietor's receipt of the merchandise and its transport to the warehouse from the custody of the arriving carrier (or other party to whom custody of the merchandise was transferred by the carrier under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry). A joint determination will be made by the warehouse proprietor and the bonded carrier of the quantity and condition of the goods or articles so delivered to the warehouse.

# Manipulation in Bonded Warehouses and Elsewhere
§ 19.11
Manipulation in bonded warehouses and elsewhere.
(a) So far as applicable, the general provisions of the regulations governing warehouses bonded for the storage of imported merchandise shall apply to bonded manipulation warehouses and to other designated places of manipulation.
(b) Merchandise to be manipulated under section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, may be entered on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and sent directly to a storage-manipulation warehouse.
(c) Warehouse proprietors shall not allow manipulation of any merchandise without a prior permit issued by the port director, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Merchandise entered for warehouse may be transferred to a storage-manipulation warehouse; or merchandise entered for storage-manipulation warehouse may be transferred after manipulation to the storage portion of the same warehouse, to another storage warehouse, or to a manufacturing warehouse of class 6.
(d) The application to manipulate, which shall be filed on Customs Form 3499 with the port director having jurisdiction of the warehouse or other designated place of manipulation, shall describe the contemplated manipulation in sufficient detail to enable the port director to determine whether the imported merchandise is to be cleaned, sorted, repacked, or otherwise changed in condition, but not manufactured, within the meaning of section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. If the port director is satisfied that the merchandise is to be so manipulated, he may issue a permit on Customs Form 3499, making any necessary modification in such form. The port director may approve a blanket application to manipulate on Customs Form 3499, for a period of up to one year, for a continuous or a repetitive manipulation. The warehouse proprietor must maintain a running record of manipulations performed under a blanket application, indicating the quantities before and after each manipulation. The record must show what took place at each manipulation describing marks and numbers of packages, location within the facility, quantities, and description of goods before and after manipulation. The port director is authorized to revoke a blanket approval to manipulate and require the proprietor to file individual applications if necessary to protect the revenue, administer any law or regulation, or both. Manipulation resulting in a change in condition of the merchandise, which will make it subject to a lower rate of duty or free of duty upon withdrawal for consumption, is not precluded by the provisions of such section 562.
(e) No merchandise shall be manipulated elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse unless the merchandise has been regularly entered for consumption or warehouse and is of a class entitled to the warehousing privilege under section 557, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
(f) Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, manipulated merchandise may be further manipulated before withdrawal in cases where the port director is satisfied that this will not endanger the revenue or interfere with the efficient conduct of Customs business. The merchandise remaining in the warehouse shall be properly repacked after each manipulation.
(g) Except as provided in § 144.38 of this chapter, manipulated merchandise may be withdrawn under any form of withdrawal, but no withdrawal shall be accepted for less than an entire repacked package. Each type of withdrawal filed shall contain a summary statement indicating the quantity in the warehouse account after manipulation and immediately before the withdrawal, the quantity withdrawn on the particular withdrawal, and the quantity remaining in the warehouse after the withdrawal. When merchandise covered by a consumption entry is manipulated elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse and thereafter withdrawn for consumption, the withdrawal shall be on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and shall be liquidated in accordance with § 159.9 of this chapter.
(h) Merchandise which has been entered for warehouse and placed in a Class 9 warehouse (duty-free store) may be unpacked into its smallest irreducible unit for sale without a prior permit issued by the port director. The port director may issue a blanket permit to a duty-free store for up to one year permitting the destruction of merchandise covered by any entry and found to be nonsaleable, if the merchandise to be destroyed is valued at less than 5 percent of the value of the merchandise at time of entry or $1,250, whichever is less, in its undamaged condition. Such permit may be revoked in favor of a permit for each entry and/or destruction whenever necessary to assure proper destruction and protection of the revenue. The proprietor shall maintain a record of unpacking merchandise into saleable units and destruction of nonsaleable merchandise in its inventory and accounting records.

# Accounts
§ 19.12
Inventory control and recordkeeping system.
(a)
Systems capability.
The proprietor of a class 11 general order warehouse as described in § 19.1 must have an automated inventory control and recordkeeping system. Proprietors of existing class 3, 4, or 5 warehouses as described in § 19.1 certified before December 9, 2002, to receive general order merchandise must have automated inventory control and recordkeeping systems in place with respect to general order merchandise after a period of 2 years from December 9, 2002. All other warehouse proprietors have a choice of maintaining manual or automated inventory control and recordkeeping systems or a combination of manual and automated systems. All inventory control and recordkeeping systems must be capable of:
(1) Accounting for all merchandise transported, deposited, stored, manipulated, manufactured, smelted, refined, destroyed in or removed from the bonded warehouse and all merchandise collected by a proprietor or his agent for transport to his warehouse. The records must provide an audit trail from deposit through manipulation, manufacture, destruction, and withdrawal from the bonded warehouse either by specific identification or other CBP authorized inventory method. The records to be maintained are those which a prudent businessman in the same type of business can be expected to maintain. The records are to be kept in sufficient detail to permit effective and efficient determination by CBP of the proprietor's compliance with these regulations and correctness of his annual submission or reconciliation;
(2) Producing accurate and timely reports and documents as required by this part; and
(3) Identifying shortages and overages of merchandise in sufficient detail to determine the quantity, description, tariff classification and value of the missing or excess merchandise so that appropriate reports can be filed with CBP on a timely basis.
(b)
Procedures manual.
(1) The proprietor must have available at the warehouse an English language copy of its written inventory control and recordkeeping systems procedures manual in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(2) The proprietor must keep current its procedures manual and must submit to the port director a new certification at the time any change in the system is implemented.
(c)
Entry of merchandise into a warehouse
—(1)
Identification.
All merchandise collected by a proprietor or his agent for transport to his warehouse shall be receipted. In addition, all merchandise entered in a warehouse will be recorded in a receiving report or document using a customs entry number or unique identifier if an alternate inventory control method has been approved. All merchandise will be traceable to a customs entry and supporting documentation.
(2)
Quantity verification.
Quantities received will be reconciled to a receiving report or document such as an invoice with any discrepancy reported to the port director as provided in § 19.6(a).
(3)
Recordation.
Merchandise received will be accurately recorded in the accounting and inventory system records from the receiving report or document using the customs entry number or unique identifier if an alternative inventory control method has been approved.
(d)
Accountability for merchandise in a warehouse
—(1)
Identification of merchandise.
The customs entry number or unique identifier, as applicable under § 19.4(b)(8), will be used to identify and trace merchandise.
(2)
Inventory records.
The inventory records will specify by customs entry number or unique identifier if an alternative inventory control method is approved:
(i) The location of the merchandise within the warehouse;
(ii) Except for merchandise in general order, the cost or value of the merchandise, unless the proprietor's financial records maintain cost or value and the records are made available for CBP review; and
(iii) The beginning balance, cumulative receipts and withdrawals, adjustments, destructions, and current balance on hand by date and quantity.
(3)
Theft, shortage, overage or damage
—(i)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, any theft or suspected theft or overage or any extraordinary shortage or damage (equal to one percent or more of the value of the merchandise in an entry or covered by a unique identifier; or if the missing merchandise is subject to duties and taxes in excess of $100) must be immediately brought to the attention of the port director, and confirmed in writing within five business days after the shortage, overage, or damage has been brought to the attention of the port director. An entry for warehouse must be filed for all overages by the person with the right to make entry within five business days of the date of discovery. The responsible party must pay the applicable duties, taxes and interest on thefts and shortages reported to CBP within 20 calendar days following the end of the calendar month in which the shortage is discovered. The port director may allow the consolidation of duties and taxes applicable to multiple shortages into one payment; however, the amount applicable to each warehouse entry is to be listed on the submission and must specify the applicable duty, tax and interest. These same requirements apply when cumulative thefts, shortages or overages under a specific entry or unique identifier total one percent or more of the value of the merchandise or if the duties and taxes owed exceed $100. Upon identification, the proprietor must record all shortages and overages in its inventory control and recordkeeping system, whether or not they are required to be reported to the port director at the time. The proprietor must also record all
shortages and overages as required in the CBP Form 300 or annual reconciliation report under paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section, as appropriate. Duties and taxes applicable to any non-extraordinary shortage or damage and not required to be paid earlier must be reported and submitted to the port director no later than the date the certification of preparation of CBP Form 300 is due or at the time the certification of preparation of the annual reconciliation report is due, as prescribed in paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section.
(ii)
Class 9 warehouses.
With respect to Class 9 warehouses, any theft or suspected theft or overage or any extraordinary shortage or damage (equal to one percent or more of the merchandise in an entry or covered by a unique identifier; or if the missing merchandise is subject to duties and taxes in excess of $100) must be immediately brought to the attention of the port director, and confirmed in writing within 20 calendar days after the shortage, overage, or damage has been brought to the attention of the port director. An entry for warehouse must be filed for all overages by the person with the right to make entry within 20 calendar days of the date of discovery. The responsible party must pay the applicable duties, taxes and interest on thefts and shortages reported to CBP within 20 calendar days following the end of the calendar month in which the shortage is discovered. The port director may allow the consolidation of duties and taxes applicable to multiple shortages into one payment; however, the amount applicable to each warehouse entry is to be listed on the submission and must specify the applicable duty, tax and interest. These same requirements apply when cumulative thefts, shortages or overages under a specific entry or unique identifier total one percent or more of the value of the merchandise or if the duties and taxes owed exceed $100. Upon identification, the proprietor must record all shortages and overages in its inventory control and recordkeeping system, whether or not they are required to be reported to the port director at the time. The proprietor must also record all shortages and overages as required in the CBP Form 300 or annual reconciliation report under paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section, as appropriate. Duties and taxes applicable to any non-extraordinary shortage or damage and not required to be paid earlier must be reported and submitted to the port director no later than the date the certification of preparation of CBP Form 300 is due or at the time the certification of preparation of the annual reconciliation report is due, as prescribed in paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section. Discrepancies found in a Class 9 warehouse with integrated locations as set forth in § 19.35(c) will be the net discrepancies for a unique identifier (see § 19.4(b)(8)(ii) of this part) such that overages within one sales location will be offset against shortages in another location that is within the integrated location. A Class 9 proprietor who transfers merchandise between facilities in different ports without being required to file a rewarehouse entry in accordance with § 144.34 of this chapter may offset overages and shortages within the same unique identifier for merchandise located in stores in different ports (see § 19.4(b)(8)(ii) of this part).
(4)
Permit file folders
—(i)
Maintenance.
Permit file folders must be maintained and kept up to date by filing all receipts, damage or shortage reports, manipulation requests, withdrawals, removals and blanket permit summaries within five business days after the event occurs. The permit file folders must be kept in a secure area and must be made available for inspection by CBP at all reasonable hours.
(ii)
Review.
When the final withdrawal of merchandise relating to a specific warehouse entry, general order or seizure occurs, the warehouse proprietor must: review the permit file folder to ensure that all necessary documentation is in the file folder accounting for the merchandise covered by the entry; notify CBP of any merchandise covered by the warehouse entry, general order or seizure which has not been withdrawn or removed; and file the permit file folder with CBP within 30 calendar days after final withdrawal, except as allowed by paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section. The permit file folder for merchandise not
withdrawn during the general order period must be submitted to the port director upon receipt from CBP of the CBP Form 6043.
(iii)
Exemption to maintenance requirement.
Maintenance of permit file folders will not be required, if the proprietor has an automated system capable of: satisfactorily summarizing all actions by CBP warehouse entry; providing upon demand by CBP an entry activity summary report which lists all individual receipts, withdrawals, destructions, manipulations and adjustments by warehouse entry and is cross-referenced to the source documents for each transaction; and maintaining source documents so that the documents can be readily retrieved upon request. Failure to provide the entry activity summary report or documentation supporting the entry activity summary report upon demand by the port director or the field director of regulatory audit could result in reinstatement by the port director of the requirement to maintain the permit file folder for all warehouse entries. When final withdrawal is made, the proprietor must submit the entry activity summary report to CBP. Prior to submission, the proprietor must ensure the accuracy of the summary report and assure that all supporting documentation is on file and available for review if requested by CBP.
(iv)
Exemption to submission requirement.
At the discretion of the port director, a proprietor may be allowed to furnish formal notification of final withdrawal in lieu of the requirement to submit the permit file folder or entry activity summary within 30 calendar days of each final withdrawal. If approved to use this procedure the proprietor could be required by the port director to submit permit file folders or entry activity summaries on a selective basis. Failure to promptly provide the permit file folder or entry activity summary upon request by the port director or the field director of regulatory audit could result in withdrawal of this privilege.
(5)
Physical inventory.
The proprietor must take at least an annual physical inventory of all merchandise in the warehouse, or periodic cycle counts of selected categories of merchandise such that each category is counted at least once during the year, with prior notification of the date(s) given to CBP so that CBP personnel may observe or participate in the inventory if deemed necessary. If the proprietor of a Class 2 or Class 9 warehouse has merchandise covered by one warehouse entry, but stored in multiple warehouse facilities as provided for under § 144.34 of this chapter, the facility where the original entry was filed must reconcile the on-hand balances at all locations with the record balance for those entries with merchandise in multiple locations. The proprietor must notify the port director of any discrepancies, record appropriate adjustments in the inventory control and recordkeeping system, and make required payments and entries to CBP, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(e)
Withdrawal of merchandise from a warehouse.
All bonded merchandise withdrawn from a warehouse will be accurately recorded within the inventory control and recordkeeping system. The inventory control and recordkeeping system must have the capability to trace all withdrawals back to a customs entry and to ultimate disposition of the merchandise by the proprietor.
(f)
Special provisions for use of FIFO inventory procedures
—(1)
Notification.
A proprietor who wishes to use FIFO procedures for all or part of the merchandise in a bonded warehouse must provide the port director a written certification that: The proprietor has read and understands CBP FIFO procedures set forth in this section; the proprietor's procedures are in accordance with CBP FIFO procedures, and the proprietor agrees to abide by those procedures; and the proprietor of a public warehouse will obtain the written consent of any importer using the warehouse before applying FIFO procedures to their merchandise.
(2)
Qualifying merchandise.
FIFO inventory procedures may be used only for fungible merchandise. For purposes of this section, “fungible merchandise” means merchandise which is identical and interchangeable for all commercial
purposes. While commercial interchangeability is usually decided between buyer and seller or between proprietor and importer, CBP is the final arbiter of fungibility in bonded warehouses. The criteria for determining whether merchandise is fungible include, but are not limited to, Governmental and recognized industrial standards, part numbers, tariff classification, value, brand name, unit of quantity (such as barrels, gallons, pounds, pieces), model number, style and same kind and quality. Fungible textile and textile products which are withdrawn from a Class 9 warehouse may be accounted for using FIFO inventory procedures, inasmuch as such articles would be exempt from textile quotas.
(3)
Merchandise specifically excluded.
FIFO procedures cannot be applied to the following merchandise, as well as any other merchandise which does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section:
(i) Merchandise subject to quota, visa or export restrictions chargeable to different countries of origin;
(ii) Textile and textile products of different quota categories;
(iii) Merchandise with different tariff classifications or rates of duty, except where the difference is within the merchandise itself (such as kits, merchandise in unusual containers) or where the tariff classification or dutiability is determined only by conditions upon withdrawal (for example, withdrawal for vessel supplies, bonded wool transactions);
(iv) Merchandise with different legal requirements for marking, labeling or stamping;
(v) Merchandise with different trademarks;
(vi) Merchandise of different grades or qualities;
(vii) Merchandise with different importers of record;
(viii) Damaged or deteriorated merchandise;
(ix) Restricted merchandise; or
(x) General order, abandoned or seized merchandise.
(4)
Maintenance of FIFO.
FIFO procedures used for merchandise in any inventory category, must be used consistently throughout the warehouse storage and recordkeeping practices and procedures for the merchandise. For example, merchandise may not be added to inventory by FIFO but withdrawn by bypassing certain inventory layers to reach a specific warehouse entry other than the oldest one. However, this does not preclude the use of specific identification for some merchandise in a warehouse entry and FIFO for other merchandise, so long as they are segregated in physical storage and clearly distinguished in the inventory and accounting records.
(5)
FIFO recordkeeping.
In the inventory and accounting records, the proprietor must establish an inventory layer for each warehouse entry represented in each inventory category. The layers must be established in the order of time of acceptance of the entry or by the date of importation of merchandise covered by each applicable warehouse entry. There must be no mixing of layering both by time of acceptance and date of importation in the same warehouse. Records for each layer must, as a minimum, show the warehouse entry number, date of acceptance, date of importation, quantity and unit of quantity. They must also show for each entry the type of warehouse withdrawal number or other specific removal event charged against the entry, by date and quantity. Each addition to or deduction from the inventory category must be posted in the appropriate inventory category within 2 business days after the event occurs. All FIFO records and documentation must consistently use the same unit of quantity within each inventory category.
(6)
Entry requirements.
Warehouse entries covering any merchandise to be accounted for under FIFO must be prominently marked “FIFO” on the face of the entry document. The entry document or an attachment thereto must show the unique identifier of each inventory category to be accounted for under FIFO, the quantity in each inventory category and the unit of quantity.
(7)
Receipts.
Any shortages, overages, or damage found upon receipt must be attributed to the entry under which the merchandise was received. FIFO procedures will not take effect until
the merchandise is physically placed in the storage location for the inventory category represented in the entry.
(8)
Manipulation.
When manipulation results in a product with a different unique identifier, the inventory and accounting records must show the quantities of merchandise in each inventory category appearing in the product covered by the new unique identifier. The withdrawal must show the unique identifiers of both the materials used in the manipulation and the product as manipulated. The quantities of the original unique identifiers will be deducted from their respective warehouse entries on a FIFO basis when the resultant product is withdrawn.
(9)
Discontinuance of FIFO.
A proprietor may voluntarily discontinue the use of FIFO procedures for all or part of the merchandise currently under FIFO by providing written notification to the port director. The notification must clearly describe the merchandise, by commercial names and unique identifiers, to be removed from FIFO. Following notification, the merchandise must be segregated in both the recordkeeping system and the physical location by warehouse entry number and the quantities so removed must be deducted from the appropriate FIFO inventory category balances. Merchandise so removed must be maintained under the specific identification inventory method. FIFO procedures which were voluntarily discontinued may be reinstated, but not for merchandise covered by any warehouse entry for which FIFO was discontinued.
(g)
Warehouse proprietor submission.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) of this section or § 19.19(b) of this part, the warehouse proprietor must prepare a Warehouse Proprietor's Submission on CBP Form 300 within 45 calendar days from the end of the business year and maintain the Submission on file for 5 years from the end of the business year covered by the Submission. The proprietor must submit to the port director, within 10 business days after preparation of the CBP Form 300, a letter signed by the proprietor certifying that the CBP Form 300 has been prepared, is available for CBP review, and is accurate. If the proprietor of a Class 2 or Class 9 warehouse has merchandise covered by one warehouse entry, but stored in multiple warehouse facilities as provided for under § 144.34 of this chapter, the CBP Form 300 must cover all locations and warehouses of the proprietor. An alternative format may be used for providing the information required on the CBP Form 300.

# Smelting and Refining Warehouses
§ 19.17
Application to establish warehouse; bond.
(a)
Application.
Application for the bonding of a plant of a manufacturer engaged in the smelting or refining, or both, of metal-bearing materials as provided for in section 312, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to reduce the metal content thereof to an unwrought metal, or metal in the form of oxides or other compounds which are obtained directly from the treatment of the dutiable materials provided for in chapters 26 and 71 through 83, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), shall be made by the manufacturer, to the director of the port nearest in which such plant is situated, giving the location of the premises and setting forth the work proposed to be carried on therein.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Discontinuance.
At the request of the proprietor the bonded status of the warehouse may be discontinued at any time provided the port director approves such discontinuance and the proprietor complies with directions of the port director with respect to the disposition of merchandise which may remain in the warehouse. The number of warehouses covered by a blanket smelting and refining bond may be reduced by discontinuance without necessitating a new bond unless the proprietor so desires.
(d) Upon the importation at any seaboard or frontier port of the United States of metal-bearing materials in any form intended for a bonded smelting or refining warehouse situated at some other port of entry, they may be forwarded under an immediate transportation without appraisement entry.
(e)
Bond.
Upon the arrival of imported metal-bearing material in any form for the purpose of being smelted or refined, or both, in bond at a port where a bonded smelting or refining warehouse is established, it shall be entered for warehouse. A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter shall be on file. The port director shall thereupon issue a permit to the inspector to send such metal bearing materials from the importing vessel or vehicle by designated bonded vessels or vehicles to the smelting and refining warehouse named in the entry.
(f) Bonded metal-bearing materials shall be kept separate and distinct from nonbonded material until they have been sampled and weighed. The proprietor shall maintain a report of sampling, weighing, and assay of each shipment of bonded materials received into the warehouse for 5 years after liquidation of the warehouse entry for shipment.
(g)
Statement of inventory and bond charges.
Where two or more smelting or refining warehouses are included under one blanket smelting and refining bond, an overall statement must be prepared and maintained by the principal named in the bond by the 28th of each month, showing the inventory as of the close of the preceding month, of all metals on hand at each plant covered by the blanket bond and the total of bonded charges for all plants. If the warehouses covered by an overall statement are located in more than one port, each port director may choose to verify the accuracy of the inventory report only with respect to that portion of the report that relates to amounts held at a plant that is located within that port director's jurisdiction. All discrepancies which cannot be reconciled by the port director shall be reported to Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service. If Headquarters finds that the aggregate quantity of dutiable metal at the several plants does not equal the quantity charged against the blanket
bond, duties shall be collected for the quantity determined to be deficient.

§ 19.18
Smelting and refining; allowance for wastage; withdrawal for consumption.
(a) Except where absolute deductions have been allowed in the liquidation of the entry for losses on copper, lead, and zinc content of metal-bearing materials, pursuant to Chapter 26, Additional U.S. Note 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see § 151.55 of this chapter), the actual percentage of losses by weight shall be allowed if more than 90 percent by weight of:
(1) The zinc content initially treated at any lead plant, (2) the copper content of the imported materials treated at any zinc plant, or (3) the copper, lead, or zinc content of the imported material initially treated at any plant other than a copper, lead, or zinc plant is lost in processing such materials. Such actual percentage of losses by weight of the metal content shall be that shown by the manufacturer's annual statement. Such losses shall be applied in the liquidation of the entry to materials entered for consumption or for warehouse, during a 12-month period beginning on the first day of the month nearest to 90 days after the close of the manufacturer's fiscal year immediately preceding such 90-day period, provided the importer makes claim therefor in writing at the time the merchandise is entered. No further wastage shall be allowed. The full dutiable contents of such metal-bearing materials, as ascertained by commercial assay made by the Government chemists, less the wastage allowance (including dutiable metals entirely lost in smelting or refining, or both), shall constitute the quantity of dutiable metal which must be either exported, duty-paid, or transferred to another bonded warehouse in order to secure the cancellation of the charge made against the proprietor's bond as shown by the warehouse or rewarehouse entry account.
(b) Upon the withdrawal for consumption of metal so smelted or refined, or both, duty shall be collected thereon without the allowance for wastage, except where the metal was transferred to a bonded Customs warehouse other than a smelting warehouse and withdrawn therefrom for consumption. However, duty-paid warehouse withdrawals for consumption may be filed with regard to metal which will be physically withdrawn in the form of smelted or refined products whether at the time of the filing of the withdrawal papers the dutiable metal covered by the bond charge being cancelled by the withdrawal is in the form of ores, concentrates, crude metals, or intermediate products. If the warehouse withdrawal for consumption covers a product which does not sustain the full wastage allowable (see § 19.22) prior to being physically released from Customs custody, a proportionate part only of such wastage may be allowed. The warehouse withdrawal and delivery permit shall state the estimated amount of the dutiable metal contained in the products, and the warehouse withdrawal shall specify the applicable wastage. A quantity of dutiable metal equivalent to the smelted or refined products covered by each withdrawal for consumption must be actually on hand at the plant or plants covered by the bond at the time of filing the withdrawals; but neither the actual ability to withdraw smelted or refined products from the warehouse nor the actual physical condition described in the withdrawal will be required at the time of filing the withdrawal.

§ 19.19
Manufacturers' records; annual statement.
(a) Every manufacturer engaged in smelting or refining, or both, shall immediately notify the director of the port nearest which the plant is located of any material change in the character of the metal-bearing materials smelted or refined and of any change in the methods of smelting or refining.
Each plant for which any of the deductions provided for in Chapter 26, Additional U.S. Note 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, is to be claimed shall maintain complete smelting and refining records showing the receipts and disposition of each shipment of materials received in the plant. If losses are to be claimed under paragraph (c) of said headnote, a record shall be kept which will become a part of the annual statement described in paragraph (b) of this section. These records shall be retained for a period of not less than 5 years. In the case of records forming the basis of such an annual statement, the period for retention shall run from the date of the related annual statement. All such records shall be made available to the port director for such inspection and verification as he may deem advisable.
(b) Every manufacturer engaged in smelting or refining, or both, must prepare and submit to the port director at the port nearest which the plant is located an annual statement for the fiscal year for the plant involved not later than 60 days after the termination of that fiscal year. The annual statement for the smelting or refining warehouse or both, shall be in lieu of the warehouse proprietors submission required by § 19.12. No specific form is prescribed in which such statement shall be prepared. As basic information, the statement shall show the quantities of metal-bearing materials on hand at the beginning of the period and the dutiable contents thereof; the quantities of metal-bearing materials received during the period and the dutiable contents thereof; the total metal-bearing materials to be accounted for and the dutiable contents thereof; the quantities of metal-bearing materials on hand at the end of the period and the dutiable contents thereof; and the quantities of metal-bearing materials worked during the period and the dutiable contents thereof. The statement of the quantity of metal-bearing materials worked during the period shall show the quantity of foreign material and the quantity of domestic material put in process during the smelting operations. The statement shall contain such further information concerning the quantities and kinds of metals and intermediary products produced at the plant as will show the wastage sustained in the smelting and refining operation.

§ 19.22
Withdrawal of metal refined in part from imported crude metal and in part from crude metal produced from imported materials.
Upon withdrawal for exportation of metal from a bonded warehouse engaged in refining, or smelting and refining, part of which metal was obtained from imported crude metal and part from crude metal produced by smelting imported materials, the warehouse account shall be credited with the quantity of metal so withdrawn, plus (a) the refining wastage allowance prescribed for that establishment, and (b) the smelting wastage allowance prescribed for the establishment in which the imported materials were smelted, and (c) any dutiable metals shown on the warehouse entry or the rewarehouse entry filed at the first-mentioned warehouse which have been lost and are attributable to the exported product. However, upon withdrawal of such refined metal for consumption, no allowance shall be made for wastage except where the withdrawal is made from a bonded Customs warehouse other than a bonded smelting and refining warehouse.
§ 19.23
Withdrawal for exportation from one port to be credited on warehouse entry account at another port.
On exportation of metal pursuant to the provisions of section 312(b)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the general procedure covering warehouse withdrawals for exportation shall be followed. The proprietor of the plant from which the withdrawal is made shall prepare a sufficient number of copies of withdrawals on Customs Form 7512, in addition to any other copies required by the regulations, to enable the director of the port of withdrawal to forward a copy to the director of each other port where credit is to be applied. Such withdrawals shall designate the plant or plants which are to receive the credit, shall specify the warehouse entry number or numbers to which the credit is to be applied, and shall state the quantity of dutiable metal which is to be applied to each warehouse entry specified, and when any of the credits specified represent the last withdrawal against a particular warehouse entry, the words “final withdrawal” shall be shown on the withdrawal. When two or more plants nearest a given port are designated to receive credit, sufficient copies of the withdrawals shall be prepared to cover each such plant and entry. If at the time of withdrawal the warehouse proprietor does not know the plants or warehouse entry numbers
which are to be credited with the withdrawal, or the metallic content of the dutiable metal being exported, the preparation of the before-mentioned copies of Customs Form 7512 may be postponed for a period of not longer than 30 days from the date of the movement of the dutiable metal from the plant. In such cases, a so-called memorandum withdrawal, in the number of copies provided for in § 144.37 of this chapter, may be used in the first instance for the purpose of obtaining the required Customs record of the exportation of the dutiable metal under Customs supervision. All memorandum withdrawals shall be conspicuously endorsed “Memorandum Withdrawal.”

§ 19.24
Theoretical transfer without physical shipment of dutiable metal.
(a) Transfer may be made from one port of entry to another by a withdrawal for transportation and rewarehouse executed in regular form without physical shipment of the metal, provided enough like metal in any form is on hand at the establishment to which the theoretical transfer is made to satisfy the new bond obligations.
(b) The wastage allowance established for the plant from which the original withdrawal for transportation was made shall be shown on the transfer withdrawal and set up as a part of the charge against the bond at the plant to which the metal was theoretically transferred. Such wastage shall govern and be the basis for allowance when metal is withdrawn from the plant where the theoretical rewarehousing was affected.
§ 19.25
Credit to be applied under various forms of withdrawals.
(a) The warehouse entry account of the plant designated in the withdrawal to receive credit for the exportation shall be credited with the following:
(1) The quantity of dutiable metal exported.
(2) The wastage in effect on the date of entry at the plant of initial treatment of such materials.
(3) The proportion of any other dutiable metals in the importation being credited which were lost at the said plant in the production of a quantity of dutiable metal equal to that exported.
(b) If credit is being applied to a charge set up by a theoretical transfer under § 19.24 at the plant designated in the withdrawal to receive the credit, the wastages to be applied shall be those set up at such plant in connection with the theoretical transfer, irrespective of the date of the withdrawal.
(c) On the transfer of dutiable metal to a bonded storage warehouse, credit shall be applied at the plant designated in the withdrawal to receive the credit in the manner provided for in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to withdrawals for exportation. The charge so credited at the plant shall be set up on the warehouse entry account of the storage warehouse to which the dutiable metal has been transferred. In the case of the withdrawal of dutiable metal for transfer to a bonded manufacturing warehouse, credit shall be applied in the same manner at the plant designated in the withdrawal to receive the credit, but the charge set upon the warehouse entry account of the bonded manufacturing warehouse shall be limited to the quantity of dutiable metal transferred to such warehouse.

# Duty-Free Stores

# Source:
Sections 19.35 through 19.39 issued by T.D. 92-81, 57 FR 37698, Aug. 20, 1992, unless otherwise noted.
§ 19.35
Establishment of duty-free stores (Class 9 warehouses).
(a)
General.
A class 9 warehouse (duty-free store) may be established for exportation of conditionally duty-free merchandise by individuals departing the Customs territory, inclusive of foreign trade zones, by aircraft, vessel, or departing directly by vehicle or on foot to a contiguous country. Such articles must accompany the individual on his person or in the same aircraft, vessel, or vehicle in which the individual departs. “Conditionally duty-free merchandise” means merchandise sold by a duty-free store on which duties and/or internal revenue taxes (where applicable) have not been paid. Except insofar as the provisions of this section and §§ 19.36-19.39 are more specific, the procedures for bonded warehouses apply to duty-free stores (Class 9 warehouses).
(b)
Location.
A duty-free store (class 9 warehouse) may be established or located only:
(1) Within the same port of entry from which a purchaser of duty-free store merchandise departs the Customs territory;
(2) Within 25 statute miles from the exit point through which a purchaser of duty-free store merchandise departs the Customs territory; or
(3) In the case of an airport store, within any staffed port of entry, or within 25 statute miles from any staffed port of entry.
(c)
Integrated locations.
A Class 9 warehouse with multiple noncontiguous sales and crib locations (see § 19.37(a) of this part) containing conditionally duty-free merchandise and requested by the proprietor may be treated by Customs as one location if:
(1) The proprietor can provide Customs upon demand with the proper on-hand balance of each inventory item in each storage location, sales room, crib, mobile crib, delivery cart, or other conveyance or noncontiguous location; and
(2) The recordkeeping system is centralized up to the point where a sale is made so as to automatically reduce the sale quantity by location from centralized inventory or inventory records must be updated no less frequently than at the end of each business day to reflect that day's activity.
(d)
Exit point.
The exit point referred to in paragraph (b) of this section means an area in close proximity to an actual exit for departing from the Customs territory, including the gate holding area in the case of an airport, but only if there is reasonable assurance that conditionally duty-free merchandise delivered in the gate holding area will be exported from the Customs territory. The exit point in the case of a land border or seaport duty-free store is the point at which a departing individual has no practical alternative to continuing on to a foreign country or to returning to Customs territory by passing through a U.S. Customs inspection facility. The port director's decision as to what constitutes the exit point or reasonable assurance of exportation in a given situation is final.
(e)
Notice to customers.
Class 9 warehouse proprietors shall display in prominent places where they will be noticed and read by customers signs which state clearly that any conditionally duty-free merchandise purchased from the store:
(1) Has not been subjected to any U.S. Federal duty or tax;
(2) If brought back to the United States must be declared and is subject to U.S. Federal duty and tax with personal exemption; and,
(3) Is subject to the customs laws and regulations, including possible duties and taxes, of any foreign country to which it is taken.
(f)
Security of sales rooms and cribs.
The physical and procedural security requirements of § 19.4(b)(6) of this part shall be applied to the security of the sales rooms and cribs by the port director. The proprietor shall establish procedures to safeguard the merchandise so as to accommodate the movement of purchasers and prospective purchasers of conditionally duty-free merchandise contained in duty-free sales rooms and cribs.
(g)
Approval of governmental authority.
If a state or local or other governmental authority, incident to its jurisdiction over any airport, seaport, or other exit point facility, requires that a concession or other form of approval be obtained from that authority with respect to the operation of a duty-free
store under which merchandise is delivered to or through such facility for exportation, merchandise incident to such operation may not be withdrawn for exportation and transferred to or through such facility unless the operator of the duty-free store demonstrates to the port director that the concession or approval required for the enterprise has been obtained.
[T.D. 92-81, 57 FR 37698, Aug. 20, 1992, as amended by T.D. 97-19, 62 FR 15839, Apr. 3, 1997; T.D. 00-33, 65 FR 31261, May 17, 2000]
§ 19.36
Requirements for duty-free store operations.
(a)
Withdrawals.
Merchandise withdrawn under the sales ticket procedure in § 144.37(h) of this chapter may be delivered only to individuals departing from the customs territory for exportation or to persons and organizations for use as specified in subpart I, part 148, of this chapter. Withdrawals of other kinds may be made from Class 9 warehouses, but only through separate withdrawals (or withdrawals under blanket permit for vessel or aircraft supplies) under an approved permit of the port director as provided in § 144.39 of this chapter.
(b)
Procedures required.
Each duty-free store must establish, maintain, and follow written procedures to provide reasonable assurance to the port director that conditionally duty-free merchandise purchased therein will be exported from the customs territory. A copy of any change in the procedure will be provided to the port director before it is implemented. However, receipt by CBP of the procedures of any change thereto must not be construed as approval by CBP of the procedures. The port director is responsible for ensuring that each enterprise has established guidelines with CBP and is complying with those guidelines, giving assurance that proper supervision exists when delivery is made to the purchaser at or before the exit point. The port director may at any time require any change in the procedures deemed necessary for assurance of exportation.
(c)
Personal-use restrictions.
Any duty-free store which delivers conditionally duty-free merchandise to purchasers at an airport exit point must establish, maintain, and enforce written restrictions on the sale of conditionally duty-free merchandise to any one individual to personal-use quantities. Personal-use quantities means quantities that are only suitable for uses other than resale, and includes reasonable quantities for household or family consumption as well as for gifts to others. Proprietors will not knowingly sell or deliver conditionally duty-free merchandise in any quantity to any individual for the purpose of resale. A copy of the restrictions and of any change thereto must be provided to the port director prior to implementation. However, receipt of the written restrictions by CBP will not be construed as approval by CBP of the restrictions. The port director may require any change in the restrictions deemed necessary to conform to the personal-use quantity restriction of this section.
(d)
Reimported merchandise.
Merchandise purchased in a duty-free store is not eligible for exemption from duty, or tax where applicable, under chapter 98, subchapter IV, Harmonized Tariff Schedule, if it is brought back to the United States after exportation. To enforce this restriction, the port director may require the proprietor to mark or otherwise place a distinguishing identifier on individual items of merchandise to indicate the items were sold in a U.S. duty-free store, if a pattern is disclosed in which such items are being brought back to the United States without declaration. A pattern of undeclared reimportations means a number of instances over a period of time and not isolated instances of unrelated violations. Any such marking required by the port director will be inconspicuous to the purchaser and will not detract from the value of the merchandise. The marking requirement will be limited to the items or types of merchandise noted in the pattern, and will not be extended to all merchandise of the responsible store proprietor unless all or most items are part of the pattern.
(e)
Merchandise eligible for warehousing in duty-free stores (Class 9 Warehouses)

(2)
Marking exception to physical segregation.
Merchandise may be identified or marked “DUTY-PAID” or “U.S.-ORIGIN”, or similar markings, as applicable, to enable CBP officers to easily distinguish conditionally duty-free merchandise from other merchandise in the sales or crib area.
(3)
Electronic inventory exception to physical segregation.
If the proprietor has an electronic inventory system capable of immediately identifying conditionally duty-free merchandise from other merchandise, the proprietor need not physically separate conditionally duty-free merchandise from other merchandise or mark the merchandise.
(f)
Sale of merchandise.
Conditionally duty-free merchandise for exportation at airport or seaport exit points may be sold and delivered only to purchasers who display valid tickets, or in the case of chartered or for-hire flights that have not issued tickets, other proof of impending departure from the customs territory, and to crewmembers who have been engaged for a flight or voyage departing directly from the customs territory with no intermediate stops in the U.S.
(g)
Inventory procedure.
Duty-free store proprietors must maintain, at the duty-free store or at another location approved by the port director, a current inventory separately for each storage area, crib, and sales area containing conditionally duty-free merchandise by warehouse entry, or by unique identifier where permitted by the port director. Proprietors must assure that CBP has ready access to those records, and that the records are stored in such a way as to keep transactions of multiple facilities separated. The inventory must be reconcilable with the accounting and inventory records and the permit file folder requirements of § 19.12 (d), (e) and (f) of this part. Proprietors are subject also to the recordkeeping requirements of other paragraphs of § 19.12, as well as those of §§ 19.6(d), 19.37(d), 19.39(d) of this part, and 144.37(h)(3) of this chapter.

It shall be located beyond the exit point, unless exception has been made under § 19.39 (a) and (b) of this part. The crib may be a permanent location or a mobile facility which is periodically moved to a location beyond the exit point. The quantity of goods in the crib may be an amount requested by the proprietor which is commercially necessary for the delivery operations for a period, if approved by the port director. The port director may increase or decrease the quantity as deemed necessary for the protection of the revenue and proper administration of U.S. laws and regulations, or may order the return to the storage area of goods remaining unsold.

(3) The container station operator or an officer of a corporation which has been granted the privilege of operating a container station is convicted of or has committed acts which would constitute a felony, or a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;
(4) The container station operator fails to retain merchandise which has been designated for examination;
(5) The container station operator does not provide secure facilities or properly safeguard merchandise within the container station;
(6) The container station operator fails to furnish a current list of names,

(b)
Notice and appeal.
The port director shall suspend or revoke the privilege of operating a container station by serving notice of the proposed action in writing upon the container station operator. The notice shall be in the form of a statement specifically setting forth the grounds for revocation or suspension of the privilege and shall be final and conclusive upon the container station operator unless he shall file with the port director a written notice of appeal. The container station operator may file a written notice of appeal from the revocation or suspension within 10 days following receipt of the notice of revocation or suspension. The notice of appeal shall be filed in duplicate and shall set forth the response of the container station operator to the statement of the port director. The container station operator, in his notice of appeal, may request a hearing.
(c)
Hearing on appeal.
If a hearing is requested, it shall be held before a hearing officer designated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee within 30 days following application therefor. The container station operator shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing at least 5 days prior thereto. The container station operator may be represented by counsel at the revocation or suspension hearing. All testimony in the proceeding shall be subject to cross-examination. A stenographic record of any such proceeding shall be made and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the container station operator. At the conclusion of such proceeding or review of a written appeal, the hearing officer or the port director, as the case may be, shall forthwith transmit all papers and the stenographic record of any hearing, to the Commissioner of Customs, together with his recommendation for final action. Following a hearing and within 10 calendar days after delivery of a copy of the stenographic record, the container station operator may submit to the Commissioner of Customs, in writing, additional views and arguments on the basis of such record. If neither the container station operator nor his attorney appear for a scheduled hearing, the hearing officer shall conclude the hearing and transmit all papers with his recommendation to the Commissioner of Customs. The Commissioner shall thereafter render his decision, in writing, stating his reasons therefor, with respect to the action proposed by the hearing officer or the port director. Such decision shall be transmitted to the port director and served by him on the container station operator.

§ 24.1
Collection of Customs duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following procedure shall be observed in the collection of Customs duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges (see §§ 111.29(b) and 141.1(b) of this chapter):
(1) Any form of United States currency or coin legally current at time of acceptance shall be accepted.
(2) Any bank draft, cashier's check, or certified check drawn on a national or state bank or trust company of the United States or a bank in Puerto Rico or any possession of the United States if such draft or checks are acceptable for deposit by a Federal Reserve bank, branch Federal Reserve bank, or other designated depositary shall be accepted.
(3)(i) An uncertified check drawn by an interested party on a national or state bank or trust company of the United States or a bank in Puerto Rico or any possession of the United States if such checks are acceptable for deposit by a Federal Reserve bank, branch Federal Reserve bank, or other designated depositary shall be accepted if there is on file with CBP a bond to secure the payment of the duties, taxes, fees, interest, or other charges, or if a bond has not been filed, the organization or individual drawing and tendering the uncertified check has been approved by an authorized CBP official to make payment in such manner. In determining whether an uncertified check shall be accepted in the absence of a bond, an authorized CBP official shall use available credit data obtainable without cost to the Government, such as that furnished by banks, local business firms, better business bureaus, or local credit exchanges, sufficient to satisfy him of the credit standing or reliability of the drawer of the check. For purposes of
this paragraph, a customs broker is an interested party for the purpose of CBP's acceptance of such broker's own check, provided the broker has on file the necessary power of attorney for the performance of ministerial acts. CBP may look to the principal (importer) or to the surety should the check be dishonored.
(ii) If, during the preceding 12-month period, an importer or interested party has paid duties or any other obligation by check and more than one check is returned dishonored by the debtor's financial institution, an authorized CBP official shall require a certified check, money order or cash from the importer or interested party for each subsequent payment until such time that an authorized CBP official is satisfied that the debtor has the ability to consistently present uncertified checks that will be honored by the debtor's financial institution.
(4) A U.S. Government check endorsed by the payee to the U.S. Customs Service, a domestic traveler's check, or a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order shall be accepted. Before accepting this form of payment the Customs cashier or other employee authorized to receive Customs collections shall require such identification in the way of a current driver's license issued by a state of the United States, or a current passport properly authenticated by the Department of State, or a current credit card issued by one of the numerous travel agencies or clubs, or other credit data, etc., from which he can verify the identity and signature of the person tendering such check or money order.
(5) The face amount of a bank draft, cashier's check, certified check, or uncertified check tendered in accordance with this paragraph shall not exceed the amount due by more than $1 and any required change is authorized to be made out of any available cash funds on hand.
(6) The face amount of a U.S. Government check, traveler's check, or money order tendered in accordance with this paragraph shall not exceed the amount due by more than $50 and any required change is authorized to be made out of any available cash funds on hand.
(7) Credit or charge cards, which have been authorized by the Commissioner of Customs, may be used for the payment of duties, taxes, fees, and/or other charges at designated Customs-serviced locations. Payment by this manner is limited to non-commercial entries and is subject to ultimate collection from the credit card company. Persons paying by charge or credit card will remain liable for all such charges until paid. Information as to those credit card companies authorized by Customs may be obtained from Customs officers.
(8) Participants in the Automated Broker Interface may use statement processing as described in § 24.25 of this part. Statement processing allows entry/entry summaries and entry summaries to be grouped by either importer or by filer, and allows payment of related duties, taxes and fees by a single payment, rather than by individual checks for each entry. The preferred method of payment for users of statement processing is by Automated Clearinghouse.
(b) At piers, terminals, bridges, airports and other similar places, in addition to the methods of payment prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, a personal check drawn on a national or state bank or trust company of the United States shall be accepted by Customs inspectors and other Customs employees authorized to receive Customs collections in payment of duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges on noncommercial importations, subject to the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section and this paragraph. Where the amount of the check is over $25, the Customs cashier or other employee authorized to receive Customs collections will ensure that the payor's name, home and business telephone number (including area code), and date of birth are recorded on the face (front) side of the monetary instrument. In addition, one of the following will be recorded on the face side of the instrument: preferably, the payor's social security number or, alternatively, a current passport number or current driver's license number (including issuing state). A personal check received under this paragraph and a United States Government
check, traveler's check, or money order received under paragraph (a) of this section by such Customs inspectors and other Customs employees shall also be subject to the following conditions:
(1) Where the amount is less than $100 and the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met, the Customs employee accepting the check or money order will place his name and badge number on the collection voucher and place the serial number or other form of voucher identification on the face side of the check or money order so that the check or money order can be easily associated with the voucher.
(2) Where the amount is $100 or more, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section the Customs employee accepting the check or money order shall obtain the approval of the Customs officer in charge who also shall personally verify the identification data and indicate his approval by initialing the collection voucher below the signature of the Customs employee who approved the receipt of the check or money order.
(3) A personal check tendered in accordance with this paragraph shall be accepted only when drawn for the amount of the duties, taxes, fees, and other charges to be paid by such check.
(c) Checks on foreign banks, foreign travelers' checks, and commercial drafts or bills of exchange subject to acceptance by the drawees shall not be accepted.
(d) Checks and other negotiable papers covering duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other Customs charges shall be made payable to the United States Customs Service.
(e) Any person who pays by check any duties, taxes, fees, interest, or other charges or obligations due the Customs Service which are not guaranteed by a Customs bond shall be assessed a charge of $30.00 for each check which is returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason, except the charge will not be assessed if it is shown that the maker of the check was not at fault in connection with the return of the check. This charge shall be in addition to any unpaid duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges.

§ 24.1a
Temporary postponement of deadline to deposit certain estimated duties, taxes, and fees because of the COVID-19 national emergency.
(a)
General.
Pursuant to the authority of 19 U.S.C. 1318(a), subject to the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, the deadline for the deposit of estimated duties, taxes, and fees that an importer of record would ordinarily be obligated to pay as of the date of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, of imported merchandise into the United States is postponed for a period of 90 days from the date that the deposit would otherwise have been due. No interest will accrue for the delayed deposit of such estimated duties, taxes, and fees during this 90-day temporary postponement.
(1) This temporary postponement applies only to entries, or withdrawals from warehouse, for consumption, made on or after March 1, 2020, and no later than April 30, 2020, by importers of record with a significant financial hardship. This temporary postponement does not permit return of any deposits of estimated duties, taxes, and/or fees that have been paid.
(2) An importer will be considered to have a significant financial hardship if the operation of such importer is fully or partially suspended during March or April 2020 due to orders from a competent governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings because of COVID-19, and as a result of such suspension, the gross receipts of such importer for March 13-31, 2020, or April 2020 are less than 60 percent of the gross receipts for the comparable period in 2019. An eligible importer need not file additional documentation with CBP to be eligible for this relief but must maintain documentation as part of its books and records establishing that it meets the requirements for relief.
(3) No penalty, liquidated damages claim, or other sanction will be imposed for the delayed deposit of estimated duties, taxes, and fees in accordance with a deadline postponed under this section.
(4) This temporary postponement does not apply to any entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, or any deposit of estimated duties, taxes, or fees for the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, where the entry summary includes any merchandise subject to one or more of the following: Antidumping duties (assessed pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1673
et seq.
), countervailing duties (assessed pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1671
et seq.
), duties assessed pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1862), duties assessed pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2251
et seq.
), and duties assessed pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411
et seq.
).
(b)
Time of entry.
For entries eligible for the temporary postponement of deposits under paragraph (a) of this section, the requirement to deposit estimated duties, taxes, and fees for the purpose of establishing the time of entry stated in 19 CFR 141.68 is waived.

Persons authorized to receive Customs collections.
Center directors, port directors, CBP cashiers, CBP officers, CBP dock tellers, and such other officers and employees as the Center director or port director will designate will receive Customs collections.
[CBP Dec. 16-26, 81 FR 93015, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 24.3
Bills and accounts; receipts.
(a) Any bill or account for money due the United States shall be rendered by an authorized Customs officer or employee on an official form.
(b) A receipt for the payment of estimated Customs duties, taxes, fees, and interest, if applicable, shall be provided a payer at the time of payment if he furnishes with his payment an additional copy of the documentation submitted in support of the payment. The appropriate Customs official shall validate the additional copy as paid and return it to the payer. Otherwise, a copy of the document filed by the payer and the payer's cancelled check shall constitute evidence of payment.
(c) A copy of a Customs bill validated as paid will not normally be provided a payer. If a bill is paid by check, the copy of the Customs bill identified as “Payer's Copy” and the payer's cancelled check shall constitute evidence of such payment to Customs. Should a payer desire evidence of receipt, both the “U.S. Customs Service Copy” and the “Payer's Copy” of the bill and, in the case of payments by mail, a stamped, self-addressed envelope, shall be submitted. The “Payer's Copy” of the bill shall then be marked paid by the appropriate Customs official and returned to the payer.
(d) Every payment which is not made in person shall be accompanied by the original bill or by a communication containing sufficient information to identify the account or accounts to which it is to be applied.
(e) Except for bills resulting from dishonored payments (
e.g.,
a check or Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transaction), all other bills for duties, taxes, fees, interest, or other charges are due and payable within 30 days of the date of the issuance of the bill. Bills resulting from dishonored payments are due and payable within 15 days of the date of the issuance of the bill.

§ 24.3a
CBP bills; interest assessment on bills; delinquency; notice to principal and surety.
(a)
Due date of CBP bills.
CBP bills for supplemental duties, taxes and fees(increased or additional duties, taxes, and fees assessed upon liquidation or reliquidation), or vessel repair duties, together with interest thereon, reimbursable services (such as provided for in §§ 24.16 and 24.17), and miscellaneous amounts (bills other than duties, taxes, reimbursable services, liquidated damages, fines, and penalties) are due as provided for in § 24.3(e).
(b)
Assessment of interest charges
—(1)
Bills for vessel repair duties, reimbursable services and miscellaneous amounts.
If payment is not received by CBP on or before the late payment date appearing on the bill, interest charges will be assessed upon the delinquent principal amount of the bill. The late payment date is the date 30 calendar days after the interest computation date. The interest computation date is the date from which interest is calculated and is initially the bill date.
(2)
Interest on supplemental duties, taxes, fees, and interest
—(i)
Initial interest accrual.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, interest assessed due to an underpayment of duties, taxes, fees, or interest will accrue from the date the importer of record is required to deposit estimated duties, taxes, fees, and interest to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:

# Example:
Entry underpaid as determined upon liquidation
ER20OC99.000
Importer owes $500 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,500 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be billed for $500 plus interest. The interest will accrue from the date payment was due (January 1) to date of liquidation (December 1).
(A) If a refund of duties, taxes, fees, or interest was made prior to liquidation or reliquidation and is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation to be excessive, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (b)(2)(i), interest also will accrue on the excess amount refunded from the date of the refund to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:

# Example:
Pre-liquidation refund but entry liquidates for an increase
ER20OC99.001
Importer owes $800 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and receives a pre-liquidation refund of $300 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,500 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be billed for $800 plus interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) On the original underpayment ($500) from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1); and (2) on the pre-liquidation refund ($300) from the date of the refund (May 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(B) The following rules will apply in the case of an additional deposit of duties, taxes, fees, or interest made prior to liquidation or reliquidation:
(
1
) If the additional deposit is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute the correct remaining balance that was required to
be deposited on the date the deposit was due, interest shall accrue on the amount of the additional deposit only from the date of the initial deposit until the date the additional deposit was made. An example follows:

# Example:
Additional deposit made and entry liquidates for total amount deposited
ER20OC99.002
Importer owes interest on $200 as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and an additional pre-liquidation deposit of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,200 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be billed for interest on the original $200 underpayment from the date of the initial deposit (January 1) to the date of the additional deposit (May 1).
(
2
) If the additional deposit is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to be less than the full balance owed on the amount initially required to be deposited, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (b)(2)(i), interest also will accrue on the remaining unpaid balance from the date deposit was initially required to the date of liquidation or reliquidation. An example follows:

# Example:
Additional deposit made and entry underpaid as determined upon liquidation
ER20OC99.003
Importer owes $300 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and an additional pre-liquidation deposit of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,500 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be billed for $300 plus interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) on the additional deposit ($200), from the date deposit was required (January 1) to the date of the additional deposit (May 1); and (2) on the remaining underpayment ($300), from the date deposit was required (January 1), to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(
3
) If an entry or reconciliation is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation to involve both an excess deposit and an excess refund made prior to liquidation or reliquidation, interest in each case will be computed separately and the resulting amounts shall be netted for purposes of determining the final amount of interest to be reflected in the underpaid amount. An example follows:

# Example:
Excess pre-liquidation deposit and excess pre-liquidation refund
ER20OC99.004
Importer owes $200 plus or minus net interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and receives a pre-liquidation refund of $300 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $900 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be billed for $200 plus or minus net interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) Interest accrues in favor of the importer on the initial overpayment ($100) from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of the refund (May 1); and (2) interest accrues in favor of the Government on the refund overpayment ($200) from the date of the refund (May 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(
4
) If the additional deposit or any portion thereof is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute a payment in excess of the amount initially required to be deposited, the excess deposit will be treated as a refundable amount on which interest also may be payable (see § 24.36).
(ii)
Interest on overdue bills.
If duties, taxes, fees, and interest are not paid in full within the applicable period specified in § 24.3(e), any unpaid balance will be considered delinquent and shall bear interest until the full balance is paid.
(3)
Interest accrual on debit vouchers.
If a depository bank notifies CBP by a debit voucher that a CBP account is being debited due to a dishonored payment (
e.g.,
a check or Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transaction), interest will accrue on the debited amount from the date of the bill resulting from the dishonored payment. If payment is not received by CBP on or before the late payment date appearing on the bill, interest charges will be assessed on the debited amount. The initial late payment date is the date 15 days after the interest computation date. The interest computation date is the date from which interest is calculated and is initially the bill date. No interest charge will be assessed where the payment is actually received at the “Send Payment To” location designated on the bill within the initial 15-day period. After the initial 15-day period, interest will be assessed in 30-day periods pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Interest rate and applicability.
(1) The percentage rate of interest to be charged on such bills will be based upon the quarterly rate(s) established under sections 6621 and 6622 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 6621, 6622). The current rate of interest will appear on the CBP bill and may be obtained from the IRS or the CBP's Revenue Division, Office of Administration. For the convenience of the importing public and CBP personnel, CBP publishes the current interest rate(s) in the
Customs Bulletin and Decisions
and
Federal Register
on a quarterly basis.
(2) The percentage rate of interest applied to an overdue bill will be adjusted as necessary to reflect any change in the annual rate of interest.
(3) Interest on overdue bills will be assessed on the delinquent principal amount by 30-day periods. No interest charge will be assessed for the 30-day period in which the payment is actually received at the “Send Payment To” location designated on the bill.
(4) In the case of any late payment, the payment received will first be applied to the interest charge on the delinquent principal amount and then to payment of the delinquent principal amount.
(5) The date to be used in crediting the payment is the date on which the payment is received by CBP.
(d)
Notice
—(1)
Principal.
The principal will be notified at the time of the initial billing, and every 30 days after the due date until the bill is paid or otherwise closed. Where the notification is returned to CBP due to an incorrect mailing address, the bill may be stopped. The following elements will normally appear on the bill:
(i) Principal amount due;
(ii) Interest computation date;
(iii) Late payment date;
(iv) Accrual of interest charges if payment is not received by the late payment date;
(v) Applicable current interest rate;
(vi) Amount of interest owed;
(vii) CBP office where requests for administrative adjustments due to billing errors may be addressed; and
(viii) Transaction identification (e.g., entry number, reimbursable assignment number).
(2)
Surety.
(i) CBP will report outstanding bills on a Formal Demand on Surety for Payment of Delinquent Amounts Due, for bills more than 30 days past due (approximately 60 days after bill due date), and every month thereafter until the bill is paid or otherwise closed. The following elements will normally appear on the report:
(A) Principal amount due;
(B) Interest computation date;
(C) Late payment date;
(D) Accrual of interest charges if payment is not received by the late payment date;
(E) Applicable current interest rate;

§ 24.4
Optional method for payment of estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages upon entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.
(a)
Application to defer.
An importer, including a transferee of alcoholic beverages in a Customs bonded warehouse who wishes to pay on a semi-monthly basis the estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption by him during such a period may apply by letter to the Center director, either at a port of entry or electronically. If the importer desires the additional privilege of depositing estimated tax payments on an extended deferred basis, it must be specifically requested. An importer who receives approval from the Center director to defer such payments may, however, continue to pay the estimated import taxes due at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.
(b)
Deferred payment periods.
A period shall commence on October 24 and run through October 31, 1965; thereafter the periods shall run from the 1st day of each month through the 15th day of that month, and from the 16th day of each month through the last day of that month. An importer may begin the deferral of payments of estimated tax to a Customs port in the first deferral period beginning after the date of the written approval by the Center director. An importer may use the deferred payment system until the Center director advises such importer that he is no longer eligible to defer the payment of such taxes.
(c)
Content of application and supporting documents.
(1) An importer must state his estimate of the largest amount of taxes to be deferred in any semimonthly period based on the largest amount of import taxes on alcoholic beverages deposited with CBP in such a period during the year preceding his application. He must also identify any existing bond or bonds that he has on file with CBP and shall submit in support of his application the approval of the surety on his bond or bonds to the use of the procedure and to the increase of such bond or bonds to such larger amount or amounts as may be found necessary by the Center director.
(2) Each application must include a declaration in substantially the following language:
I declare that I am not presently barred by CBP from using the deferred payment procedure for payment of estimated taxes upon imports of alcoholic beverages, and that if I am notified by a Center director to such effect I shall advise any future Center director where approval has been given to me to use such procedure.
(d)
Use of deferred payment method.
(1) The Center director will notify the importer, or his authorized agent if requested, of approval.
(2) An importer who has received approval to make deferred payments retains the option of deferring or depositing the estimated tax on imported alcoholic beverages until the entry or withdrawal is presented to the cashier for payment of estimated duties. At the time the importer presents his entry or withdrawal for consumption to the cashier together with the estimated duty, he must either pay the estimated tax or indicate on the entry or withdrawal that he elects to defer the tax payment.
(e)
Tax deferment procedure.
If the importer elects to defer the tax payments, he shall enter on each copy of the entry or withdrawal the words “Tax Payment Deferred,” adjacent to the amount shown on the documents as estimated taxes, before presentation to the cashier.
(f)
Payment procedure
—(1)
Billing.
Each importer who has deferred tax payments on imported alcoholic beverages will be billed on Customs Form 6084, United States Customs Service Bill, at the end of each tax deferred period for all taxes deferred during the period. Each bill will identify each tax amount deferred and the related entry numbers. These bills must be paid in fully by the last day of the next succeeding deferral period.
(2)
Interest on overdue accounts.
When any bill for deferred taxes is not paid within the period specified in subparagraph (f)(1) of this section, interest thereon from the date following the end of the specified period to the date of payment of the bill shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as the basic tax. The rate of interest to be assessed shall be 7 percent per annum or such other rate as is established by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6621(b).
(g)
Restrictions on deferring tax deposits.
An importer may not on one entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, deposit part of the estimated tax and defer the balance of the tax. The estimated tax on each entry or withdrawal must be either fully paid or deferred.
(h)
Termination of deferred payment privilege.
(1) When any bill on Customs Form 6084 for deferred taxes is not paid within the period specified in paragraph (f) of this section, a demand for payment shall be made to the surety on the importer's bond. If in the opinion of the customs officer concerned such failure to make timely payment of estimated deferred taxes warrants the withdrawal of the tax deferral privilege, he will advise the importer of the withdrawal of such privilege. In all instances of failure to pay timely the deferred taxes on alcoholic beverages withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, further withdrawals from the warehouse entry on which the tax is delinquent will be refused until payment is made of the amount delinquent.
(2) The termination at any port of the tax deferral privilege for failure to pay timely any deferred estimated tax shall be at the discretion of the Customs officer concerned. Termination of the privilege for any other reason shall be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Customs. Notice of termination of the tax deferral privilege at any port will be disseminated to all other Customs ports.
(3) Renewal of the tax deferral privilege after it has been withdrawn at any port may be made only upon approval of the Commissioner of Customs.
(i)
Duration of deferred payment privilege.
The deferred payment privilege once approved by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, will remain in effect until terminated under the provisions of paragraph (h) or the importer or surety requests termination.
(j)
Entries for consumption or warehouse after an importer is delinquent.
An importer who is delinquent in paying deferred taxes may make entries for consumption or for warehousing, or withdrawals for consumption from warehouse entries on which no delinquency exists, upon deposit of all estimated duties or taxes.
(k)
Rate of tax.
The estimated taxes must be paid on the basis of the rates in effect upon entry, or withdrawal
from warehouse, for consumption, unless in accordance with section 315 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, another date is applicable and not on the basis of the rates of tax in effect on the date deferred payment is made.

§ 24.5
Filing identification number.
(a)
Generally.
Each person, business firm, Government agency, or other organization shall file Customs Form 5106, Notification of Importer's Number or Application for Importer's Number, or Notice of Change of Name or Address, with the first formal entry which is submitted or the first request for services that will result in the issuance of a bill or a refund check upon adjustment of a cash collection. A Customs Form 5106 shall also be filed for the ultimate consignee for which such entry is being made. Customs Form 5106 may be obtained from any Customs Office.
(b)
Preparation of Customs Form 5106.
(1) The identification number to be used when filing Customs Form 5106 shall be:
(i) The Internal Revenue Service employer identification number, or
(ii) If no Internal Revenue Service employer identification number has been assigned, the Social Security number.
(2) If neither an Internal Revenue Service employer identification number nor a Social Security number has been assigned, the word “None” shall be written on the line provided for each of these numbers on Customs Form 5106 and the form shall be filed in duplicate.
(c)
Assignment of importer identification number.
Upon receipt of a Customs Form 5106 without an Internal Revenue Service employer identification number or a Social Security number, an importer identification number shall be assigned and entered on the Customs Form 5106 by the Customs office where the entry or request for services is received. The duplicate copy of the form shall be returned to the filing party. This identification number shall be used in all future Customs transactions when an importer number is required. If an Internal Revenue Service employer identification number, a Social Security number, or both, are obtained after an importer number has been assigned by Customs, a new Customs Form 5106 shall not be filed unless requested by Customs.
(d)
Optional additional identification.
Customs Form 5106 contains blocks for a two-digit suffix code which may be written in as an addition to the Internal Revenue Service employer identification number to provide optional additional identification. The two-digit suffix code may be used by a business firm having branch office operations to permit the firm to identify transactions originating in its branch offices, or by vessel owners to permit them to identify transactions associated with particular vessels. A separate Customs Form 5106 shall be required to report the specific suffix code and the name and address for each branch office or vessel to be identified. Transactions may be associated with a specific branch office or vessel by reporting the appropriate identification number, including the two-digit suffix code, on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or the request for services. Suffix codes may be either numeric, alphabetic, or a combination of both numeric and alphabetic, except that the letters O, Z, and I may not be used. The blocks may be left blank if the firm or vessel owner has no use for them and a “00” suffix will be automatically assigned.
(e)
Retention of importer identification number.
An importer identification number shall remain on file until 1 year from the date on which it is last used on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or a request for services. If not used for 1 year and there is no outstanding transaction to which it must be associated, the importer identification number will be removed from Customs files. To engage in future transactions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the person, business firm, Government agency, or other organization, previously covered by an
importer identificatign number, must file another Customs Form 5106.
(f)
“Freezing” importer identification information.
Those importers identifying Customs transactions through the procedure specified in paragraph (d) of this section and desiring to ensure that they receive such Customs transaction notifications as may be issued may request Customs to “freeze” the name and address information, regardless of what is shown on the Customs Form 5106 or request for services, by designating the name and title/position of the individual in their company authorized to effect name/address changes to the Importer's Record Number (IRN) identification information, and specifying the IRNs and suffixes to be frozen and the mailing address and/or physical location address of the company where Customs notifications are to be directed. The request must be made in a separate writing on letterhead paper signed by the importer of record or his agent, whose name and title are clearly indicated. Participation in the “Freeze” Program is voluntary. Requests to participate should be sent to: the National Finance Center, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Administration, Revenue Division, 6650 Telecom Drive, Suite 100, Indianapolis, IN 46278, Attn: Freeze Program.

§ 24.11
Notice to importer or owner of increased or additional duties, taxes, fees and interest.
Any increased or additional duties, taxes, fees or interest found due upon liquidation or reliquidation shall be billed to the importer of record, or to the actual owner if the following have been filed with Customs:
(a) A declaration of the actual owner in accordance with section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), and § 141.20 of this chapter; and
(b) A bond on Customs Form 301 in accordance with § 141.20 of this chapter.
[T.D. 99-75, 64 FR 56439, Oct. 20, 1999]
§ 24.12
Customs fees; charges for storage.
(a) The following schedule of fees prescribed by law or hereafter in this paragraph shall be made available to the public at all Customs offices. When payment of such fee is received by a Customs employee a receipt therefor shall be issued.
(1) [Reserved]
(2) No fee will be charged for furnishing an official certificate if the request is made to Customs at the time the entry summary is filed. However, Customs shall charge and collect a fee of $10.00 for each hour or fraction thereof for time spent by each clerical, professional or supervisor in finding the documents and furnishing an official certification if the request is made after the entry documents are filed, plus a charge of 15 cents per page for photcopying. The fee may be revised periodically by publication of a general notice in the
Federal Register
and
Customs Bulletin
setting forth the revised fee. The published revised fee shall remain in effect until changed.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) The rates charged for storage in Government-owned or rented buildings shall not be less than the charges made at the port by commercial concerns for the storage and handling of merchandise. Except as to an examination package covered by an application for an entry by appraisement, storage shall be charged on any examination package for any period it remains in the appraiser's store after 2 full working days following the day on which the permit to release or transfer was issued. As to an examination package covered by an application for an entry by appraisement, storage shall be charged for any period it remains in the appraiser's store after 2 full working days following the day of issuance to the importer of oral or written notice of the amount of duties or taxes required to be deposited or that the package is ready for delivery. If the port director finds that circumstances make it impractical to remove examination packages from the appraiser's store within the 2-day period, he may extend the period for not to exceed 3
additional working days, without storage charges. In computing the 2 working days, and any authorized extension, (1) the day on which the permit to release or transfer is issued, or the day on which the notice is issued of the amount of duties or taxes that shall be deposited or that the package is ready for delivery, whichever is applicable, (2) Saturdays, (3) Sundays, and (4) National holidays, shall be excluded.
(d) Pursuant to the progressive clearance procedures set forth in § 122.88 of this chapter, when airlines commingle domestic (stopover) passengers who have already cleared Customs at their port of arrival and are continuing on to another U.S. destination, with international passengers who are arriving at their port of arrival and have not yet cleared Customs, a progressive clearance fee of $2.00 per domestic (stopover) passenger reinspection in the U.S. will be charged by Customs to the affected airlines to offset the additional cost to Customs of reinspecting passengers who have already been cleared. The fee is in addition to any other charges currently incurred, such as overtime services, but will not apply to passengers reinspected on an overtime basis if the cost of performing such reinspection is reimbursed to Customs in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1451. The fee will not apply to the reinspection of non-revenue producing passengers, including but not limited to, employees of the carrier and their dependents, deadhead crew, employees of other carriers who may be assessed a service charge by the transporting carrier, and other persons to whom the carrier is authorized to provide free transportation pursuant to 14 CFR part 233. The airline industry will be notified at least 90 days in advance of the date of any change in the amount of the fee necessitated by either an increase or decrease in costs to Customs, but no new fee shall take effect before January 1, 1986.

(1) If the seal is to be purchased and used by U.S. Customs, the seal or fastening, as appropriate, shall be marked to show that it is a U.S. Customs seal by application of the words “U.S. Customs” and a unique identification number on the seal.
(2) If the seal is to be used by private industry (i.e., a shipper, manufacturer, or carrier), it must be clearly and legibly marked with a unique company name (or logotype) and identification number.
(e)
Customs acceptance.
Seals will be considered as acceptable for use and/or purchase by U.S. Customs as soon as the manufacturer attests that the seals have been tested and meet or exceed the standards provided in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and will continue to be considered acceptable until such time as it is demonstrated that they do not meet the standards. A manufacturer may attest to the qualification of a specific seal, or to an entire product line of seals as of a certain date. Any addition of a seal to a group of seals attested to as a group would require specific acceptance of that seal by Customs.
(f)
Testing.
All testing of seals deemed necessary before Customs acceptance will be done by the manufacturer or by a private laboratory, and not by Customs. However, Customs reserves the right to test, or to have tested, seals that have been accepted by Customs.
(g)
Records.
The manufacturer's attestation that a seal meets or exceeds the standards specified in this section and, if deemed necessary by Customs, the seal test record shall be sent to the Assistant Commissioner, Field Operations, Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service, Washington DC 20229.

(d)
Work assignment priorities.
The establishment of regularly-scheduled administrative tours of duty and assignments of Customs Officers to overtime work under this section shall be made in accordance with the following priorities, listed below in priority order:
(1)
Alignment.
Tours of duty should be aligned with the Customs workload.
(2)
Least cost.
All work assignments should be made in a manner which minimizes the cost to the government or party in interest. Decisions, including, but not limited to, what hours should be covered by a tour of duty or whether an assignment should be treated as a continuous assignment or subject to commute compensation, should be based on least cost considerations. However, base pay comparison of eligible employees shall not be used in the determination of staffing assignments.
(3)
Annuity integrity.
For Customs Officers within 3 years of their statutory retirement eligibility, the amount of overtime that can be worked is limited to the average yearly number of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of Customs.
(e)
Overtime pay.
(1) A Customs Officer who is officially assigned to perform work in excess of the 40 hours in the officer's regularly-scheduled administrative workweek or in excess of 8 hours in a day shall be compensated for such overtime work performed at 2 times the hourly rate of the officer's base pay, including any locality pay, but not including any premium pay differentials for holiday, Sunday, or night work.
(2) The computation of the amount of overtime worked by a Customs Officer is subject to the following conditions:
(i)
Overtime that is less than one hour.
A quarter of an hour shall be the smallest fraction of an hour used for paying overtime under this subpart.
(ii)
Absence during overtime.
Except as expressly authorized by statute, regulation, or court order (i.e., military leave, court leave, continuation of pay under the workers compensation law, and back pay awards), a Customs Officer shall be paid for overtime work only when the officer reports as assigned.
(f)
Special provisions relating to overtime work on a callback basis
—(1)
Minimum duration and callback requirements.
Any work for which overtime pay is authorized and for which the Customs Officer is required to return to a place of work shall be treated as being at least 2 hours in duration, but only if such work begins at least 1 hour after the end of any previous regularly-scheduled work assignment and ends at least 1 hour before the beginning of the following regularly-scheduled work assignment. An unpaid meal period shall not be considered a break in service for purposes of callback.
(2)
Commute compensation—Eligibility.
A Customs Officer shall be compensated for overtime when the officer is called back and officially assigned to perform work that:
(i) Is in excess of the 40 hours in the officer's regularly-scheduled administrative workweek or in excess of 8 hours in a day;
(ii) Begins at least 1 hour after the end of any previous regularly-scheduled work assignment;
(iii) Commences more than 2 hours prior to the start of the officer's next regularly-scheduled work assignment;
(iv) Ends at least 1 hour before the beginning of the officer's next regularly-scheduled work assignment; and,
(v) Commences less than 16 hours after the officer's last regularly-scheduled work assignment. The 16 hours shall be calculated from the end of the Customs Officer's last regularly-scheduled work assignment.
(3)
Commute compensation—Amount.
Commute compensation under this section shall be in an amount equal to 3 times the hourly rate of the Customs Officer's base pay for a one hour period, which includes applicable locality pay, but does not include any premium pay differentials for holiday, Sunday or night work. The Customs Officer shall be entitled to this amount for an eligible commute regardless of the actual commute time. However, an unpaid meal period shall not be considered a break in service for purposes of commute compensation.
(4)
Maximum compensation for multiple assignments.
If a Customs Officer is assigned to perform more than one overtime assignment, in which the officer is required to return to a place of work more than once in order to complete the assignment, and otherwise satisfies the callback requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the officer shall be entitled to commute compensation each time the officer returns to the place of work provided that each assignment commences less than 16 hours after the officer's last regularly-scheduled work assignment. However, in no case shall the compensation be greater than if some or all of the assignments were treated as one continuous callback assignment.
(g)
Premium pay differentials.
Premium pay differentials may only be paid for non-overtime work performed on holidays, Sundays, or, at night (work performed, in whole or in part, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.). A Customs Officer shall receive payment for only one of the differentials for any one given period of work. The order of precedence for the payment of premium pay differentials is holiday, Sunday, and night work.
(1)
Holiday differential.
A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled work on a holiday shall receive pay for that work at the officer's hourly rate of base pay, which includes authorized locality pay, plus premium pay amounting to 100 percent of that base rate. Holiday differential premium pay will be paid only for time worked. Intermittent employees are not entitled to holiday differentials.
(i) When a holiday is designated by a calendar date, for example, January 1, July 4, November 11, or December 25, the holiday will be observed on that date regardless of Saturdays and Sundays. Customs Officers who perform regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tours of duty on those days shall be paid the holiday differential. Holidays not designated by a specific calendar date, such as President's Day (the third Monday in February), shall be observed on that date, and Customs Officers who perform regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, work on those days shall be paid the holiday differential.
(ii) Inauguration Day (January 20 of each fourth year after 1965), is a legal public holiday for the purpose of the Act. Customs Officers whose duty locations are in the District of Columbia, or Montgomery and Prince George counties in Maryland, or Arlington and Fairfax counties in Virginia, or in the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church in Virginia, who perform regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, work on that day shall be paid the holiday differential. When Inauguration Day falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day selected for the public observance of the inauguration of the President is the legal public holiday.
(iii) If a legal holiday falls on a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled day off, the officer shall receive a holiday “in lieu of” that day. Holidays “in lieu of” shall not be granted for Inauguration Day. A Customs Officer who works on an “in lieu of” holiday shall be paid the holiday differential.
(iv) If a Customs Officer is assigned to a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tour of duty which contains hours within and outside the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday—for example, a tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on a Monday holiday following a scheduled day off on Sunday and ending at 4 a.m. on Tuesday—the Customs Officer shall receive the holiday differential (up to 8 hours) for work performed during that
shift. If the Customs Officer is assigned more than one regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tour of duty which contains hours within and outside the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday—for example, a tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on the Wednesday before a Thursday holiday and ending at 4 a.m. on Thursday with another regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on the Thursday holiday and ending at 4 a.m. on Friday—the management official in charge of assigning work shall designate one of the tours of duty as the officer's holiday shift and the officer shall receive holiday differential (up to 8 hours) for work performed during the entire period of the designated holiday shift. The Customs Officer shall not receive holiday differential for any of the work performed on the tour of duty which has not been designated as the holiday shift but will be eligible for Sunday or night differential as appropriate.
(v) Customs Officers who are regularly scheduled, but not required, to work on a holiday shall receive their hourly rate of base pay for that 8-hour tour plus any Sunday or night differential they would have received had the day not been designated as a holiday. To receive holiday pay under this paragraph, the Customs Officer must be in a pay status (at work or on paid leave), either the last work day before the holiday or the first work day following the holiday.
(vi) A Customs Officer who works only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday shift will be paid the holiday differential for the actual hours worked and the appropriate differential (Sunday or night) for the remaining portion of the shift such officer was not required to work. The night differential premium pay shall be calculated based on the rate applicable to the entire shift.
(2)
Sunday differential.
A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled work on a Sunday that is not a Federal holiday shall receive pay for that work at the officer's hourly rate of base pay, which includes authorized locality pay, plus premium pay amounting to 50 percent of that base rate. Sunday differential premium pay will be paid only for time worked and is not applicable to overtime work performed on a Sunday. A Customs Officer whose regularly-scheduled work occurs in part on a Sunday, that is not a Federal holiday, and in part on the preceding or following day, will receive the Sunday differential premium pay for the hours worked between 12:01 a.m. and 12 Midnight on Sunday. Intermittent employees are not entitled to Sunday differentials.
(3)
Night work differentials.
A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled night work shall receive pay for that work at the officer's hourly rate of base pay, including locality pay as authorized, plus the applicable premium pay differential, as specified below, but shall not receive such night differential for work performed during overtime assignments. When all or the majority of the hours of a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled work occur between 3 p.m. and 8 a.m., the officer shall receive a night differential premium for all the hours worked during that assignment. Intermittent employees are not entitled to night differentials.
(i)
3 p.m. to Midnight.
If more than half of the hours of a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled shift occur between the hours of 3 p.m. and 12 Midnight, the officer shall be paid at the officer's hourly rate of base pay and shall also be paid a premium of 15 percent of that hourly rate of base pay for all the hours worked.
(ii)
11 p.m. to 8 a.m.
If more than half of the hours of a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled shift occur between the hours of 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., the officer shall be paid at the officer's hourly rate of base pay and shall also be paid a premium of 20 percent of that hourly rate of base pay for all the hours worked.
(iii)
7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. Shift.
If the regularly-scheduled shift of a Customs Officer is 7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m., the officer shall be paid at the officer's hourly rate of base pay and shall also be paid a premium of 15 percent of that hourly rate of base pay for the work performed between 7:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. and 20 percent of that hourly rate of base pay for the work performed between 11:30 p.m. and 3:30 a.m.
(iv)
Work scheduled during two differential periods.
A Customs Officer shall only be paid one night differential rate per regularly-scheduled shift, except as provided for in paragraph (iii) above. A Customs Officer whose regularly-scheduled work occurs during two separate differential periods shall receive the night differential premium rate which applies to the majority of hours scheduled.
(v)
Night work which occurs in part on a Sunday.
When a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled shift occurs in part on a Sunday, the officer shall receive Sunday differential pay for those hours of the work which are performed during the 24 hour period of the Sunday, and the night differential pay for those hours which do not fall on the Sunday. For example, a Customs Officer who is assigned and works a shift which starts at 8 p.m. Sunday and ends at 4 a.m. Monday, shall receive 4 hours of Sunday premium pay and 4 hours of night pay. The night differential pay shall be calculated based on the rate applicable to the particular tour of duty.
(h)
Limitations.
Total payments for overtime/commute, and differentials for holiday, Sunday, and night work that a Customs Officer is paid shall not exceed any applicable fiscal year pay cap established by Congress. The Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee may waive this limitation in individual cases to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of the Customs Service. However, compensation awarded to a Customs Officer for work not performed, which includes overtime awards during military leave or court leave, continuation of pay under workers compensation law, and awards made in accordance with back pay settlements, shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations.

(a) Amounts of compensation and expenses chargeable to parties-in-interest in connection with services rendered by CBP employees during regular hours of duty or on Customs overtime assignments (19 U.S.C. 267, 1451), under one or more of the following circumstances shall be collected from such parties-in-interest and deposited by port directors as repayments to the appropriation from which paid.
(1) When a CBP employee is assigned on board a vessel or vehicle under authority of section 457, Tariff Act of 1930, to protect the revenue, the owner or master of such vessel or vehicle shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.
(2) When a CBP employee is assigned on board a vessel under authority of section 458, Tariff Act of 1930, to supervise the unlading of such vessel, the master or owner of such vessel shall be charged the full compensation of such employee for every day consumed in unlading after the expiration of 25 days after the date of the vessel's entry.
(3) When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to supervise the exportation, destruction, or marking to exempt articles from the duty provided for in such section, the importer of such merchandise shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.

When a CBP employee is so assigned to render service in connection with the entry or delivery of merchandise only, the private interest shall be charged only for the authorized travel and subsistence expenses incurred by such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto except
that no collection need be made if the total amount chargeable against one importer for one day amounts to less than 50 cents (see § 101.4(b) of this chapter). Where the amount chargeable is 50 cents or more, but less than $1, a minimum charge of $1 shall be made.

(b) When a CBP employee is assigned to render services the nature of which is such that the private interest is required to reimburse the Government for his compensation and on the same assignment performs services for which compensation is not reimbursable, a charge shall be made to the private interest for the full compensation of the CBP employee unless the time devoted to each class of service can be clearly segregated.
(c) The charge for any service enumerated in this section for which expenses are required to be reimbursed shall include actual transportation expenses of a CBP employee within the port limits and any authorized travel expenses of a CBP employee, including per diem, when the services are performed outside the port limits irrespective of whether the services are performed during a regular tour of duty or during a Customs overtime assignment. No charge shall be made for transportation expenses when a CBP employee is reporting to as a first daily assignment, or leaving from as a last
daily assignment, a place within or outside the port limits where he is assigned to a regular tour of duty. No charge shall be made for transportation expenses within the port limits or travel expenses, including per diem, outside the port limits in connection with a Customs overtime assignment for which reimbursement of expenses is not covered by this section.

When such services are performed by an intermittent when-actually-employed employee, the charge for such services shall be computed at a rate per hour equal to 108 percent of the hourly rate of the regular pay of such employee to provide for reimbursement of the Government's contribution under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, as amended (25 U.S.C. 3101,
et seq.),
and employee uniform allowance. The time charged shall include any time within the regular working hours of the employee required for travel between the duty assignment and the place where the employee is regularly employed excluding lunch periods, charged in multiples of 1 hour, any fractional part of an hour to be charged as 1 hour when the services are performed during the regularly scheduled tour of duty of the officer or between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays when the officer has no regularly scheduled tour of duty. In no case shall the charge be less than $1.
(2) The necessary transportation expenses and any authorized per diem expenses of a CBP employee assigned to perform reimbursable services at a location at which he is not regularly assigned shall be reimbursed by the responsible party.
(3) When a CBP employee is regularly assigned to duty at more than one location, the charge for his compensation and transportation expenses in going from one location to another shall be equitably apportioned among the parties concerned. However, no charge shall be made for transportation expenses when a CBP employee is reporting to as a first assignment, or leaving from as a last assignment, a place where he is regularly assigned to duty.
(4) Upon a failure to pay such charges when due, or to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, the port director shall report the facts to the Accounting Services—Accounts Receivable, which shall take appropriate action to collect the charges.
(e) The reimbursable charge for customs overtime compensation shall be computed in accordance with § 24.16.
(f)
Medicare compensation costs.
In addition to other expenses and compensation chargeable to parties-in-interest as set forth in this section, such persons shall also be required to reimburse Customs in the amount of 1.35 percent
of the reimbursable compensation expenses incurred. Such payment will reimburse Customs for its share of Medicare costs.

§ 24.18
Preclearance of air travelers in a foreign country; reimbursable cost.
(a) Preclearance is the tentative examination and inspection of air travelers and their baggage at foreign places where U.S. Customs personnel are stationed for that purpose.
(b) At the request of an airline, travelers on a direct flight to the United States from a foreign place described in paragraph (a) of this section may be precleared prior to departure from such place. A charge based on the excess cost to Customs of providing preclearance services as defined in paragraph (c) of this section shall be made to the airline.
(c) The reimbursable excess cost is the difference between the cost of examining and inspecting air travelers and their baggage upon arrival in the United States assuming no preclearance was provided, and the cost of providing preclearance for air travelers at the place of departure. Such excess cost shall include all items attributable to the preclearance operation. This does not include the salary of personnel regularly assigned to a preclearance station other than approved salary differentials related to the foreign assignment and the salary of relief details made necessary by reason of the nature of the operation. In addition, such cost shall include the following allowances and expenses:
(1) Housing allowances;
(2) Post of duty allowances;
(3) Education allowances;
(4) Transportation cost incident to the assignment to the foreign station and return, including transportation of family and household effects;
(5) Home leave and associated transportation costs; and
(6) Equipment, supplies and administrative costs including costs of supervising the preclearance installation.
(d) The reimbursable excess cost described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be determined for each preclearance installation. On the basis of the excess cost figure for each installation, the excess cost of providing preclearance service for a biweekly pay period shall be determined. The initial schedule of biweekly excess cost will be based on the actual excess cost for fiscal year 1969. Thereafter, a quarterly (ending with the pay period closely corresponding to June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31) cost analysis will be conducted and the schedule of biweekly excess costs will be adjusted so that the current biweekly excess cost schedule will reflect the actual excess costs of the previous quarter. Such schedules of biweekly costs for each installation shall be published in the
Federal Register.
The biweekly excess cost in effect at an installation at the time the charge is made shall be used in calculating the prorated charge for preclearance service for each airline in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(e) The charge to each airline for preclearance service shall be its prorated share of the applicable excess cost prorated to the aircraft receiving such services during the billing period on the following basis:
(1) Five percent shall be distributed equally among the airlines serviced.
(2) Ten percent shall be distributed proportionately as the number of clearances serviced bears to the total number of clearances.
(3) Eighty-five percent shall be distributed proportionately as the number of passengers and/or crew serviced for each airline bears to the total number of passengers and/or crew serviced.
(f) Customs services for which overtime compensation is provided for by section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended (19 U.S.C. 267), and the expenses recovered thereunder are governed by § 24.16 and are in no way affected by this section. (63 Stat. 290; 31 U.S.C. 483a)

The cost of the charge for administrative overhead shall be 15 percent of the compensation and/or expenses of the Customs officers performing the service.

§ 24.22
Fees for certain services.
This section sets forth the terms and conditions for when the fees and corresponding limitations for certain services are required. Except as provided in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, the specific customs user fee amounts and corresponding limitations that appear in this section are not the actual fees or limitations but represent the base year amounts that are subject to adjustment each fiscal year in accordance with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) using Fiscal Year 2014 as the base year for comparison. (
See
appendix A to part 24 for a table setting forth the fees and limitations subject to adjustment along with the corresponding statutory authority, the regulatory citation, the name of the fee or limitation, and the Fiscal Year 2014 base amount which reflects the statutory amounts that were adjusted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-357).) The methodology for adjusting the fees and limitations to reflect the percentage, if any, of the increase in the average of the Consumer Price Index—All Urban Consumers, U.S. All items, 1982-84
(CPI-U) for the preceding 12-month period (June through May) compared to the Consumer Price Index for fiscal year 2014 is set forth in paragraph (k) of this section. CBP will determine annually whether an adjustment to the fees and limitations is necessary and a notice specifying the amount of the fees and limitations will be published in the
Federal Register
annually for each fiscal year at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the new fees and limitations. The fees and the limitations will also be maintained for the public's convenience on the CBP Web site at
www.cbp.gov.
If a customs user has pre-paid or met the calendar year limit prior to the effective date of the new fees and limitations, no additional fees will be required for that calendar year. If the customs user has not pre-paid or met the calendar year limit prior to the effective date of the new fees and limitations, the customs user will be subject to the adjusted limitation or prepayment amount.

Adjustment for inflation of Customs Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) user fees
—(1)
Fee amounts.
CBP will determine annually whether an adjustment to the fees and limitations is necessary and a notice specifying the amount of the fees and limitations, as adjusted, will be published in the
Federal Register
annually for each fiscal year at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the new fees and limitations. The fee and limitation amounts will also be maintained for the public's convenience on the CBP Web site at
www.cbp.gov.
(2)
Methodology for annual adjustments of fees and limitation amounts for inflation.
CBP will determine the adjustments, if any, by making the following calculations:
(i) Calculate the arithmetic average of the Consumer Price Index—All Urban Consumers, U.S. All items, 1982-84 = 100 (CPI-U) for the current year based on the most recent June-May period. This figure is referred to as (A).
(ii) Calculate the arithmetic average of the CPI-U for FY 2014. This figure is referred to as (B).
(iii) State the arithmetic average of CPI-U for the comparison year which will be either (B) if the fees have never been adjusted in accordance with this paragraph (k), or the arithmetic average of the CPI-U for the last year in which fees were adjusted in accordance with this paragraph (k) as set forth in the
Federal Register
notice that last adjusted the fee. This figure is referred to as (C).
(iv) Calculate the difference between the arithmetic averages of the CPI-U of the comparison year (C) and the current year (A). This difference is referred to as (D). (D) = (A)−(C).
(v) Round the difference (D) to the nearest whole number. This figure is referred to as (E).
(vi) Calculate the percentage change in the arithmetic averages of the CPI-U of the comparison year (C) and the current year (A) which is referred to as (F). (F) = ((E) ÷ (C)) × 100%.
(vii) If (F) is one percent or more, proceed to the next step (viii). If (F) is less than one percent, no adjustment will be made.
(viii) Calculate the difference in the arithmetic average of the CPI-U between the current year (the most recent June through May period) and the base year (FY 2014). This difference is referred to as (G). (G) = (A)−(B).
(ix) Calculate the percentage change in the CPI-U from the base year to the current year. This figure is referred to as (H). (H) = ((G) ÷ (B)) × 100%.
(x) Increase the fees and limitations that are subject to the rules of this paragraph by (H), calculating fees and limitations to the second decimal.

Domestic vessel movements
—(i)
Time and place of liability.
Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when cargo is loaded on a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section to be transported between ports in the U.S. or is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section after having been transported between ports in the U.S., the shipper (the person or corporation who pays the freight) of that cargo is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee will be imposed only once on a movement pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The fee is to be based upon the value of the cargo as determined by standard commercial documentation where such documentation is available. Otherwise, the value is to be determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a as if it were imported merchandise. The Vessel Operation Report (Army Corps of Engineers Form 3925) is to be completed and submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with the procedures set forth in 33 CFR Ch. II, part 207. The shipper's name, either the internal revenue service or social security number of the shipper and the tax exemption code (as it appears in the Vessel Operation Report instructions) claimed for the shipment are to be included on the Vessel Operation Report.
(ii)
Fee payment.
The shipper whose name appears on the Vessel Operation Report must pay all accumulated fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at
http://www.pay.gov
or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov.
(2)
Import vessel movements
—(i)
Time and place of liability.
Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, and destined for either consumption,
warehousing, or foreign trade zone admission, the importer of that cargo, or in the case of foreign trade zones, the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone, is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee is based on the CBP appraised value of the shipment pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1401a, the same basis as that used for duty payment. The fee will be collected on all formal entries, including warehouse entries and temporary importation under bond entries, and admissions into foreign trade zones.
(ii)
Fee payment.
The port use fee on unloading of imported cargo must be paid in accordance with the normal CBP collection procedures set forth in §§ 24.1 and 141.1 of this chapter, except as provided for merchandise admitted into foreign trade zones in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. The CBP Entry Summary Form (CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent), is to be completed with the amount of the fee shown and identified on the form. The fee must be paid by the importer by adding it to any normal duty, tax or fee payable at the time of formal entry processing.
If no other duty, tax, or fee is imposed on the shipment, and the fee exceeds $3, a check or money order for the amount of the fee must be attached to the CBP entry forms submitted.
(iii)
Foreign Trade Zones.
In cases where imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section and admitted into a foreign trade zone, the applicant for admission (the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone) who becomes liable for the fee at the time of unloading pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, must pay all fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at
http://www.pay.gov
or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Fees must be paid for all shipments unloaded and admitted to the zone, or in the case of direct deliveries under §§ 146.39 and 146.40 of this chapter, unloaded and received in the zone under the bond of the foreign trade zone operator.
(3)
Passengers
—(i)
Time and place of liability.
Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when a passenger boards or disembarks a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, the operator of that vessel is liable for the payment of the port use fee. The fee is to be based upon the value of the actual charge for transportation paid by the passenger or on the prevailing charge for comparable service if no actual charge is paid. The vessel operator on each cruise is liable only once for the port use fee for each passenger.
(ii)
Fee payment.
The operator of the passenger-carrying vessel must pay the accumulated fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349.

(4)
Refunds and supplemental payments
—(i)
General.
To make supplemental payments or seek refunds of harbor maintenance fees paid relative to the unloading of imported cargo, the procedures applicable to supplemental payments or refunds of ordinary duties must be followed. To seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph
(e)(4)(iv) of this section must be followed. To make supplemental payments on any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to other than export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) must be followed.
(ii)
Time limit for refund requests.
A refund request must be received by CBP within one year of the date the fee for which the refund is sought was paid to CBP or, in the case of fees paid relative to imported merchandise admitted into a foreign trade zone and subsequently withdrawn from the zone under 19 U.S.C. 1309, within one year of the date of withdrawal from the zone.
(iii)
For fees paid on other than export movements.
If a supplemental payment is made for any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or a refund is requested relative to quarterly fee payments previously made regarding the loading or unloading of domestic cargo, the unloading of cargo destined for admission into a foreign trade zone, or the boarding or disembarking of passengers, the refund request or supplemental payment must be accompanied by a Harbor Maintenance Fee Amended Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 350, along with a copy of the Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter(s) covering the payment to which the refund request or supplemental payment relates. A request for a refund must specify the grounds for the refund. Supplemental payments and HMF refund requests, accompanied by the requisite CBP Forms 350 and 349 and, if applicable, supporting documentation, must be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at
http://www.pay.gov
or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. If a supplemental payment is mailed, a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection must be attached to each CBP Form 350. Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.
(iv)
For fees paid on export movements.
CBP will process refund requests relative to fee payments previously made regarding the loading of cargo for export as follows:
(A)
Refund request.
For export fee payments made prior to July 1, 1990, the exporter (the name that appears on the SED or equivalent documentation authorized under 15 CFR 30.39(b)) or its agent must submit a letter of request for a refund specifying the grounds for the refund and identifying the specific payments made. The letter must be accompanied by the proof of payment set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section. For export fee payments made on or after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required with the refund request. For these payments, the request must specify the grounds for the refund, identify the quarters for which a refund is sought, and contain the following additional information: the exporter's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN); the name and EIN of any freight forwarder or other agent that made export fee payments on the exporter's behalf; and a name, telephone number, and facsimile number of a contact person. Refund requests must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at
http://www.pay.gov
or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Approved HMF refund payments will be made using the ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.
(B)
Refund procedure
—(
1
)
Processing order; power of attorney.
Generally, a properly filed refund request will be processed in the chronological order of its receipt. A refund request filed on behalf of an exporter by an agent other than a freight forwarder must be supported by a power of attorney or letter signed by the exporter authorizing the representation. A refund request filed by an agent other than a freight forwarder that lacks a power of attorney
or authorization letter will not be processed unless one or the other is submitted. A refund request filed by a freight forwarder does not require a power of attorney or authorization letter to be processed; however, if CBP has not received a power of attorney or authorization letter for an exporter covered in a freight forwarder's refund request and that exporter has filed a separate refund request on its own behalf, that freight forwarder's entire refund request will be removed from the chronological processing order and processed after the processing of all exporter refund requests is completed.
(
2
)
HMT Payment Report and Report/Certification.
In processing a request for a refund, CBP will conduct a search of its records (CBP electronic database and paper document sources) and produce for issuance to the exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) a “Harbor Mantenance Tax Payment Report” (HMT Payment Report) that lists all payments reflected in those records for the entire period the fee was in effect. CBP will also produce for issuance to the exporter a “Harbor Maintenance Tax Refund Report and Certification” (Report/Certification) that lists all payments supported by paper documentation, either retained by CBP (relative to payments made on and after July 1, 1990) or submitted by the exporter with its refund request (relative to payments made at any time the fee was in effect). Where a refund request was filed on the exporter's behalf by an agent other than a freight forwarder, a power of attorney or authorization letter must be filed with CBP before CBP will issue these reports. The Report/Certification sets forth the total amount of the refund that CBP believes it owes the exporter for the payments listed in that report (minus any previous refunds). Pre-July 1, 1990, payments listed in the HMT Payment Report for which paper documentation has not been provided by the exporter will not be listed in the Report/Certification. The exporter has 120 days from the date the HMT Payment Report and the Report/Certification are issued (the 120-day period) to sign and return to CBP the Report/Certification in order to receive the refund set forth in that report and/or to submit to CBP a request for a Revised Report/Certification. Where the exporter chooses to receive the refund set forth in the Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return the report to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon receipt of the signed report.
(
3
)
Revised Report/Certification.
A request for a Revised Report/Certification must be accompanied by documentation to support any payments not listed in the Report/Certification or corrections to listed payments. See paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section regarding acceptable documentation. If an exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) both signs and returns to CBP a Report/Certification and requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will not, when reviewing the request for a Revised Report/Certification, approve for refund any corrections to the payments that were listed in the signed Report/Certification; CBP will, however, in that circumstance, consider approving any additional payments that were not listed in the signed Report/Certification. If an exporter does not sign and return to CBP a Report/Certification, but requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will consider approving for refund corrections to the payments listed in the Report/Certification and additional payments. Where the exporter requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will review the documentation submitted with the request, make a determination, and, within 60 days of the request's receipt, issue a Revised Report/Certification that lists all payments approved for refund and the total amount of the refund owed. In order to receive the refund set forth in a Revised Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return it to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon its receipt of the signed report. An exporter, within the 120-day period, may submit additional requests for a Revised Report/Certification, with appropriate documentation, to cover any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification previously issued by CBP.
(
4
)
Protest.
For purposes of filing a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 (and 19 CFR part 174), unless issuance of a Revised Report/Certification is pending, any payments not approved for refund
in a Report/Certification or a Revised Report/Certification issued by CBP within the 120-day period will be considered denied as of the date the period expires; a protest covering such payments must be filed within 180 days of that date. For any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification issued after expiration of the 120-day period, a protest may be filed within 180 days of that report's issuance.
(
5
)
Significance of signed Report/Certification and Revised Report/Certification.
A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification must be signed by an officer of the company duly authorized to bind the company or by an agent (such as a broker or freight forwarder) representing the exporter in seeking a refund under this section. A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification signed by the exporter or its agent and received by CBP constitutes the exporter's agreement that the amount of the refund set forth in the report is accurate and CBP's payment of that refund amount is in full accord and satisfaction of all payments approved for refund in the report. The signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification also represents the exporter's release, waiver, and abandonment of all claims, excluding claims for interest, against the Government, its officers, agents, and assigns for costs, attorney fees, expenses, compensatory damages, and exemplary damages arising out of the payments approved for refund in the report. When an agent, including a freight forwarder, signs a Report/Certification or Revised Report/ Certification on behalf of an exporter(s), the agent certifies that it is acting on the exporter's behalf and will use due diligence to forward the refund to the exporter, and, in the event the agent does not forward the refund to the exporter, will notify CBP and return the refund to CBP within one year of its receipt of the refund. Upon receipt of the signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification, CBP releases, waives, and abandons all claims other than fraud against the exporter, its officers, agents, or employees arising out of all payments approved for refund in the report.
(C)
Documentation.
For payments made prior to July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is required to obtain a refund and must be submitted in accordance with paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(A) and/or (B)(
3
) of this section. For payments made on and after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required to obtain a refund, unless the exporter seeks to prove corrections of payments listed in the Report/Certification (if the exporter did not sign and return it to CBP) and/or additional payments not listed in a Report/Certification, in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(
3
) of this section. The supporting documentation that CBP will accept as establishing entitlement to a refund, whether submitted with a refund request or a request for a Revised Report/Certification, is whichever of the following documents CBP accepted with the payment at the time it was made: a copy of the Export Vessel Movement Summary Sheet; where an Automated Summary Monthly Shipper's Export Declaration was filed, a copy of a letter containing the exporter's identification, its employer identification number (EIN), the Census Bureau reporting symbol, and, the quarter for which the payment was made; or a copy of a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter covering the refund requested. CBP also will consider other documentation offered as proof of payment of the fee, such as cancelled checks and/or affidavits from exporters attesting to the fact that all quarterly harbor maintenance tax payments made by the exporter were made exclusively for exports, and will accept that other documentation as establishing entitlement for a refund only if it clearly proves the payments were made for export harbor maintenance fees in the amounts sought to be refunded and were made by the party requesting the refund or the party on whose behalf the refund was requested.
(f)
Quarterly payments.
All quarterly payments required by this section must be received no later than 31 days after the close of the quarter being paid. Quarterly periods end on the last day of March, June, September, and December.
(g)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer, applicant for admission of cargo into a foreign trade zone, shipper and cruise vessel operator affected by this section must maintain all such documentation necessary for CBP to verify the accuracy of fee computations and to otherwise determine compliance under the law. Such documentation must be maintained for a period of 5 years from the date of fee calculation. The affected parties must advise the Director, Revenue Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, at the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov, of the name, address, email and telephone number of a responsible officer who is able to verify any records required to be maintained under this paragraph. The Director, Revenue Division, must be promptly notified of any changes in the identifying information submitted. The records must be maintained and made available for inspection, copying, reproduction or other official use by CBP in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter.
(h)
Penalties/liquidated damages for failure to pay harbor maintenance fee and file summary sheet
—(1)
Amount of penalty or damages.
Any party (including the importer, or shipper) who fails to pay the harbor maintenance fee and file the summary sheet at the time specified by regulation will incur a penalty equal to the amount of liquidated damages assessable for late filing of an entry summary pursuant to the provisions of § 142.15 of this chapter. An importer will be liable for payment of liquidated damages under the basic importation and entry bond, for failure to pay the harbor maintenance fee, as provided in such bond.
(2)
Application for relief.
The party must follow the procedures set forth in part 171 of this chapter in filing an application for relief. Any application to cancel liquidated damages incurred must be made in accordance with part 172 of this chapter.
(3)
Mitigation.
Any penalty assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines relating to cancellation of claims for liquidated damages for late filing of entry summaries. Any liquidated damages assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines published by the authority of the Commissioner of CBP for cancellation of claims for untimely payment of estimated duties, taxes and charges.
(i)
Privacy Act notice.
Whenever an identification number is requested on the summary sheets provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the disclosure of the social security number is mandatory when an internal revenue service number is not disclosed. Identification numbers are solicited under the authority of Executive Order 9397 and Pub. L. 99-662. The identification number provides unique identification of the party liable for the payment of the harbor maintenance fee. The number will be used to compare the information on the summary sheets with information submitted to the government on other forms required in the course of shipping or importing merchandise, which contain the identification number,
e.g.,
Vessel Operation Report, to verify that the information submitted is accurate and current. Failure to disclose an identification number may cause a penalty pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. The above information is set forth pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579).

§ 24.25
Statement processing and Automated Clearinghouse.
(a)
Description.
Statement processing is a voluntary automated program for participants in the Automated Broker Interface (ABI), allowing the grouping of entry/entry summaries and entry summaries on a daily basis. The related duties, taxes, fees, and interest may be paid with a single payment. The preferred method of payment is by Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) debit or ACH credit, except where the importer of record has provided a separate check payable to the “U.S. Customs and Border Protection” for customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed CBP (see § 111.29(b) of this
chapter)). A particular statement payment must be accomplished entirely through ACH or completely by check or cash. A mixing of payment methods for a single statement will not be accepted. ACH debit (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is an arrangement in which the filer electronically provides payment authorization for the Treasury-designated ACH processor to perform an electronic debit to the payer's bank account; ACH credit is described in § 24.26. The payment amount will then be automatically credited to the account of the Department of the Treasury. If a filer chooses to use statement processing for entries of quota-class merchandise and other special classes of merchandise designated by CBP Headquarters under § 142.13(b) of this chapter, he must also use statement processing as a normal course of business for the largest possible portion (see § 24.25(d)) of his eligible non-special class entries; further, he must use the ACH payment mechanism to pay all his ABI statements containing entries for quota-class merchandise. In no circumstance will check or cash be acceptable for payment of ABI statements containing entries for quota-class merchandise.
(b)
How to elect participation
—(1)
Statement processing.
An ABI filer must notify CBP in writing of the intention to utilize statement processing.
(2)
Automated Clearinghouse debit.
If an ABI filer pays his statements through ACH debit, rather than by check, he must provide to CBP the bank routing number and the bank account number for each account from which ACH payments are to be electronically debited. Upon the determination by CBP that the ABI filer has the necessary software to participate and otherwise qualifies to participate in ACH, CBP shall assign a unique identifying payer's unit number to the participant and the Treasury-designated ACH processor. This unique number assigned by CBP will alert the ACH processor as to which bank and account to issue the electronic debit. If a client of a ABI filer opts to pay CBP charges from his own account through an ABI filer, the client must provide directly to CBP the bank transit routing number and the bank account number for each of his accounts from which ACH payments can be electronically debited. CBP will then assign a unique payer's unit number to each of his accounts and provide the assigned unit number directly to the client and the Treasury-designated ACH processor. The client would then provide the appropriate payer's unit number to his broker to pay his statements through ABI. It is the responsibility of the participant to ensure that all bank account information is accurate and that the correct unique payer's unit number is utilized for each ACH transaction.
(c)
Procedure for filer.
(1) The filer shall transmit entry/entry summary and entry summary data through ABI indicating whether payment for a particular entry summary will be by individual check or by using statement processing. If statement processing is indicated, the filer shall designate whether the entry summary is to be grouped by importer or broker, and shall provide a valid scheduled statement date (within 10 days of entry, but not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday).
(2) CBP shall provide a preliminary statement to the ABI filer on the scheduled statement date. The preliminary statement shall contain all entry/entry summaries and entry summaries scheduled for that statement date. The preliminary statement shall be printed by the filer, who will review the statement entries and the statement totals, assemble the required entry summaries as listed in the statement, and present them to CBP with the preliminary statement. This presentation must be made within 10 working days after entry of the merchandise. If a filer elects to perform deletions from the preliminary statement (other than items related to special classes of merchandise provided for in § 142.13(b) of this chaper), the filer shall notify CBP in such manner as designated by CBP Headquarters. Any entry number deleted from a statement may be paid by an individual check or scheduled for another statement by transmitting the entry summary data through ABI with a future payment date.
(3) The ABI filer using statement processing is responsible for ensuring that payment is made within 10 days of the entry of the related merchandise.
(4) Payments made through ACH are processed as follows:
(i)
Payment date; interest and liquidated damages.
The date of acceptance of the ACH debit payment authorization or ACH credit payment for the preliminary statement is the payment date when determining compliance with the due date for scheduled statements and for purposes of § 24.3a of this part, and subject to the provisions of § 113.62(a)(1)(i) and (m)(4) of this chapter.
(ii)
Issuance of final statement.
CBP shall, upon confirmation from the Department of the Treasury that funds are available and transferred to CBP, identify the final statement as paid and post the appropriate amounts to the related entries.
(iii)
Evidence of payment.
The final statement generally shall be available to the filer the day following the receipt of the ACH payment by CBP. The final statement may be utilized as evidence that statement payment has occurred through an ACH transaction. In other instances, a cancelled check may serve as evidence of payment.
(d)
Choice of excluding certain entries from statement processing.
An ABI filer using statement processing, generally, has the right to inform CBP electronically whether he desires that a particular entry summary be paid by individual payment or through statement processing. If a filer opts to use statement processing for entry/entry summaries for quota-class and other special classes of merchandise defined in § 142.13(b) of this chapter, he shall use statement processing in the normal course of business for the largest possible portion of his eligible non-special class entries also; further, he shall pay for these entry/entry summaries through ACH. If a filer opts to use statement processing and, therefore, ACH for entry/entry summaries for special classes of merchandise defined in § 142.13(b) of this chapter, these entry/entry summaries cannot be deleted from a statement. A filer who excludes or deletes entries from the statement process and ACH should be prepared to articulate a sound business reason why these exclusions or deletions have occurred. If CBP believes that a broker is using ACH for his quota-class entries and not using statement processing and ACH for the largest possible portion of his eligible non-special class entries, the ABI participant may be consulted by CBP as to why he has not used statement processing and ACH for certain entries. If CBP is not satisfied, after such consultation, that there were sound articulable business reasons for the exclusion or deletion of non-special class entries, CBP may disqualify the participant from using statement processing/ACH for quota-class entries.
(e)
Scheduled statement date.
Entry/entry summaries and entry summaries must be designated for statement processing within 10 working days after the date of entry. It is the responsibility of the ABI filer using statement processing to ensure that the elected scheduled statement date is within that 10-day timeframe. CBP will not warn the filer if the scheduled statement date given is late.

§ 24.26
Automated Clearinghouse credit.
(a)
Description.
Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) credit is an optional payment method that allows a payer to transmit statement processing payments (see § 24.25) or deferred tax payments (see § 24.4) or bill payments (see § 24.3) electronically, through its financial institution, directly to the CBP account maintained by the Department of the Treasury.
(b)
Enrollment procedure.
A payer interested in enrolling in the ACH credit program must indicate such interest by providing the following information to the National Finance Center, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Administration, Revenue Division, 6650 Telecom Drive, Suite 100, Indianapolis, IN 46278: Payer name and address; payer contact name(s); payer telephone number(s) and facsimile number; payer identification number (importer number or Social Security number or CBP assigned number); and 3-digit filer code.
(c)
Routing and format instructions.
Following receipt of the enrollment information, the National Finance Center will provide the payer with specific ACH credit routing and format instructions and will advise the payer that the following information must be provided to its financial institution when originating its payments: Company name; company contact person name and telephone number; company identification number (coded Internal Revenue Service employer identification number or DUNS number or CBP assigned number); company payment description; effective date; receiving company name; transaction code; CBP transit routing number and CBP account number; payment amount; payer identifier (importer number or Social Security number or CBP assigned number or filer code if the payer is a broker who is the importer of record); document number (daily statement number, entry or warehouse withdrawal number for a deferred tax payment, or bill number); payment type code; settlement date; and document payment amount.
(d)
Prenotification procedure.
Before effecting any payments of funds through the ACH credit process, the payer must follow a prenotification procedure, involving a non-funds message transmission through its financial institution to the CBP account, in order to validate the routing instructions. When the routing instructions are validated, the National Finance Center will notify the payer that the prenotification transaction has been accepted and that payments may be originated on or after the tenth calendar day following the prenotification acceptance date.
(e)
Payment origination procedures
—(1)
General.
Once the payer has received authorization to begin originating ACH credit payments under paragraph (d) of this section, the payer, through its financial institution, must originate each payment transaction to the CBP account no later than one business day prior to the payment due date. The payer's account will be charged by the financial institution on the settlement date identified in the transaction. The payer is responsible for following the routing and format instructions provided by CBP and for ensuring the accuracy of the information when originating each payment. Improperly formatted or erroneous information provided by the payer will delay the prompt posting of the payment to the receivable.
(2)
Procedures for daily statement filers.
The procedures set forth in § 24.25(c) for ABI filers using statement processing remain applicable when payment is effected through ACH credit. However, when the ABI filer is a customs broker who is not the importer of record and thus is not responsible for the payment, the ABI filer must provide the statement number and statement amount to the importer of record at least one business day prior to the due date so that the importer of record can originate the payment.
(f)
Date of collection.
The date that the ACH credit payment transaction is received by CBP shall be the collection date which equates to the settlement date. The appropriate daily statement or entry or warehouse withdrawal or bill shall be identified as paid as of that collection date.
(g)
Removal from the ACH credit program.
If a payer repeatedly provides improperly formatted or erroneous information when originating ACH credit payments, the National Finance Center may advise the payer in writing to refrain from using ACH credit and to submit its payments by bank draft or check pursuant to § 24.1 or, in the case of daily statement payments, to use the ACH debit payment method under § 24.25.
[T.D. 98-51, 63 FR 29125, May 28, 1998, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-21, 77 FR 73308, Dec. 10, 2012]
§ 24.32
Claims; unpaid compensation of deceased employees and death benefits.
(a) A claim made by a designated beneficiary or a surviving spouse for unpaid compensation due an officer or employee at the time of his death shall be executed on standard Form 1153, Claim of Designated Beneficiary and/or Surviving Spouse for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Civilian Employee. A claim made by anyone other than a designated beneficiary or surviving spouse for unpaid compensation
due an officer or employee at the time of his death shall be executed on standard Form 1155, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Civilian Employee. The claims shall be forwarded to the Customs office where the deceased was employed.
(b) Claims for death benefits, either in the form of an annuity or lump-sum payment of the amount to the credit of the deceased officer or employee in the Retirement and Disability Fund shall be executed on standard Form 100, Application for Death Benefit, and forwarded together with a certified copy of the public record of death directly to the Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415.
[28 FR 14808, Dec. 31, 1963, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46114, Sept. 10, 1991]
§ 24.34
Vouchers; vendors' bills of sale; invoices.
(a) Vouchers or invoices for transportation and related services which are intended for payment from official funds shall contain the following certification signed by the claimant:
I certify that the above bill is correct and just and that payment has not been received.
Vouchers, vendors' bills of sale, or invoices for purchases or services other than personal do not require the foregoing certification.
(b) Every voucher shall be in the name of the person or persons furnishing the service or supplies, except in the case of a service or supplies paid for in an emergency by a Customs officer or employee, in which case the voucher may be in the name of the officer or employee who made the payment.
(c) The signature of a claimant made by a mark shall be attested in each case by a disinterested witness.
(d) The dates appearing on vouchers and on receipts filed in support thereof shall always be the actual dates of the transactions recorded or action taken thereon. As many copies in memorandum form, duly authenticated if desired, may be prepared as administrative or other requirements demand.
(e) When an erasure, interlineation, or change of any kind is made in a voucher after it has been certified by the claimant, such correction or change shall be initialed and dated by the claimant.
(f)(1) Vouchers for passenger transportation furnished Customs officers or employees on Government transportation requests, standard Form 1169, and vouchers for transportation of freight and express furnished on Government bills of lading, standard Form 1103, issued by Customs officers or employees shall be rendered on Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, standard Form 1171 or 1113, respectively, to the Customs office to be billed as indicated on the transportation request or bill of lading.
(2) Charges for freight or express must not be included on the same vouchers with charges for passenger transportation. The words “Passenger,” “Freight,” or “Express,” as the case may be, should be printed or otherwise placed by the carrier immediately above the title of the voucher form. Original Government bills of lading, standard Form 1103, or transportation requests, standard Form 1169, or certificates in lieu thereof, standard Forms 1108 or 1172, respectively, shall be attached to these vouchers.
§ 24.36
Refunds of excessive duties, taxes, etc.
(a) When it is found upon, or prior to, liquidation or reliquidation of an entry or reconciliation that a refund of excessive duties, taxes, fees or interest (at the rate determined in accordance with § 24.3a(c)(1)) is due, a refund shall be prepared in the name of the person to whom the refund is due, as determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If an authority to mail checks to someone other than the payee, Customs Form 4811, is on file, the address of the payee shall be shown as in care of the address of the authorized persons. If a power of attorney is on file, the address of the payee may be shown as in care of the address of such attorney, if requested. A Form 4811 received by Customs will not be effective if a Customs transaction requiring the use of the owner's importer number has not been made within 3 years from the date the Form 4811 was filed or if there is no unliquidated entry on file to which such number is to be associated. For purposes of this section:
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the refund shall include interest on the excess moneys deposited with Customs, and such interest shall accrue from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited or, in a case in which a proper claim is filed under 19 U.S.C. 1520(d), from the date such claim is filed, to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:

# Example:
Entry liquidates for a refund
ER20OC99.005
Importer is owed a refund of $600 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit (January 1) and the entry liquidates for $400 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be owed a refund of $600 plus interest. The interest will accrue from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(i) If an additional deposit of duties, taxes, fees or interest was made prior to liquidation or reliquidation and if any portion of that additional deposit was in excess of the amount required to be deposited, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (a)(1), the refund also shall include interest accrued on the excess additional deposit from the date of the additional deposit to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:

# Example:
Additional deposit made and entry liquidates for a refund
ER20OC99.006
Importer is owed a refund of $900 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit (January 1) and an additional pre-liquidation deposit of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $300 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be refunded $900 plus interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) On the additional deposit overpayment ($200), from the date of the additional deposit (May 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1); and (2) on the initial deposit overpayment ($700), from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(ii) In the case of a refund of duties, taxes, fees or interest made prior to liquidation, such a refund will include only principal amounts and not any interest thereon. Interest on such principal amounts will be computed at the time of liquidation or reliquidation and shall accrue as follows:
(A) Interest shall only accrue on the amount refunded from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited to the date of the refund if the amount refunded is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute the true excess amount deposited with Customs. An example follows:

# Example:
Pre-liquidation refund and entry liquidates for net amount collected
ER20OC99.007
Importer is owed a refund of interest on $200 as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit (January 1) and receives a pre-liquidation refund of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $800 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be refunded interest on the $200 overpayment from the date of the initial deposit (January 1) to the date of the pre-liquidation refund (May 1).
(B) If the amount refunded is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute less than the true excess amount deposited with Customs, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (a)(1), interest also shall accrue on the remaining excess deposit from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited to the date of liquidation or reliquidation. An example follows:

# Example:
Pre-liquidation refund and entry liquidates for an additional refund
ER20OC99.008
Importer is owed a refund of $700 plus interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit (January 1) and receives a pre-liquidation refund of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $100 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be refunded $700 plus interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) On the pre-liquidation refund ($200), from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of the pre-liquidation refund (May 1); and (2) on the remaining overpayment ($700), from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(C) If an entry or reconciliation is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation to involve both an initial underpayment and an additional excess deposit, interest in each case shall be computed separately and the resulting amounts shall be netted for purposes of determining the final amount of interest to be reflected in the refund. An example follows:

# Example:
Additional deposit made and entry liquidates for a refund
ER20OC99.009
Importer is owed a refund of $200 plus or minus net interest as follows:
The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and an additional pre-liquidation deposit of $300 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,100 (December 1). Upon liquidation, the importer will be refunded $200 plus or minus net interest. The interest accrues in two segments: (1) Interest accrues in favor of the Government on the initial underpayment ($100) from the date deposit was required (January 1) to the date of the additional deposit (May 1); and (2) interest accrues in favor of the importer on the
overpayment ($200) from the date of the additional deposit (May 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).
(D) If the amount refunded or any portion thereof exceeds the amount properly refundable as determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reliquidation, the excess amount refunded shall be treated as an underpayment of duties, taxes, fees or interest on which interest shall accrue as provided in § 24.3a.
(2) A refund determined to be due upon liquidation or reliquidation, including a refund consisting only of interest that has accrued in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, shall be paid within 30 days of the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation.
(3) If a refund, including any interest thereon, is not paid in full within the applicable 30-day period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the refund shall be considered delinquent thereafter and interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance by 30-day periods until the full balance is paid. However, no interest will accrue during the 30-day period in which the refund is paid.
(b) Refunds of excessive duties, taxes, fees or interest shall be certified for payment to the importer of record unless a transferee of the right to withdraw merchandise from bonded warehouse is entitled to receive the refund under section 557(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, or an owner's declaration has been filed in accordance with section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, or a surety submits evidence of payment to Customs, upon default of the principal, of amounts previously determined to be due on the same entry or transaction. The certification of a refund for payment to a nominal consignee may be made prior to the expiration of the 90-day period within which an owner's declaration may be filed as prescribed in section 485(d) of the Tariff Act, provided the nominal consignee waives in writing his right to file such declaration. If an owner's declaration has been duly filed, the refund shall be certified for payment to the actual owner who executed the declaration, except that, irrespective of whether an owner's declaration has been filed, refunds shall be certified for payment to a transferee provided for in section 557(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, if the moneys with respect to which the refund was allowed were paid by such transferee. If a surety submits evidence of payment to Customs, upon default of the principal, for an amount previously determined to be due on an entry or transaction the refund shall be certified to that surety up to the amount paid by it or shall be applied to other obligations of the surety.
(c) If the nominal consignee has become bankrupt, refunds of duties, taxes, fees or interest on merchandise entered in the name of such nominal consignee for the account of the actual owner shall be withheld from payment pending the receipt of a claim therefor and the establishment of rights thereto, unless the declaration of the actual owner has been filed with the port director under section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930.
(d) The authority of CBP to make refunds pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section of excessive deposits of alcohol or tobacco taxes, as defined in section 6423(d)(1), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 6423(d)(1)), is confined to cases of the types which are excepted from the application of section 6423, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 6423), and which are not administered by the Department of the Treasury under section 107(e) of Public Law 116-260, div. EE, title I (December 27, 2020). The excepted types of cases and, therefore, the types in which CBP is authorized to make refunds of such taxes are those in which:
(1) The tax was paid or collected on an article imported for the personal or household use of the importer;
(2) The refund is made pursuant to provisions of laws and regulations for drawback;
(3) The tax was paid or collected on an imported article withdrawn from the market, returned to bond, or lost or destroyed, when any law expressly provides for refund in such case;
(4) The tax was paid or collected on an imported article which has been lost, where a suit or proceeding was instituted before June 15, 1957;
(5) The refund of tax is pursuant to a claim based solely on errors of computation of the quantity of the imported article, or on mathematical errors in computation of the tax due;
(6) The tax was paid or collected on an imported article seized and forfeited, or destroyed, as contraband;
(7) The tax was paid or collected on an imported article refused admission to Customs territory and exported or destroyed in accordance with section 558, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended;
(8) The refund of tax is pursuant to a reliquidation of an entry under section 520(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and does not involve a rate of tax applicable to an imported article;
(9) The tax was paid or collected on a greater quantity of imported articles than that actually imported and the fact of the deficiency is established to the port directors' satisfaction before liquidation of the entry becomes final; or
(10) For alcohol excise taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or before December 31, 2022, the refund of tax is claimed pursuant to the assignment of a reduced tax rate or tax credit to an importer by a foreign producer in accordance with CBP implementation of sections 13801-13808 of Public Law 115-97 (December 22, 2017), as amended. For goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after December 31, 2022, see the procedures provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(e) In any instance in which a refund of an alcohol or tobacco tax is not of a type covered by paragraph (d) of this section the following procedures will apply:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2), a claim for refund of any overpayment of internal revenue tax on an entry must be filed with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), in accordance with TTB regulations found in Part 70 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(2) A claim for refund of alcohol excise taxes based on the assignment of a reduced tax rate or tax credit to an importer by a foreign good producer for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after January 1, 2023, and submitted pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5001(c)(4), 5041(c)(7), and 5051(a)(6), must be filed with TTB, in accordance with TTB regulations found in part 27, subpart P, of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 24.70
Claims; deceased or incompetent public creditors.
(a) Claims for amounts due individual deceased public creditors of the United States (except civilian officers and employees subject to the provisions of section 61f-61k, Title 5, United States Code), should be made on standard Form No. 1055—Revised. Such claims include claims for payments due deceased contractors for articles furnished or services performed, and claims for payments due deceased importers or owners of merchandise on account of refunds of excessive duties, or taxes, or for payment of drawback, etc. Claims for payment of Government checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States or other authorized Government depositary to the order of such public creditors, which cannot be paid because of the death of the payee, should be stated on standard Form 1055—Revised. Information should be furnished regarding the disposition of these checks in case they are not in possession of the claimant, otherwise they should accompany the claim.
(b) No form is prescribed for use of a guardian or committee of an estate of an incompetent in making claim for sums due from the United States. Such guardian or committee may submit in letter form, over his address and signature, an application for amounts due an estate of an incompetent, setting forth the incompetent's connection with the United States Customs Service. This application should be supported by a short certificate of the court showing the appointment and qualification of the claimant as guardian or committee. In case the total amount due the estate of the incompetent is small, and no guardian or
committee of the estate has been or will be appointed, the application may be submitted by the person or persons having care or custody of the incompetent, or by close relatives who will hold any amount found due for the use and benefit of the incompetent. Applications for recurring payments need not be accompanied by an additional certificate of the court, but should be supported by a statement that the appointment is still in full force and effect. All Government checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States or other authorized Government depository to the order of individuals which cannot be paid because of incompetency of the payee should accompany the claim, otherwise an explanation should be given as to the disposition of the check.
(c) Claims for payments due deceased or incompetent contractors should be submitted to the Customs field officer at whose order the articles were furnished or services performed. Claims for refunds of excessive duties, or taxes, or for payment of drawback and other similar claims due deceased or incompetent public creditors shall be submitted to the port director. The Customs field officer may grant necessary assistance to claimants to insure proper execution of standard Form 1055—Revised in the case of deceased public creditors, and in the case of incompetent public creditors to insure submission of the application in proper form. The port director shall settle the claim unless there is a doubtful question of fact or law, in which case the claim shall be forwarded to the Accounting Services Division, Accounts Receivable Group, Indianapolis, Indiana, with originals or certified copies of any necessary documents and with an appropriate report and recommendation.

Claims; set-off.
When an importer of record or other party has a judgment or other claim allowed by legal authority against the United States, and he is indebted to the United States, either as principal or surety, for an amount which is legally fixed and undisputed, the port director shall set off so much of the judgment or other claim as will equal the amount of the debt due the Government.

# Metal Articles Imported to be Used in Remanufacture by Melting, or to be Processed by Shredding, Shearing, Compacting, or Similar Processing Which Renders Them Fit Only for the Recovery of the Metal Content
§ 54.5
Scope of exemptions; nondeposit of estimated duty.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, articles predominating by weight of metal to be used in remanufacture by melting, or to be processed by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing which renders them fit only for the recovery of the metal content, and actually so used, shall be entitled to free entry upon compliance with § 54.6, if entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the effective period of subheadings 9817.00.80 and 9817.00.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). This provision does not apply to:
(1) Articles of lead, zinc, or tungsten;
(2) Metal-bearing materials provided for in section VI, Chapter 26 or subheading 8548.10, HTSUS; or
(3) Unwrought metal provided for in Section XV, HTSUS.”
(b) No deposit of estimated duty shall be required upon the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of the articles described in paragraph (a) of this section if the Center director is satisfied at the time of entry, or withdrawal, by written declaration of the importer, or its electronic equivalent, that the merchandise is being imported to be used in remanufacture by melting, or to be processed by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing which renders it fit only for the recovery of the metal content.
[T.D. 80-151, 45 FR 38041, June 6, 1980, as amended by T.D. 87-75, 52 FR 20067, May 29, 1987; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51254, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 98-4, 62 FR 68165, Dec. 31, 1997; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61286, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. 16-26, 81 FR 93016, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 54.6
Proof of intent; bond; proof of use; liquidation.
Articles predominating by weight of metal, described in § 54.5(a) shall be admitted free of duty upon compliance with the following conditions:
(a) There shall be filed in connection with the entry a statement of the importer, or its electronic equivalent, consistent with the requirements of § 10.134 of this chapter.
(b) If the articles are entered for consumption or warehouse, a bond shall be filed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. Withdrawals from warehouse shall be made on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent. The liquidation of the consumption or warehouse entry shall be suspended pending proof of use or other disposition of the articles within the time prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Within 3 years from the date of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, the importer shall submit to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically, a statement from the superintendent or manager of the plant at which the articles were used in remanufacture by melting, or were processed by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing which rendered them fit only for the recovery of the metal content, showing:
(1) The name and location of the plant;
(2) The entry number, date, and port of entry (if the person making the statement is not in possession of this information, a reference to invoices, purchase orders, or other documents which will identify the shipment with the entry may be substituted);
(3) The date or inclusive dates of the remanufacture or processing of the articles; and
(4) A description of the remanufacture or processing in sufficient detail to enable the Center director to determine whether it constituted a use in remanufacture by melting, or processing by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing which rendered the articles fit only for the recovery of the metal content. In appropriate cases, the remanufacture or processing of the articles covered by more than one entry may be included in one statement. The statement shall be based on adequate and carefully kept plant and import records which
shall be available during normal business hours to any Customs officer. The importer and plant manager shall maintain the import and plant records for 5 years from the date of the related entry of the merchandise. The burden shall be on the importer or plant manager to keep these records so that the claim of actual use can be established readily.
(d) If satisfactory proof of use of the articles in remanufacture by melting, or in processing by shredding, shearing, compacting, or similar processing which rendered them fit only for the recovery of the metal content, is furnished within the prescribed time, the entry shall be liquidated without the assessment of duty on the covered articles. If proof is not filed within 3 years from the date of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, or the use does not warrant the classification claimed, the entry shall be liquidated without any exemption from duty under subheading 9817.00.80 or 9817.00.90, HTSUS.
As used in this section, the phrase “in connection with the entry” means any time before liquidation of the entry or within the period during which a reliquidation may be completed (§ 113.43(c)). Therefore, a claim for free entry under subheading 9817.00.80 or 9817.00.90, HTSUS, supported by a statement of intent may be filed at any time before liquidation of the entry or within the period during which a valid reliquidation may be completed.

§ 101.1
Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated unless either the context in which they are used requires a different meaning or a different definition is prescribed for a particular part or portion thereof:

Industry sectors are categorized by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) numbers representing an industry sector. The list of HTSUS numbers will be published in a
Federal Register
document and any change made to that list will be announced in a subsequent
Federal Register
document.

Customs territory of the United States.
“Customs territory of the United States” includes only the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

The terms “port” and “port of entry” incorporate the geographical area under the jurisdiction of a port director. (The customs ports in the Virgin Islands, although under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, have their own customs laws (48 U.S.C. 1406(i)). These ports, therefore, are outside the customs territory of the United States and the ports thereof are not “ports of entry” within the meaning of these regulations).

(1)
Defined purpose.
The test is limited in scope, time, and application to such relief as may be necessary to facilitate the conduct of a specified program or procedure;
(2)
Prior publication requirement.
Whenever a particular test allows for deviation from any regulatory requirements, notice will be published in the
Federal Register
not less than thirty days prior to implementing such test, followed by publication in the Customs Bulletin.

In addition to the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the imposition of any such different requirements will be subject to the following conditions:
(1)
Prior publication requirement.
For tests affecting the NCAP, notice will be published in the
Federal Register
not less than thirty days prior to implementing such test, followed by publication in the Customs Bulletin.

The list of HTSUS numbers that will be used by CBP for the importer's placement in a Center is the same list of HTSUS numbers that are referenced in the definition for Centers (see § 101.1). Factors that may cause CBP to place an importer in a Center not based on the tariff classification of the predominant number of goods imported include the importer's associated business practices within an industry, the intended use of the predominant number of goods imported, or the high relative value of goods imported.
(c)
Appeal of Center assignment.
An importer may appeal the Center assignment at any time by submitting a written appeal, with a subject line identifier reading “Appeal Regarding Center Assignment”, to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations, Executive Director, Cargo and Conveyance Security (CCS), 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Suite 2.3D, Washington, DC 20229-1015 or by email to
CEE@cbp.dhs.gov
. Appeals must include the following information:
(1) Current Center assignment;
(2) Preferred Center assignment;
(3) All affected Importer of Record (IOR) numbers and associated bond numbers;
(4) Written justification for the change in Center assignments; and
(5) Import data:
(i)
For new importers.
Projected importations at the four (4) digit HTSUS heading level during the current year; or
(ii)
For importers with less than one year of prior import history.
Projected importations and prior import data with entry summary lines and value at the four (4) digit HTSUS heading level; or
(iii)
For importers with more than one year of prior import history.
One year of prior import data with entry summary lines and value at the four (4) digit HTSUS heading level.

§ 102.0
Scope.
With the exception of §§ 102.21 through 102.25, this part sets forth rules for determining the country of origin of imported goods for the purposes specified in paragraph 1 of Annex 311 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). Under NAFTA, these specific purposes are: country of origin marking; determining the rate of duty and staging category applicable to originating textile and apparel products as set out in Section 2 (Tariff Elimination) of Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods); and determining the rate of duty and staging category applicable to an originating good as set out in Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination). The rules set forth in §§ 102.1 through 102.18 and 102.20 also determine the country of origin for marking purposes of imported goods under the Agreement Between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA). The rules set forth in §§ 102.1 through 102.21 of this part will also apply for purposes of determining whether an imported good is a new or different article of commerce under § 10.769 of the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement regulations and § 10.809 of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement regulations. The rules for determining the country of origin of textile and apparel products set forth in § 102.21 apply for the foregoing purposes and for the other purposes stated in that section. Section 102.22 sets forth rules for determining whether textile and apparel products are considered products of Israel for purposes of the customs laws and the administration of quantitative limitations. Sections 102.23 through 102.25 set forth certain procedural requirements relating to the importation of textile and apparel products.

# Subpart B—Rules of Origin
§ 102.11
General rules.
The following rules shall apply for purposes of determining the country of origin of imported goods other than textile and apparel products covered by § 102.21.
(a) The country of origin of a good is the country in which:
(1) The good is wholly obtained or produced;
(2) The good is produced exclusively from domestic materials; or
(3) Each foreign material incorporated in that good undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification set out in § 102.20 and satisfies any other applicable requirements of that section, and all other applicable requirements of these rules are satisfied.
(b) Except for a good that is specifically described in the Harmonized System as a set, or is classified as a set pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 3, where the country of origin cannot be determined under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) The country of origin of the good is the country or countries of origin of the single material that imparts the essential character to the good, or
(2) If the material that imparts the essential character to the good is fungible, has been commingled, and direct physical identification of the origin of the commingled material is not practical, the country or countries of origin may be determined on the basis of an inventory management method.
(c) Where the country of origin cannot be determined under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and the good is specifically described in the Harmonized System as a set or mixture, or classified as a set, mixture or composite good pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 3, the country of origin of the good is the country or countries of origin of all materials that merit equal consideration for determining the essential character of the good.
(d) Where the country of origin of a good cannot be determined under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, the country of origin of the good shall be determined as follows:
(1) If the good was produced only as a result of minor processing, the country of origin of the good is the country or countries of origin of each material that merits equal consideration for determining the essential character of the good;
(2) If the good was produced by simple assembly and the assembled parts that merit equal consideration for determining the essential character of the good are from the same country, the country of origin of the good is the country of origin of those parts; or
(3) If the country of origin of the good cannot be determined under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the country of origin of the good is the last country in which the good underwent production.
[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28956, June 6, 1996, as amended by CBP Dec. 21-10, 86 FR 35581, July 6, 2021]
§ 102.12
Fungible goods.
When fungible goods of different countries of origin are commingled the country of origin of the goods:
(a) Is the countries of origin of those commingled goods; or
(b) If the good is fungible, has been commingled, and direct physical identification of the origin of the commingled good is not practical, the country or countries of origin may be determined on the basis of an inventory management method.
[T.D. 94-4, 59 FR 113, Jan. 3, 1994, as amended by CBP Dec. 21-10, 86 FR 35581, July 6, 2021]
§ 102.13
De Minimis.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, foreign materials that do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in § 102.20 or satisfy the other applicable requirements of that section when incorporated into a good shall be disregarded in determining the country of origin of the good if the value of those materials is no more than 7 percent of the value of the good or 10 percent of the value of a good of Chapter 22, Harmonized System.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a foreign material incorporated in a good provided for in Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17, or 20 of the Harmonized System.
(c) Foreign components or materials that do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in § 102.21 or satisfy the other applicable requirements of that section when incorporated into a textile or apparel product covered by that section shall be disregarded in determining the country of origin of the good if the total weight of those components or materials is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of the good.
[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28956, June 6, 1996]
§ 102.15

[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28956, June 6, 1996]
§ 102.17
Non-qualifying operations.
A foreign material shall not be considered to have undergone an applicable change in tariff classification specified in § 102.20 or § 102.21 or to have met any other applicable requirements of those sections merely by reason of one or more of the following:
(a) A change in end-use;
(b) Dismantling or disassembly;
(c) Simple packing, repacking or retail packaging without more than minor processing;
(d) Mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the material; or
(e) Collecting parts that, as collected, are classifiable in the same tariff provision as an assembled good pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a), without any additional operation other than minor processing.
[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28956, June 6, 1996]
§ 102.18
Rules of interpretation.
(a) When General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 2(a) is referred to in § 102.20 as an exception to an allowed change in tariff classification, this means that such change will not be acceptable for purposes of that section if the change results from the assembly of parts into an incomplete or unfinished good which is classifiable in the same manner as a complete or finished good pursuant to GRI 2(a).
(b) (1) For purposes of identifying the material that imparts the essential character to a good under § 102.11, the only materials that shall be taken into consideration are those domestic or foreign materials that are classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the § 102.20 specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1):
(i) The materials to be considered must be classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good under consideration. For example, in the case of a good classified in HTSUS subheading 8607.11 (the rule for which specifies a change to subheading 8607.11 from any other subheading, except from subheading 8607.12, and except from subheading 8607.19 when that change is pursuant to GRI 2(a)), the only materials that may be considered for purposes of identifying the materials that impart the essential character to the good are those that are classified in subheadings 8607.11, 8607.12 and, if the tariff shift is pursuant to GRI 2(a), 8607.19;
(ii) Materials that may be considered include materials produced by the producer of the good and incorporated in the good. For example, if a producer of a good purchases raw materials and converts those raw materials into a component that is incorporated in the good, that component is a material that may be considered for purposes of identifying the materials that impart the essential character to the good, provided that the component is classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good; and
(iii) If there is only one material that is classified in a tariff provision from which a change in tariff classification is not allowed under the § 102.20 specific rule or other requirements applicable to the good, then that material will represent the single material that imparts the essential character to the good under § 102.11.
(2) For purposes of determining which one of two or more materials described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section imparts the essential character to a good under § 102.11, various factors may be examined depending upon the type of good involved. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) The nature of each material, such as its bulk, quantity, weight or value; and
(ii) The role of each material in relation to the use of the good.
[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28957, June 6, 1996]
§ 102.19
NAFTA preference override.
(a) Except in the case of goods covered by paragraph (b) of this section, if a good which is originating within the meaning of § 181.1(q) of this chapter is not determined under § 102.11(a) or (b) or § 102.21 to be a good of a single NAFTA country, the country of origin of such good is the last NAFTA country in which that good underwent production other than minor processing, provided that a Certificate of Origin (see § 181.11 of this chapter) has been completed and signed for the good.
(b) If, under any other provision of this part, the country of origin of a good which is originating within the meaning of § 181.1(q) of this chapter is determined to be the United States and that good has been exported from, and returned to, the United States after having been advanced in value or improved in condition in another NAFTA country, the country of origin of such good for Customs duty purposes is the last NAFTA country in which that good was advanced in value or improved in condition before its return to the United States.
(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply only to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, prior to July 1, 2020.
[T.D. 96-48, 61 FR 28957, June 6, 1996, as amended by CBP Dec. 21-10, 86 FR 35582, July 6, 2021]
§ 102.20
Specific rules by tariff classification.
The following rules are the rules specified in § 102.11(a)(3) and other sections of this part. Where a rule under this section permits a change to a subheading from another subheading of the same heading, the rule will be satisfied only if the change is from a subheading of the same level specified in the rule.

2. Separation prohibition—
A foreign material/component will not be deemed to have satisfied all applicable requirements of these rules by reason of a change from one classification to another merely as the result of the separation of one or more individual materials or components from a man-made mixture unless the isolated material/component, itself, also underwent a chemical reaction.

§ 102.21
Textile and apparel products.
(a)
Applicability.
Except for purposes of determining whether goods originate in Israel or are the growth, product, or manufacture of Israel, and except as otherwise provided for by statute, the provisions of this section will control the determination of the country of origin of imported textile and apparel products for purposes of the Customs laws and the administration of quantitative restrictions. The provisions of this section will apply to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996.
(b)
Definitions.
The following terms will have the meanings indicated when used in this section:
(1)
Country of origin.
The term country of origin means the country, territory, or insular possession in which a good originates or of which a good is the growth, product, or manufacture.
(2)
Fabric-making process.
A
fabric-making process
is any manufacturing operation that begins with polymers, fibers, filaments (including strips), yarns, twine, cordage, rope, or fabric strips and results in a textile fabric.
(3)
Knit to shape.
The term
knit to shape
applies to any good of which 50 percent or more of the exterior surface area is formed by major parts that have been knitted or crocheted directly to the shape used in the good, with no consideration being given to patch pockets, appliques, or the like. Minor cutting, trimming, or sewing of those major parts will not affect the determination of whether a good is “knit to shape.”
(4)
Major parts.
The term
major parts
means integral components of a good but does not include collars, cuffs, waistbands, plackets, pockets, linings,
paddings, trim, accessories, or similar parts.

The term “wholly assembled” when used with reference to a good means that all components, of which there must be at least two, preexisted in essentially the same condition as found in the finished good and were combined to form the finished good in a single country, territory, or insular possession. Minor attachments and minor embellishments (for example, appliques, beads, spangles, embroidery, buttons) not appreciably affecting the identity of the good, and minor subassemblies (for example, collars, cuffs, plackets, pockets), will not affect the status of a good as “wholly assembled” in a single country, territory, or insular possession.

2. By CBP Dec. 22-25, 87 FR 68356, Nov. 15, 2022, § 102.21 was amended; however, the revision to entry “6201-6208” in table 1 to paragraph (e)(1) could not be incorporated due to inaccurate amendatory instruction.
§ 102.22
Rules of origin for textile and apparel products of Israel.
(a)
Applicability.
The provisions of this section will control for purposes of determining whether a textile or apparel product, as defined in § 102.21(b)(5), is considered a product of Israel for purposes of the customs laws and the administration of quantitative limitations. A textile or apparel product will be a product of Israel if it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Israel. However, a textile or apparel product that consists of materials produced or derived from, or processed in, another country, or insular possession of the United States, in addition to Israel, will be a product of Israel if it last underwent a substantial transformation in Israel. A textile or apparel product will be considered to have undergone a substantial transformation if it has been transformed by means of substantial manufacturing or processing operations into a new and different article of commerce.
(b)
Criteria for determining country of origin for products of Israel.
The criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section will be considered in determining whether an imported textile or apparel product is a product of Israel. These criteria are not exhaustive. One or any combination of criteria may be
determinative, and additional factors may be considered.
(1) A new and different article of commerce will usually result from a manufacturing or processing operation if there is a change in:
(i) Commercial designation or identity;
(ii) Fundamental character; or
(iii) Commercial use.
(2) In determining whether merchandise has been subjected to substantial manufacturing or processing operations, the following will be considered:
(i) The physical change in the material or article as a result of the manufacturing or processing operations in Israel or in Israel and a foreign territory or country or insular possession of the U.S.;
(ii) The time involved in the manufacturing or processing operations in Israel or in Israel and a foreign territory or country or insular possession of the U.S.;
(iii) The complexity of the manufacturing or processing operations in Israel or in Israel and a foreign territory or country or insular possession of the U.S.;
(iv) The level or degree of skill and/or technology required in the manufacturing or processing operations in Israel or in Israel and a foreign territory or country or insular possession of the U.S.; and
(v) The value added to the article or material in Israel or in Israel and a foreign territory or country or insular possession of the U.S., compared to its value when imported into the U.S.
(c)
Manufacturing or processing operations.
(1) An article or material usually will be a product of Israel when it has undergone in Israel prior to importation into the United States any of the following:
(i) Dyeing of fabric and printing when accompanied by two or more of the following finishing operations: bleaching, shrinking, fulling, napping, decating, permanent stiffening, weighting, permanent embossing, or moireing;
(ii) Spinning fibers into yarn;
(iii) Weaving, knitting or otherwise forming fabric;
(iv) Cutting of fabric into parts and the assembly of those parts into the completed article; or
(v) Substantial assembly by sewing and/or tailoring of all cut pieces of apparel articles which have been cut from fabric in another foreign territory or country, or insular possession of the U.S., into a completed garment (e.g., the complete assembly and tailoring of all cut pieces of suit-type jackets, suits, and shirts).
(2) An article or material usually will not be considered to be a product of Israel by virtue of merely having undergone any of the following:
(i) Simple combining operations, labeling, pressing, cleaning or dry cleaning, or packaging operations, or any combination thereof;
(ii) Cutting to length or width and hemming or overlocking fabrics which are readily identifiable as being intended for a particular commercial use;
(iii) Trimming and/or joining together by sewing, looping, linking, or other means of attaching otherwise completed knit-to-shape component parts produced in a single country, even when accompanied by other processes (e.g., washing, drying, and mending) normally incident to the assembly process;
(iv) One or more finishing operations on yarns, fabrics, or other textile articles, such as showerproofing, superwashing, bleaching, decating, fulling, shrinking, mercerizing, or similar operations; or
(v) Dyeing and/or printing of fabrics or yarns.
(d)
Results of origin determination.
If Israel is determined to be the country of origin of a textile or apparel product by application of the provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the inquiry into the origin of the product ends. However, if Israel is determined not to be the country of origin of a textile or apparel product by application of the provisions in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the country of origin of the product will be determined under the rules of origin set forth in § 102.21, although the application of those rules cannot result in Israel being the country of origin of the product.

§ 102.23
Origin and Manufacturer Identification.
(a)
Textile or apparel product manufacturer identification.
All commercial importations of textile or apparel products must identify on CBP Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, (Entry/Immediate Delivery) and CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, (Entry Summary), and in all electronic data transmissions that require identification of the manufacturer, the manufacturer of such products through a manufacturer identification code (MID) constructed from the name and address of the entity performing the origin-conferring operations pursuant to § 102.21 or § 102.22 of this part, as applicable. The code must be accurately constructed using the methodology set forth in the appendix to this part, including the use of the two-letter International Organization for Standardization (ISO) code for the country of origin of such products. When a single entry is filed for products of more than one manufacturer, the products of each manufacturer must be separately identified. Importers must be able to demonstrate to CBP their use of reasonable care in determining the manufacturer. If an entry filed for such merchandise fails to include the MID properly constructed from the name and address of the manufacturer, the Center director may reject the entry or take other appropriate action. For purposes of this paragraph, “textile or apparel products” means goods classifiable in Section XI, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and goods classifiable in any 10-digit HTSUS number outside of Section XI with a three-digit textile category number assigned to the specific subheading.
(b)
Incomplete or insufficient information.
If the Center director is unable to determine the country of origin of a textile or apparel product, the importer must submit additional information as requested by the Center director. Release of the product from CBP custody will be denied until a determination of the country of origin is made based upon the information provided or the best information available.
(c)
Date of exportation.
For quota, visa or export license requirements, and statistical purposes, the date of exportation for textile or apparel products listed in § 102.21(b)(5) will be the date the vessel or carrier leaves the last port in the country of origin, as determined by application of § 102.21 or § 102.22, as applicable. Contingency of diversion in another foreign territory or country will not change the date of exportation for quota, visa or export license requirements or for statistical purposes.

§ 102.24
Entry of textile or apparel products.
Textile or apparel products subject to section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), whether or not the requirements set forth in § 102.21 or § 102.22, as applicable, have been met, will be denied entry where the factory, producer, manufacturer, or other company named in the entry documents for such textile or apparel products is named in a directive published in the
Federal Register
by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements as a company found to be illegally transshipping, closed or unable to produce records to verify production. In these circumstances, no additional information will be accepted or considered by CBP for purposes of determining the admissibility of such textile or apparel products.

§ 102.25
Textile or apparel products under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In connection with a claim for NAFTA preferential tariff treatment involving non-originating textile or apparel products subject to the tariff preference level provisions of appendix 6.B to Annex 300-B of the NAFTA and Additional U.S. Notes 3 through 6 to Section XI, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, the importer must submit to CBP a Certificate of Eligibility, or its electronic equivalent,
covering the products. The Certificate of Eligibility, or its electronic equivalent, must be properly completed and signed by an authorized official of the Canadian or Mexican government and must be presented to CBP at the time the claim for preferential tariff treatment is filed under § 181.21 of this chapter. If the Center director is unable to determine the country of origin of the products, they will not be entitled to preferential tariff treatment or any other benefit under the NAFTA for which they would otherwise be eligible.

Pt. 102, App.

# Appendix to Part 102—Textile and Apparel Manufacturer Identification

# Rules for Constructing the Manufacturer Identification Code (MID)
1. Pursuant to § 102.23(a) of this part, all commercial importations of textile or apparel products, as defined in that paragraph, must identify on CBP Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, (Entry/Immediate Delivery) and CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, (Entry Summary), and in all electronic data transmissions that require identification of the manufacturer, the manufacturer of such products through a manufacturer identification code (MID) constructed from the name and address of the entity performing the origin-conferring operations. The MID may be up to 15 characters in length, with no spaces inserted between the characters.
2. The first 2 characters of the MID consist of the ISO code for the actual country of origin of the goods. The one exception to this rule is Canada. “CA” is not a valid country code for the MID; instead, one of the appropriate province codes listed below must be used:
ALBERTA—XA
BRITISH COLUMBIA—XC
MANITOBA—XM
NEW BRUNSWICK—XB
NEWFOUNDLAND (LABRADOR)—XW
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES—XT
NOVA SCOTIA—XN
NUNAVUT—XV
ONTARIO—XO
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND—XP
QUEBEC—XQ
SASKATCHEWAN—XS
YUKON TERRITORY—XY
3. The next group of characters in the MID consists of the first three characters in each of the first two “words” of the manufacturer's name. If there is only one “word” in the name, then only the first three characters from the name are to be used. For example, “Amalgamated Plastics Corp.” would yield “AMAPLA,” and “Bergstrom” would yield “BER.” If there are two or more initials together, they are to be treated as a single word. For example, “A.B.C. Company” or “A B C Company” would yield “ABCCOM,” “O.A.S.I.S. Corp.” would yield “OASCOR,” “Dr. S.A. Smith” would yield “DRSA,” and “Shavings B L Inc.” would yield “SHABL.” The English words “a,” “an,” “and,” “of,” and “the” in the manufacturer's name are to be ignored. For example, “The Embassy of Spain” would yield “EMBSPA.” Portions of a name separated by a hyphen are to be treated as a single word. For example, “Rawles-Aden Corp.” or “Rawles—Aden Corp.” would both yield “RAWCOR.” Some names include numbers. For example, “20th Century Fox” would yield “20TCEN” and “Concept 2000” would yield “CON200.”
a. Some words in the title of the foreign manufacturer's name are not to be used for the purpose of constructing the MID. For example, most textile factories in Macau start with the same words, “Fabrica de Artigos de Vestuario,” which means “Factory of Clothing.” For a factory named “Fabrica de Artigos de Vestuario JUMP HIGH Ltd,” the portion of the factory name that identifies it as a unique entity is “JUMP HIGH.” This is the portion of the name that should be used to construct the MID. Otherwise, all of the MIDs from Macau would be the same, using “FABDE,” which is incorrect.
b. Similarly, many factories in Indonesia begin with the prefix PT, such as “PT Morich Indo Fashion.” In Russia, other prefixes are used, such as “JSC,” “OAO,” “OOO,” and “ZAO.” These prefixes are to be ignored for the purpose of constructing the MID.
4. The next group of characters in the MID consists of the first four numbers in the largest number on the street address line. For example, “11455 Main Street, Suite 9999” would yield “1145.” A suite number or a post office box is to be used if it contains the largest number. For example, “232 Main Street, Suite 1234” would yield “1234.” If the numbers in the street address are spelled out, such as “One Thousand Century Plaza,” no numbers representing the manufacturer's address will appear in this section of the MID. However, if the address is “One Thousand Century Plaza, Suite 345,” this would yield “345.” When commas or hyphens separate numbers, all punctuation is to be ignored and the number that remains is to be used. For example, “12,34,56 Alaska Road” and “12-34-56 Alaska Road” would yield “1234.” When numbers are separated by a space, both numbers are recognized and the larger of the two numbers is to be selected.
For example, “Apt. 509 2727 Cleveland St.” would yield “2727.”
5. The last characters in the MID consist of the first three letters in the city name. For example, “Tokyo” would yield “TOK,” “St. Michel” would yield “STM,” “18-Mile High” would yield “MIL,” and “The Hague” would yield “HAG.” Numbers in the city name or line are to be ignored. For city-states, the first three letters are to be taken from the country name. For example, Hong Kong would yield “HON,” Singapore would yield “SIN,” and Macau would yield “MAC.”
6. As a general rule, in constructing a MID, all punctuation, such as commas, periods, apostrophes, and ampersands, are to be ignored. All single character initials, such as the “S” in “Thomas S. Delvaux Company,” are also to be ignored, as are leading spaces in front of any name or address.
7. Examples of manufacturer names and addresses and their corresponding MIDs are listed below:

(d)
Originating component.
For purposes of this subpart, the term “originating component” references the CBP official, or the official's designee, in charge of the office responsible for the collection, assembly, or other preparation of the information demanded or that, at the time the person whose testimony is demanded acquired the information in question, employs or employed the person whose testimony is demanded.

Failure of CBP employee to follow procedures.
The failure of any CBP employee to follow the procedures specified in this subpart neither creates nor confers any rights, privileges, or benefits on any person or party.
(i)
In camera inspection of records.

§ 103.22
Procedure in the event of a demand for CBP information in any federal, state, or local civil proceeding or administrative action.
(a)
General prohibition against disclosure.
In any federal, state, or local civil proceeding or administrative action in which CBP is not a party, no CBP employee shall, in response to a demand for CBP information, furnish CBP documents or testimony as to any material contained in CBP files, any information relating to or based upon material contained in CBP files, or any information or material acquired as part of the performance of that person's official duties (or because of that person's official status) without the prior written approval of the Chief Counsel, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Employee notification to Counsel.
Whenever a demand for information is made upon a CBP employee, that employee shall immediately prepare a report that specifically describes the testimony or documents sought and notify the Assistant Chief Counsel or Associate Chief Counsel for the area where the employee is located. If the employee is located at Headquarters or outside of the United States, the employee shall immediately notify the Chief Counsel. The CBP employee shall then await instructions from the Chief Counsel concerning the response to the demand.
(c)
Requesting party's initial burden.
A party seeking CBP information shall serve on the appropriate CBP employee the demand, a copy of the Summons and Complaint, and provide an affidavit, or, if that is not feasible, a statement that sets forth a summary of the documents or testimony sought and its relevance to the proceeding. Any disclosure authorization for documents or testimony by a CBP employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as
summarized in such affidavit or statement. The Chief Counsel may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this paragraph.
(d)
Requesting party's notification requirement.
The demand for CBP information, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, shall be served at least ten (10) working days prior to the scheduled date of the production of the documents or the taking of testimony.

(f)
Conditions for authorization of disclosure.
The Chief Counsel, subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section, may authorize the production of CBP documents or the appearance and testimony of a CBP employee if:
(1) Production of the demanded documents or testimony, in the judgment of the Chief Counsel, are appropriate under the factors specified in § 103.23(a) of this subpart; and

(ii) There is no objection from the originating component to the disclosure of the information demanded; and
(iii) Counsel has sought to limit the demand for information to that which would be consistent with the factors specified in § 103.23 of this part.
(2) In the case of an objection by the originating component, the Chief Counsel shall make the disclosure determination.

§ 103.23
Factors in determining whether to disclose information pursuant to a demand.
(a)
General considerations.
In authorizing disclosures pursuant to a proper demand for CBP information, one which complies with the provisions of § 103.22(c), the Chief Counsel should consider the following factors:
(1) Whether the disclosure would be appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;
(2) Whether the disclosure would be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose; and,
(3) Whether the requesting party has demonstrated that the information requested is:
(i) Relevant and material to the action pending, based on copies of the summons and complaint that are required to be attached to the subpoena
duces tecum
or other demand;
(ii) Genuinely necessary to the proceeding,
i.e.,
a showing of substantial need has been made;
(iii) Unavailable from other sources; and,
(iv) Reasonable in its scope,
i.e.,
the documents, information, or testimony sought are described with particularity.
(4) Whether consultation with the originating component requires that the Chief Counsel make a separate determination as to the disclosure of the information requested.
(b)
Circumstances where disclosure will not be made.
Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be authorized by the Chief Counsel are those demands with respect to which any of the following factors exist:
(1) Disclosure would violate a treaty, statute (such as the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, or the income tax laws, 26
U.S.C. 6103 and 7213), or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, Fed.R.Crim.Proc. rule 6(e) (18 U.S.C.App.);
(2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation;
(3) Disclosure would reveal classified or confidential information;
(4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant;
(5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, interfere with enforcement proceedings, or disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
(6) Disclosure would improperly reveal confidential commercial information without the owner's consent (
e.g.,
entry information);
(7) Disclosure relates to documents which were produced by another agency or entity;
(8) Disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of CBP business;
(9) CBP has no interest, records, or other official information regarding the matter in which disclosure is sought;
(10) There is a failure to make proper service upon the United States; or
(11) There is a failure to comply with federal, state, or local rules of discovery.

If response to a demand is required before the instructions from the Chief Counsel are received, the U.S. Attorney, his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall be requested to appear with the CBP employee upon whom the demand has been made. The U.S. Attorney, his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this subpart, inform the court or other authority that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of the Chief Counsel, and shall respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.
[61 FR 19838, May 3, 1996, as amended at 78 FR 70856, Nov. 27, 2013]

Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.
If the court or other authority declines to stay the demand in response to a request made in accordance with § 103.24 pending receipt of instructions, or rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions rendered in accordance with §§ 103.22, 103.23, 103.26, or 103.27 of this subpart not to produce the documents or disclose the information sought, the CBP employee upon whom the demand has been made shall, pursuant to this subpart, respectfully decline to comply with the demand.

However, “customs business” does not include the mere electronic transmission of data received for transmission to CBP and does not include a corporate compliance activity.

“Qualifying continuing broker education” means any training or educational activity that is eligible or, if required, has been approved for continuing education credit, in accordance with § 111.103.
Records.
“Records” means documents, data and information referred to in, and required to be made or maintained under, this part and any other records, as defined in § 163.1(a) of this chapter, that are required to be maintained by a broker under part 163 of this chapter.
Responsible supervision and control.
“Responsible supervision and control” means that degree of supervision and control necessary to ensure the proper transaction of the customs business of a broker, including actions necessary to ensure that an employee of a broker provides substantially the same quality of service in handling customs transactions that the broker is required to provide.

§ 111.13

The examination for an individual broker's license will be designed to determine the individual's knowledge of customs and related laws, regulations and procedures, bookkeeping, accounting, and all other appropriate matters necessary to render valuable service to importers and exporters.

(b)
Basic requirements, date, and place of examination.
In order to be eligible to take the examination, an individual must on the date of examination be a citizen of the United States who has attained the age of 18 years and who is not an officer or employee of the United States Government. CBP will publish a notice announcing each examination on its Web site. Examinations will be given on the fourth Wednesday in April and October unless the regularly scheduled examination date conflicts with a national holiday, religious observance, or other foreseeable event and the agency publishes in the
Federal Register
an appropriate notice of a change in the examination date. An individual who intends to take the examination must complete the electronic application at least 30 calendar days prior to the scheduled examination date and must remit the examination fee prescribed in § 111.96(a) at that time. CBP will give notice of the time and place for the examination, including whether alternatives to on-site testing will be available, which is at CBP's sole discretion.
(c)
Special examination.
If a partnership, association, or corporation loses the required member or officer having an individual broker's license (see § 111.11(b) and (c)(2)) and its license would be revoked by operation of law under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1641(b)(5) and § 111.45(a) before the next scheduled examination, CBP may authorize a special examination for a prospective applicant for an individual license who would serve as the required licensed member or officer. CBP may also authorize a special examination for an individual for purposes of continuing the business of a sole proprietorship broker. A special examination for an individual may also be authorized by CBP if a brokerage firm loses the individual broker who was exercising responsible supervision and control over the transaction of customs
business before the next scheduled examination. A request for a special examination must be submitted to the Executive Assistant Commissioner, Office of Trade, in writing and must describe the circumstances giving rise to the need for the examination. If the request is granted, the Executive Assistant Commissioner, Office of Trade or his/her designee, will notify the prospective examinee of the exact time and place for the examination. If the individual attains a passing grade on the special examination, the application for the license may be submitted in accordance with § 111.12. The examinee will be responsible for all additional costs incurred by CBP in preparing and administering the special examination that exceed the examination fee prescribed in § 111.96(a), and those additional costs must be reimbursed to CBP before the examination is given.
(d)
Failure to appear for examination.
If a prospective examinee advises the Office of Trade at the Headquarters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attn: Broker Management Branch, electronically in a manner specified by CBP at least 2 working days prior to the date of a regularly scheduled examination that he will not appear for the examination, CBP will refund the examination fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this section. No refund of the examination fee or additional reimbursed costs will be made in the case of a special written examination provided for under paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Notice of examination result.
CBP will provide to each examinee written or electronic notice of the result of the examination taken under this section. A failure of an examinee to attain a passing grade on the examination will preclude the submission of an application under § 111.12 but will not preclude the examinee from taking an examination again at a later date in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(f)
Appeal of failing grade on examination.
If an examinee fails to attain a passing grade on the examination taken under this section, the examinee may challenge that result by filing a written or electronic appeal with the Office of Trade at the Headquarters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attn: Broker Management Branch, within 60 calendar days after the date of the written or electronic notice provided for in paragraph (e) of this section. CBP will provide to the examinee written or electronic notice of the decision on the appeal. If the CBP decision on the appeal affirms the result of the examination, the examinee may request review of the decision on the appeal by submitting a written or electronic request to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, within 60 calendar days after the date of the notice on that decision.

[T.D. 00-17, 65 FR 13891, Mar. 15, 2000, as amended by CBP Dec. 22-21, 87 FR 63316, Oct. 18, 2022]
§ 111.28
Responsible supervision and control.
(a)
General.
Every individual broker operating as a sole proprietor, every licensed member of a partnership that is a broker, and every licensed officer of an association or corporation that is a broker must exercise responsible supervision and control (see § 111.1) over the transaction of the customs business of the sole proprietorship, partnership, association, or corporation. A sole proprietorship, partnership, association, or corporation must employ a sufficient number of licensed brokers relative to the job complexity, similarity of subordinate tasks, physical proximity of subordinates, abilities and skills of employees, and abilities and skills of the managers. While the determination of what is necessary to perform and maintain responsible supervision and control will vary depending upon the circumstances in each instance, factors which CBP may consider in its discretion and to the extent any are relevant include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The training provided to broker employees;
(2) The issuance of instructions and guidelines to broker employees;
(3) The volume and type of business conducted by the broker;
(4) The reject rate for the various customs transactions relative to overall volume;
(5) The level of access broker employees have to current editions of CBP regulations, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, and CBP issuances;
(6) The availability of a sufficient number of individually licensed brokers for necessary consultation with employees of the broker;
(7) The frequency of supervisory visits of an individually licensed broker to another office of the broker that does not have an individually licensed broker;
(8) The frequency of audits and reviews by an individually licensed broker of the customs transactions handled by employees of the broker;
(9) The extent to which the individually licensed broker who qualifies the permit is involved in the operation of the brokerage and communications between CBP and the brokerage;
(10) Any circumstances which indicate that an individually licensed broker has a real interest in the operations of a brokerage;
(11) The timeliness of processing entries and payment of duty, tax, or other debt or obligation owing to the Government for which the broker is responsible, or for which the broker has received payment from a client;
(12) Communications between CBP and the broker, and the broker's responsiveness and action to communications, direction, and notices from CBP;
(13) Communications between the broker and its officer(s) or member(s), and the broker's responsiveness and action to communications and direction from its officer(s) or member(s).
(b)
Employee information
—(1)
Current employees.
Each national permit holder must submit to the processing Center a list of the names of persons currently employed by the broker. The list of employees must be submitted prior to issuance of a national permit under § 111.19 and before the broker begins to transact customs business. For each employee, the broker must provide the name, social security number, date and place of birth, date of hire, and current home address. After the initial submission, an updated list must be submitted to a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange (EDI) system if any of the information required by this paragraph changes. If a CBP-authorized EDI system is not available, then the information must be provided in writing to the processing Center. The update must be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of the change.
(2)
New employees.
Within thirty (30) calendar days of the start of employment of a new employee(s), the broker must submit a list of new employee(s) with the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a CBP-authorized EDI system. The broker may submit a list of the new employee(s) or an updated list of all employees, specifically noting the new employee(s). If a CBP-authorized EDI system is not available, then the information must be provided in writing to the processing Center.
(3)
Terminated employees.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the termination of employment of an employee, the broker must submit a list of terminated employee(s) to a CBP-authorized EDI system. The broker may submit a list of the terminated employee(s) or an updated list of all employees, specifically noting the terminated employee(s). If a CBP-authorized EDI system is not available, then the information must be provided in writing to the processing Center.
(c)
Broker's responsibility.
Notwithstanding a broker's responsibility for providing the information required in paragraph (b) of this section, in the absence of culpability by the broker, CBP will not hold the broker responsible for the accuracy of any information that is provided to the broker by the employee.
(d)
Termination of qualifying member or officer.
In the case of an individual broker who is a qualifying member of a partnership for purposes of § 111.11(b) or who is a qualifying officer of an association or corporation for purposes of § 111.11(c)(2), that individual broker must immediately provide written notice to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, when his employment as a qualifying member or officer terminates and must send a copy of the written notice to the processing Center.
(e)
Change in ownership.
If the ownership of a broker changes and ownership shares in the broker are not publicly traded, the broker must immediately provide written notice of that fact to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, and must send a copy of the written notice to the processing Center. When a change in ownership results in the addition of a new principal to the organization, and whether or not ownership shares in the broker are publicly traded, CBP reserves the right to conduct a background investigation on the new principal. The processing Center will notify the broker if CBP objects to the new principal, and the broker will be given a reasonable period of time to remedy the situation. If the background investigation uncovers information which would have been the basis for a denial of an application for a broker's license and the principal's interest in the broker is not terminated to the satisfaction of the processing Center, suspension or revocation proceedings may be initiated under subpart D of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, a “principal” means any person having at least a five (5) percent capital, beneficiary or other direct or indirect interest in the business of a broker.
[T.D. 00-17, 65 FR 13891, Mar. 15, 2000, as amended by CBP Dec. 22-21, 87 FR 63316, Oct. 18, 2022]

Diligence in correspondence and paying monies.
(a)
Due diligence by broker.
Each broker must exercise due diligence in making financial settlements, in answering correspondence, and in preparing or assisting in the preparation and filing of records relating to any customs business matter handled by him as a broker. Payment of duty, tax, or other debt or obligation owing to the Government for which the broker is responsible, or for which the broker has received payment from a client, must be made to the Government on or before the date that payment is due. Payments received by a broker from a client after the due date must be transmitted to the Government within 5 working days from receipt by the broker. Each broker must provide a written statement to a client accounting for funds received for the client from the Government, or received from a client where no payment to the Government has been made, or received from a client in excess of the Governmental or other charges properly payable as part of the client's customs business, within 60 calendar days of receipt. No written statement is required if there is actual payment of the funds by a broker.
(b)
Notice to client of method of payment
. (1) All brokers must provide their clients with the following written notification:
If you are the importer of record, payment to the broker will not relieve you of liability for customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed CBP) in the event the charges are not paid by the broker. Therefore, if you pay by check, customs charges may be paid with
a separate check payable to the “U.S. Customs and Border Protection” which will be delivered to CBP by the broker.
(2) The written notification set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be provided by brokers as follows:
(i) On, or attached to, any power of attorney provided by the broker to a client for execution on or after September 27, 1982; and
(ii) To each active client no later than February 28, 1983, and at least once at any time within each 12-month period after that date. An active client means a client from whom a broker has obtained a power of attorney and for whom the broker has transacted customs business on at least two occasions within the 12-month period preceding notification.
§ 111.30
Notification of change in address, organization, name, or location of business records; status report; termination of brokerage business.
(a)
Change of address.
A broker is responsible for providing CBP with the broker's current addresses, which include the broker's office of record address as defined in § 111.1, an email address, and, if the broker is not actively engaged in transacting business as a broker, the broker's non-business address. If a broker does not receive mail at the broker's office of record or non-business address, the broker must also provide CBP with a valid address at which he or she receives mail. When address information (the broker's office of record address, mailing address, email address) changes, or the broker is no longer actively engaged in transacting business as a broker, he or she must update his or her address information within ten (10) calendar days through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange (EDI) system.

(c)
Change in name.
A broker who changes his or her name, or who proposes to operate under a trade or fictitious name in one or more States and is authorized by State law to do so, must submit to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, at the Headquarters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, evidence of his or her authority to use that name. The name must not be used until the approval of Headquarters has been received. In the case of a trade or fictitious name, the broker must affix his own name in conjunction with each signature of the trade or fictitious name when signing customs documents.
(d)
Triennial status report
—(1)
General.
Each broker must file a triennial status report with CBP on February 1 of each third year after 1985. The report must be filed through a CBP-authorized EDI system and will not be considered received by CBP until payment of the triennial status report fee prescribed in § 111.96(d) is received. If a CBP-authorized EDI system is not available, the triennial status report must be filed with the processing Center. A report received during the month of February will be considered filed timely.

If a broker fails to file the report required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section by March 1 of the reporting year, the broker's license is suspended by operation of law on that date. By March 31 of the reporting year, CBP will transmit written notice of the suspension to the broker by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address reflected in CBP records. If the broker files the required report and pays the required fee within 60 calendar days of the date of the notice of suspension, the license will be reinstated. If the broker does not file the required report and pay the required fee within that 60-day period, the broker's license is revoked by operation of law without prejudice to the filing of an application for a new license. Notice of the revocation will be published in the
Federal Register
.

§ 111.51
Cancellation of license or permit.
(a)

§ 111.55
Investigation of complaints.
Every complaint or charge against a broker which may be the basis for disciplinary action may be forwarded for investigation to the appropriate investigative authority within the Department of Homeland Security.

§ 111.56

The statement of charges also must specify the sanction being proposed (that is, suspension of the license or permit or revocation of the license or permit), but if a suspension is proposed the charges need not state a specific period of time for which suspension is proposed. A statement of charges which fairly informs the broker of the charges against him so that he is able to prepare his response will be deemed sufficient. Different means by which a purpose might have been accomplished, or different intents with which acts might have been done, so as to constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of the license may be alleged in the alternative under a single count in the statement of charges.

The broker's request must set forth in what respect the proposed statement of charges leaves him in doubt and must describe the particular language of the proposed statement of charges as to which additional information is needed.

If one or more of the charges in the proposed statement of charges was satisfactorily answered by the broker in the preliminary proceedings, the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, will instruct the processing Center to omit those charges from the statement of charges.

Accreditation is not required for trainings or educational activities offered by U.S. government agencies.
(ii)
Other providers requiring accreditation.
Any other training or educational activity not offered by a U.S. government agency, whether online or in-person, will not be considered a qualifying continuing broker education, unless the training or educational activity has been approved for continuing education credit by a CBP-selected accreditor before the training or educational activity is provided.
(2)

The training or educational activity must constitute one of the following:
(i) A seminar, webinar, or a workshop, whether online or in-person, whether experienced live or recorded, that is conducted by an instructor, discussion leader, or speaker;

(c)
Selection of accreditors.
The Office of Trade will select accreditors based on a Request for Information (RFI) and a Request for Proposal (RFP) announced through the System for Award Management (SAM) or any other electronic system for award management approved by the U.S. General Services Administration, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR 1.000

(d)
Responsibilities of CBP-selected accreditors.
CBP-selected accreditors administer the accreditation of trainings or educational activities other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the purpose of the continuing broker education requirement by reviewing and approving or denying such educational content for continuing education credit. A CBP-selected accreditor's approval of a training or educational activity for continuing education credit is valid for one year, and the accreditation may be renewed through any CBP-selected accreditor. CBP-selected accreditors will not deny review or approval of a training or educational activity for continuing education credit solely because it was previously denied by the CBP-selected accreditor or any other CBP-selected accreditor.
(e)

CBP-selected accreditors may not approve their own trainings or educational activities for continuing education credit.

§ 113.2
Powers of Commissioner of CBP relating to bonds.
Whenever a bond is required or authorized by law, regulation, or instruction, the Commissioner of CBP may:

(b) Provide for the approval of the sureties on the bond, without regard to any general provision of law.
(c) Authorize the execution of a term bond, the conditions of which will extend to and cover similar cases of importations over a period of time, not to exceed one year or such longer period as he may fix, when in his opinion special circumstances warrant a longer period.

If the value or nature of the merchandise to be imported will change in any material respect during the next year the change must be identified. If no imports were made during the calendar year prior to the application, a statement of the duties and taxes it is estimated will accrue on all importations during the current year shall be submitted.

§ 113.13
Amount of bond.
(a)
Minimum amount of bond.
The amount of any CBP bond must not be less than $100, except when the law or regulation expressly provides that a lesser amount may be taken. Fractional parts of a dollar will be disregarded in computing the amount of a bond. The bond always will be stated as the next highest dollar.
(b)
Guidelines for determining amount of bond.
In determining whether the amount of a bond is sufficient, CBP will consider:
(1) The prior record of the principal in timely payment of duties, taxes, and charges with respect to the transaction(s) involving such payments;
(2) The prior record of the principal in complying with CBP demands for redelivery, the obligation to hold unexamined merchandise intact, and other requirements relating to enforcement and administration of customs and other laws and CBP regulations;
(3) The value and nature of the merchandise involved in the transaction(s) to be secured;
(4) The degree and type of supervision that CBP will exercise over the transaction(s);
(5) The prior record of the principal in honoring bond commitments, including the payment of liquidated damages; and
(6) Any additional information contained in any application for a bond.
(c)
Periodic review of bond sufficiency.
CBP will periodically review each bond on file to determine whether the bond is adequate to protect the revenue and ensure compliance with applicable law and regulations. If CBP determines that a bond is inadequate, the principal and surety will be promptly notified in writing. The principal will have 15 days from the date of notification to remedy the deficiency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where CBP determines that a bond is insufficient to adequately protect the revenue and ensure compliance with applicable law and regulations, CBP may provide written notice to the principal and surety that, upon receipt thereof, additional security in the form of cash deposit or single transaction bond may be required for any and all of the principal's transactions until the deficiency is remedied.
(d)
Additional security.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other provision of this chapter, if CBP believes that acceptance of a transaction secured by a continuous bond would place the revenue in jeopardy or otherwise hamper the enforcement of all applicable laws or regulations, CBP may immediately require additional security.

§ 113.15
Retention of approved bonds.
Except for bonds containing an agreement to pay court costs (condemned goods) (
see
§ 113.72), and except as may otherwise be deemed appropriate by CBP, bonds that are approved by the port director will be retained at the port office and bonds that are approved by the Revenue Division (including bonds relating to repayment of erroneous drawback payments containing the conditions set forth in § 113.65) will be retained at the Revenue Division.
