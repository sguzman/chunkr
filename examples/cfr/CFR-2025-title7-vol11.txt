# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1700.104
Financial feasibility.
Pursuant to normal underwriting practices, and such reasonable alternatives within the discretion of RUS that contribute to a financial feasibility determination for a particular eligible program or project, the Administrator will only make grants, loans and loan guarantees that RUS finds to be financially feasible and that provide eligible program benefits to substantially underserved trust areas.

§ 1700.105
Determining whether land meets the statutory definition of “trust land.”
The Administrator will use one or more of the following resources in determining whether a particular community is located in Trust land:
(a) Official maps of Federal Indian Reservations based on information compiled by the U. S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and made available to the public;

§ 1700.106
Discretionary provisions.
(a) To improve the availability of eligible programs in eligible communities determined to have a high need for the benefits of an eligible program, the Administrator retains the discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to use any of the following SUTA authorities individually or in combination to:
(1) Make available to qualified applicants financing with an interest rate as low as 2 percent;
(2) Extend repayment terms;
(3) Waive (individually or in combination) non-duplication restrictions, matching fund requirements, and credit support requirements from any loan or grant program administered by RUS; and
(4) Give the highest funding priority to designated projects in substantially underserved trust areas.
(b) Requests for waivers of nonduplication restrictions, matching fund requirements, and credit support requirements, and requests for highest funding priority will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis upon written request of the applicant filed pursuant to 7 CFR 1700.108.
(c) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator reserves the right to evaluate any application for an eligible program for use of the discretionary provisions of this subpart without a formal, written request from the applicant.
§ 1700.107
Considerations relevant to the exercise of SUTA discretionary provisions.
(a) In considering requests to make available financing with an interest
rate as low as 2 percent, and extended repayment terms, the Administrator will evaluate the effect of and need for such terms on the finding of financial feasibility.
(b) In considering a request for a non-duplication waiver, the Administrator will consider the offerings of all existing service providers to determine whether or not granting the non-duplication waiver is warranted. A waiver of non-duplication restrictions will not be given if the Administrator determines as a matter of financial feasibility that, taking into account all existing service providers, an applicant or RUS borrower would not be able to repay a loan or successfully implement a grant agreement. Requests for waivers of non-duplication restrictions will be reviewed by taking the following factors into consideration:
(1) The size, extent and demographics of the duplicative area;
(2) The cost of service from existing service providers;
(3) The quality of available service; and
(4) The ability of the existing service provider to serve the eligible service area.
(c) Requests for waivers of matching fund requirements will be evaluated by taking the following factors into consideration:
(1) Whether waivers or reductions in matching or equity requirements would make an otherwise financially infeasible project financially feasible;
(2) Whether permitting a matching requirement to be met with sources not otherwise permitted in an affected program due to regulatory prohibition may be allowed under a separate statutory authority; and
(3) Whether the application could be ranked and scored as if the matching requirements were fully met.
(d) Requests for waivers of credit support requirements will be evaluated taking the following factors into consideration:
(1) The cost and availability of credit support relative to the loan security derived from such support;
(2) The extent to which the requirement is shown to be a barrier to the applicant's participation in the program; and
(3) The alternatives to waiving the requirements.
(e) The Administrator may adapt the manner of assigning highest funding priority to align with the selection methods used for particular programs or funding opportunities.
(1) Eligible programs which use priority point scoring may, in a notice of funds availability or similar notice, assign extra points for SUTA eligible applicants as a means to exercise a discretionary authority under this subpart.
(2) The Administrator may announce a competitive grant opportunity focused exclusively or primarily on trust lands which incorporates one or more discretionary authorities under this subpart into the rules or scoring for the competition.
§ 1700.108
Application requirements.
(a) To receive consideration under this subpart, the applicant must submit to RUS a completed application that includes all of the information required for an application in accordance with the regulations relating to the program for which financial assistance is being sought. In addition, the applicant must notify the RUS contact for the applicable program in writing that it seeks consideration under this subpart and identify the discretionary authorities of this subpart it seeks to have applied to its application.

(b) The applicant must provide any additional information RUS may consider relevant to the application which is necessary to adequately evaluate the application under this subpart.
(c) RUS may also request modifications or changes, including changes in the amount of funds requested, in any proposal described in an application submitted under this subpart.
(d) The applicant must submit a completed application within the application window and guidelines for an eligible program.
§ 1700.109
RUS review.
(a) RUS will review the application to determine whether the applicant is eligible to receive consideration under this subpart and whether the application is timely, complete, and responsive to the requirements set forth in 7 CFR 1700.107.
(b) If the Administrator determines that the application is eligible to receive consideration under this subpart and one or more SUTA requests are granted, the applicant will be so notified.
(c) If RUS determines that the application is not eligible to receive further consideration under this subpart, RUS will so notify the applicant. The applicant may withdraw its application or request that RUS treat its application as an ordinary application for review, feasibility analysis and service area verification by RUS consistent with the regulations and guidelines normally applicable to the relevant program.

Eligibility criteria for deferment of loan payments.
The deferment of loan payments may be granted to any borrower that is not financially distressed, delinquent on any Federal debt, or in bankruptcy proceedings. However, the deferment of loan payments will not be granted to a borrower during any period in which the Administrator has determined that no additional financial assistance of any nature should be provided to the borrower pursuant to any provision of the RE Act. The determination to suspend eligibility for the deferment of loan payments under this subpart will be based on:

(b) The borrower's demonstrated unwillingness to meet the requirements in RUS's or RTB's legal documents or regulations.
§ 1703.304
Restrictions on the deferment of loan payments.
(a) The deferment must not impair the security of any loans made RUS or RTB, or guaranteed by RUS, pursuant to the RE Act.
(b) At no point in time may the amount of the debt service payments deferred exceed 50 percent of the total cost of a community, business, or economic development project for which a deferment is provided.
(c) A borrower may defer debt service payments only in an amount equal to the investment made by such borrower in a rural development project. The investment must not be made from:
(1) Proceeds of loans made or guaranteed pursuant to the RE Act, or grants made pursuant to the RE Act or section 2331 through section 2335A of the Rural Economic Development Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 950aaa

(2) Funds necessary to make timely payments of principal and interest on loans made, guaranteed or lien accommodated pursuant to the RE Act;
(3) Insurance proceeds from mortgaged property;

(5) Sale proceeds from mortgaged property sales requiring specific Administrator approval; and
(6) Funds which are restricted by RUS or RTB loan instruments to be held in trust for the Government or to be held for any other specific purpose.
(d) Any investment made in a rural development project prior to the date of the application for a deferment based on such project cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of this section.
§ 1703.305
Requirements for deferment of loan payments.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the borrower must make a cushion of credit payment equal to the amount of the payment deferred and subject to the following rules:
(1) Cushion of credit payments made prior to the date that an application for deferral has been approved by RUS cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of this section;
(2) Once a cushion of credit payment has been made to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, it must remain on deposit in the cushion of credit account on the date of the deferral or the deferral will not take place; and
(3) The cushion of credit payment must be received by RUS on the date the payment being deferred is due, or within 30 days prior to this date.
(b) A borrower may elect to consolidate in one application filed pursuant to § 1703.311, all of the related deferrals it wishes to receive in a twelve month period following application approval.

§ 1703.306
Limitation on funds derived from the deferment of loan payments.
Funds derived from the deferment of loan payments will not be used:
(a) To fund or assist projects which would, in the judgement of the Administrator, create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. The borrower must disclose to the Administrator information regarding any potential conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest;
(b) For any purpose not reasonably related to the project as determined by the Administrator;
(c) To transfer existing employment or business activities from one area to another; or
(d) For the borrower's electric or telephone operations, nor for any operations affiliated with the borrower unless the Administrator has specifically informed the borrower in writing that the affiliated operations are part of the approved purposes.
§ 1703.307
Uses of the deferments of loan payments.
The deferment of loan payments will be made to enable the borrower to provide funding and assistance for rural development and job creation projects.

(b) The total amount of annual deferments are subject to limitations established by appropriations Acts.
§ 1703.309
Terms of repayment of deferred loan payments.
(a) Deferments made to enable the borrower to provide financing to local businesses will be repaid over a period of 60 months, in equal installments, with payments beginning on the date of the deferment, and continuing in such a manner until the total amount of the deferment is repaid.

§ 1709.106
Eligible applicants.
(a) Eligible applicants for grants to fund projects serving eligible extremely high energy cost communities include Persons, States, political subdivisions of States, and other entities organized under the laws of States.
(b) Eligible applicants may be for-profit or non-profit business entities including but not limited to corporations, associations, partnerships, limited liability partnerships (LLPs), cooperatives, trusts, and sole proprietorships.
(c) Eligible government applicants include State and local governments, and agencies and instrumentalities of States and local governments.
(d) Indian tribes, other tribal entities, and Alaska Native Corporations are eligible applicants.
(e) Individuals are also eligible applicants under this program, however the proposed grant project must provide community benefits and not be for the sole benefit of the individual applicant or an individual household.
(f) As a condition of eligibility, the applicant must demonstrate the capacity:
(1) to enter into a binding grant agreement with the Federal Government at the time of the award approval; and
(2) to carry out the proposed grant project according to its terms.
§ 1709.107
Eligible communities.
(a) An eligible community under this program is one in which the average home energy costs exceed 275 percent of the national average under one or more high energy cost benchmarks established by RUS based on the latest available residential energy information from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the United States Department of Energy. RUS will update the national and high energy cost community benchmarks periodically to incorporate any changes in national home energy costs reported by EIA. RUS will publish the high energy cost community benchmark criteria in the grant announcement. Community eligibility will be determined by RUS at the time of application based on the criteria published in the applicable grant announcement.
(b) The Application must include information demonstrating that each community in the grant's proposed target area exceeds one or more of the RUS high energy cost community benchmarks to be eligible for assistance under this program. The smallest area that may be designated as a target area is a Census block according to the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census).
(c) The target community may include an extremely high cost to serve portion of a larger service area that does not otherwise meet the criteria, provided that the applicant can establish that the costs to serve the smaller target area exceed the benchmark.
(d) In determining the community energy costs, applicants may include additional revenue sources that lower the rates or out of pocket consumer energy costs such as rate averaging, and other Federal, State, or private cost contributions or subsidies.
(e) The applicant may propose a project that will serve high energy cost communities across a State or region, but where individual project beneficiaries will be selected at a later time.

Unless supplemented in the grant announcement, the criteria listed in this section will be used to evaluate proposals submitted under this program. Additional criteria may be included in the grant announcement. In establishing evaluation criteria and weights, the total points that may be awarded for project design and technical merit criteria shall not be less than 65 percent of the total available points, and the total points awarded for priority criteria shall not be more than 35 percent of the total available points. The distribution of points to be awarded per criterion will be identified in the grant announcement.
(b)
Project design and technical merit.
In reviewing the grant proposal's project design and technical merit, reviewers will consider the soundness of the applicant's approach, the project's technical and financial feasibility, the adequacy of financial and other resources, the capabilities and experience of the applicant and its project management team, the project goals, and identified community needs and benefits. Points will be awarded under the following project elements:
(1)
Comprehensiveness and feasibility.
Reviewers will assess the technical and economic feasibility of the project and how well its goals and objectives address the challenges of the eligible communities. The panel will review the proposed design, construction, equipment and materials for the proposed energy facilities to determine technical feasibility. Reviewers may propose additional conditions on the grant award to assure that the project is technically sound. Budgets will be reviewed for completeness and the strength of non-Federal funding commitments. Points may not be awarded unless sufficient detail is provided to determine whether or not funds are being used for qualified purposes. Reviewers will consider the adequacy of the applicant's budget and resources to carry out the project as proposed. Reviewers will also evaluate how the applicant proposes to manage available resources such as grant funds, income generated from the facilities and any other financing sources to maintain and operate a financially viable project once the grant period has ended. Reviewers must make a finding of operational sustainability for any points to be awarded. Projects for which future grant funding is likely to be required in order to assure ongoing operations will not receive any points.
(2)
Demonstrated experience.
Reviewers will consider whether the applicant or its project team have demonstrated experience in successfully administering and carrying out projects that are comparable to that proposed in the application. The reviewers may assign a higher point score to proposals that develop the internal capacity to provide or improve energy services in the eligible communities over other proposals that rely extensively on temporary outside contractors.
(3)
Community needs.
Reviewers will consider the applicant's assessment of community energy needs to be addressed by the proposed project as well as the severity of physical and economic challenges affecting the target communities. In determining whether one proposal should receive more points than another under this criterion, reviewers will consider the relative burdens placed on the communities and individual households by extremely high energy costs, the hardships created by limited access to reliable and affordable energy services and the availability of other resources to support or supplement the proposed grant funding.
(4)
Project evaluation and performance measures.
Reviewers will consider the applicant's suggested project evaluation and performance criteria. Reviewers may award higher points to criteria that are quantifiable, directly relevant to project goals, and reflect serious consideration than to more subjective performance criteria that do not incorporate variables that reflect a reduction in energy cost or improvement in service.
(5)
Coordination with rural development initiatives.
Proposals that include documentation confirming coordination with State rural development initiatives may be credited points for this criterion.
(c)
Priority considerations.
Subject to the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, evaluation points may also be awarded for projects that advance identified priority interests identified in the grant announcement to assist the Agency in selecting among competing projects when the amount of funding requests exceed available funds. The grant announcement may incorporate all or some of the priority criteria listed below, and as discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the grant announcement may supplement these criteria. The announcement will also specify the points that will be awarded to qualifying applications under these priority criteria.
(1)
Community economic hardship.
Economic hardship points may be awarded where the median household income for the target community is significantly below the State average or where the target community suffers from economic conditions that severely constrain its ability to provide or improve energy facilities serving the community. Applicants must describe in detail and document conditions creating severe community economic hardship in the proposal.
(2)
Rurality.
Priority consideration may be given to proposals that serve
smaller rural communities. Applications will be scored based on the population of the largest incorporated cities, towns or villages or census designated places included within the grant's proposed target area as determined using the population figures from the most recent decennial Census. If the applicable population figure cannot be based on the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.
(3)
Unserved energy needs.
Points may be awarded to projects that extend or improve electric or other energy services to eligible communities or areas of eligible communities that do not have reliable centralized or commercial service.
(4)
Imminent hazard.
Additional points may be awarded for projects that correct a condition posing an imminent hazard to public safety, public welfare, the environment, or to a critical community or residential energy facility in immediate danger of failure because of a deteriorated condition, capacity limitation, or damage from a natural disaster or accident.
(5)
Cost sharing.
Projects that evidence significant commitments of funds, contributed property, equipment, or other in kind support for the project may be awarded additional points for this criterion where the aggregate value of these contributions exceed ten percent of total eligible project costs.

Evaluation criteria and weights.
Unless supplemented in the grant announcement, the criteria listed in this section will be used to evaluate proposals submitted under this program. The total points available and the distribution of points to be awarded per criterion will be identified in the grant announcement.
(a)
Program Design.
Reviewers will consider the financial viability of the applicant's revolving fund program design, the proposed criteria for establishing eligible projects and borrowers, and how the program will improve the cost effectiveness of bulk fuel purchases in eligible areas. Programs demonstrating a strong design and the ability to improve cost effectiveness will receive more points than applications that are less detailed.
(b)
Assessment of needs.
Reviewers will award more points to programs that serve or give priority to assisting more costly areas than those that serve populations that suffer from less severe physical and economic challenges.
(c)
Program evaluation and performance measures.
Reviewers may award more points to performance measures that are relevant to the project objective and quantifiable than to performance measures that are more subjective and do not incorporate variables that reflect a reduction in fuel cost or improvement in service.
(d)
Demonstrated experience.
Applicants may be awarded points for relevant experience in administering revolving fund or other comparable programs.
(e)
Rurality.
Reviewers may award more points to proposals that give priority in access to funds to communities with low population density or that are located in remote eligible areas than to proposals that serve eligible, but less remote and higher population density communities.
(f)
Cost sharing.
Although cost-sharing is not required under this program, projects that evidence significant funding or contributed property, equipment or other in kind support for the project may be awarded points for this criterion where the aggregate value of these contributions exceed 25 percent of the annual funding operations.
(g)
Additional priority considerations.
The grant announcement may provide for additional points to be awarded to projects that advance identified Agency priority interests under this program.
§ 1709.217
Grant award.
(a)
Notification of applicants.
The Agency will notify all applicants in writing whether or not they have been selected for a grant award.
(b)
Letter of conditions.
The Agency will notify a selected applicant in writing, setting out the amount of grant approved and the conditions under which the grant will be made.
(c)
Applicant's intent to meet conditions.
Upon reviewing the conditions and requirements in the letter of conditions, the selected applicant must complete, sign and return the Agency's “Letter of Intent to Meet Conditions,” or, if certain conditions cannot be met, the applicant may propose alternate conditions to the Agency. The Agency must concur with any changes proposed to the letter of conditions by the applicant before the application will be further processed.
(d)
Grant agreement.

# Subpart B—Types of Loans and Loan Guarantees
§ 1710.50
Insured loans.
RUS makes insured loans under section 305 of the RE Act.
(a)
Municipal rate loans.
The standard interest rate on an insured loan made on or after November 1, 1993, is the municipal rate, which is the rate determined by the Administrator to be equal to the current market yield on outstanding municipal obligations with remaining periods to maturity, up to 35 years, similar to the interest rate term selected by the borrower. In certain cases, an interest rate cap of 7 percent may apply. The interest rate term and rollover maturity date for a municipal rate loan will be determined pursuant to 7 CFR part 1714, and the borrower may elect to include in the loan documents a prepayment option (call provision).
(b)
Hardship rate loans.
RUS makes hardship rate loans at the 5 percent hardship rate to qualified borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in 7 CFR 1714.8
[58 FR 66263, Dec. 20, 1993]
§ 1710.51
Direct loans.
RUS makes direct loans under section 4 of the RE Act.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise modified by this section, RUS will make loans under the direct Treasury rate loan program in the same manner that it makes loans under the municipal rate program. The general and pre-loan policies and procedures for municipal rate electric loans made by RUS may be found in this part and 7 CFR part 1714. Treasury rate electric loans are also governed by such municipal rate policies and procedures, except as follows:
(1)
Interest rates.
The standard interest rate on direct Treasury rate loans will be established daily by the United States Treasury. The borrower will select interest rate terms for each advance of funds. The minimum interest rate term shall be one year. Interest rate terms will be limited to terms published by the Treasury (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30). Interest rate terms to final maturity date, if other than published by Treasury, will be determined by RUS. Interest rates for terms greater than 30 years will be at the 30-year rate. There will be no interest rate cap on Treasury rate loans.
(2)
Prepayment.
A Treasury rate direct electric loan may be repaid at par on its rollover maturity date if there is one. Such a loan, or portion thereof, may also be prepaid after it has been advanced for not less than two years, at any time prior to its rollover or
final maturity date at its “net present value” (NPV) as determined by RUS.
(3)
Supplemental financing.
Supplemental financing will not be required in connection with Treasury rate direct electric loans.
(4)
Transitional assistance.
A Treasury rate direct loan is not available to provide transitional assistance to borrowers.
(b)
Loan documents.
Successful applicants will be required to execute and deliver to RUS a promissory note evidencing the borrower's obligation to repay the loan. The note must be in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. RUS will require a form of note substantially in the form that it currently accepts for direct municipal rate electric loans, with such revisions as may be necessary or appropriate to reflect the different interest setting provisions and the terms of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. All notes will be secured in accordance with the terms of 7 CFR part 1718.
[66 FR 66294, Dec. 26, 2001]
§ 1710.52
Loan guarantees.
RUS provides financing through 100 percent loan guarantees made under sections 306 and 306A of the RE Act. RUS also provides 90 percent loan guarantees under section 311 of the RE Act to enable borrowers to secure financing from certain private lenders. The loan guarantees are made for a term of up to 35 years, and the interest rate is established at a rate agreed to by the borrower and the lender, with RUS concurrence. The guarantee applies to the repayment of both principal and interest.
[58 FR 66264, Dec. 20, 1993]
§ 1710.53
Refinancing.
(a)
General.
(1) Subject to the availability of funds for such purpose, RUS may use loan funds to refinance prior loans made or guaranteed under the RE Act, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 902(a)). Such refinancing must be in the interest of rural consumers, taxpayers, rural economic development or otherwise in the public interest, as determined by the Administrator.
(2) The Secretary's authority to make loans for refinancing under this section is in addition to any other authority granted to the Secretary to make or modify loans under the RE Act or any other statutory authority.
(3) Nothing in this section changes the policies or standards set forth in 7 CFR part 1717, subpart Y, or the terms and conditions of the agreements entered into between RUS and FFB or the notes issued to RUS or FFB in connection with RUS or FFB loans.
(4) When funds are made available under this section, RUS will issue a public notice in the
Federal Register
specifying the amount of funds available under this section. The notice will contain additional application procedures specific to the amount and type of funding available and new loan application periods related to the availability of funds. The notice may also include Administration priorities, such as directing benefits to disadvantaged communities and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator, in setting funding priorities and application periods, may consider the amount of available funds, RUS resources, RUS priorities and policy goals, and any other factors related to the efficient operation of the agency.
(b)
Definitions.
For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the following meanings. Terms not defined here are defined in § 1710.2. When the definitions provided in this section conflict with any other definition applicable to RUS Electric Program regulations in this chapter, including § 1710.2, the definition of this section will control only as it relates to refinancing under this section.
Advance
means advance or advances of loan funds made by RUS to the borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions in the loan documents.
Agency
means the Rural Utilities Service or its successor.
Conditional commitment letter
means the notification issued by the Administrator to an eligible entity advising it of the estimated terms, conditions, and amount of the new loan.
Eligible entity
means an RUS Electric Program borrower with an unpaid and outstanding FFB loan or RUS loan.
FFB
means the Federal Financing Bank.
FFB loan
means a loan made by FFB and guaranteed by RUS pursuant to the RE Act for electric purposes.
RUS loan
means a loan made by the RUS under the RE Act for electric purposes.

Loans under this section may only be made to an eligible entity for the purposes indicated in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Eligible loans for refinancing.
Only FFB loans and RUS loans as defined in this section are eligible for refinancing under this section.
(e)
Allocation of funds under this section.
Unless prohibited by congressional appropriation or statute, in allocating the funds available to RUS under its lending authority, the Administrator may determine, on a programmatic or case by case basis, that other RE Act loan purposes take priority over refinancing. The Administrator may, but is not limited to, consider the following factors in making this determination:
(1) The overall availability of funding compared to anticipated loan demand;
(2) The best interests of rural consumers;
(3) The protection of the Government's financial interest in existing loans and collateral; and
(4) Broader policy objectives, including directing benefits to disadvantaged communities, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and other priorities of the Secretary of Agriculture.
(f)
Application process.
(1) When funds are available, the RUS will publish a notice identifying the amount and type of funds available for refinancing for the funding period in total and per applicant. The notice will identify the priorities established by the Agency for the use of the available funds. Borrowers seeking to refinance RUS loans or FFB loans will be required to submit, at a minimum, the following information:
(i) Borrower reference number;
(ii) Note designation;
(iii) Rural Electric Telephone (RET) Advance loan account number;
(iv) FFB complete identifier for an FFB loan;
(v) Date(s) of advance;
(vi) Interest rate;
(vii) Principal outstanding;
(viii) Current final maturity date;
(ix) Short narrative explaining how the proposed refinancing would be in the interest of rural consumers, taxpayers, rural economic development or otherwise in the public interest; and
(x) The requested final maturity date for the new loan. The requested final maturity date must be for a period not to exceed the maximum maturity date allowed by statute, regulation, or applicable notice. An eligible entity must submit a certification that the remaining useful life of its electric system is equal to or exceeds the new requested final maturity date and, that the requested final maturity date does not exceed the term of its wholesale power contract with its members or with its generation and transmission supplier (where applicable).
(2) The Agency reserves the right to offer a loan under this section with a maturity date that varies from the requested date. Unless the Administrator makes a specific determination to the contrary, the Electric Program will not approve a new loan that includes a final maturity date that exceeds the remaining useful life of its electric system or any applicable wholesale power contract term.
(3) On a case-by-case basis, as necessary, the Administrator may approve a new loan that includes a final maturity that exceeds the remaining useful life of the applicant's electric system or applicable wholesale power contract term provided the Administrator finds that the requirements contained in § 1710.151 are satisfied, the new loan is feasible under § 1710.151(b), and such action addresses critical environmental or consumer needs.
(g)
Loan requirements.
(1) All refinancing loans made under this section
must be in the interest of rural consumers, taxpayers, rural economic development, or otherwise in the public interest.
(2) All refinancing loans made under this section must be feasible as determined by RUS based on the financial condition of the borrower and the borrower's ability to repay and all loans must be adequately secured, as determined by RUS.
(3) Borrowers will be required to execute new legal documents, including a new note, loan contract, and security documents as necessary.
(4) Refinancing loans made under this section will generally be considered categorical exclusions for the purpose of environmental reviews because environmental reviews have previously been completed for the FFB loans or RUS loans being refinanced.
(h)
New loan terms.
(1) Interest on advances made on loans made under this section will be at the interest rate available on the date of the advance for the new loan used to refinance the prior outstanding loan and any related premium, fee, or expense.
(2) An eligible entity must propose a maturity date for the new loan not to exceed the maturity prescribed by this section, a funding notice, or thirty-five (35) years, whichever is shortest.
(3) An eligible entity may be given the option of applying the proceeds of an advance made on the new loan to cover any applicable prepayment premium, fee, or other expense.
(4) If the prepayment premiums are to be financed by the new loan, the maximum principal amount of the note will be increased in an amount sufficient to cover such prepayment premiums in full.
(5) Provided such waiver is not inconsistent with applicable law or the terms and conditions of the notes previously issued to RUS or FFB, the Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive or modify the requirements set forth in this paragraph (h), if in the Administrator's judgment, it is necessary to implement the intent of the authorizing statute and is in the best financial interest of the Government.

# Subpart C—Loan Purposes and Basic Policies
§ 1710.100
General.
(a) RUS makes loans and loan guarantees to finance the construction of electric distribution, transmission, and generation facilities, including system improvements and replacements, and cybersecurity and grid security improvements, required to furnish and improve electric service in rural areas, and for demand side management, efficiency, and energy conservation programs, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems. In certain limited circumstances, and at the discretion of the Administrator, RUS may finance selected operating expenses of its borrowers. Loans made or guaranteed by the Administrator will be made in conformance with the RE Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
), and this chapter. The Administrator's decision to provide financing for selecting operating expenses may include, but is not limited to the following factors:
(1) The overall availability of funding compared to anticipated loan demand;
(2) The best interests of rural consumers;
(3) The protection of the Government's financial interest in existing loans and collateral; and
(4) Broader policy objectives, including directing benefits to disadvantaged communities, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and other priorities of the Secretary of Agriculture.
(b) RUS provides technical assistance to borrowers to aid the development or improvement of rural electric service and to protect RUS' loan security. Additional information is available at
https://rd.usda.gov/programs-services/electric-programs.
(c) Provided funds are available for such purpose, RUS may refinance, as provided in § 1710.53, RUS Electric Program loans made or guaranteed for the purpose of furnishing and improving electric service in rural areas, and for the purpose of assisting electric borrowers to implement demand side management, energy efficiency and conservation programs, on-grid and off-
grid renewable energy systems, and cybersecurity and grid security improvements.
[87 FR 74498, Dec. 6, 2022]
§ 1710.101
Types of eligible borrowers.
(a) RUS makes loans to corporations, States, Tribes, territories, and subdivisions and agencies thereof; municipalities; people's utility districts; and cooperative, nonprofit, limited-dividend, or mutual associations that provide or propose to provide:
(1) The retail electric service needs of rural areas, or
(2) The power supply needs of distribution borrowers under the terms of power supply arrangement satisfactory to RUS, or
(3) Eligible purposes under the Rural Energy Savings Program, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy storage or energy conservation measures and related services, improvements, investments, financing or relending.
(b) In making loans, RUS gives preference to States, Tribes, territories, and subdivisions and agencies thereof; municipalities; people's utility districts; and cooperative, nonprofit, or limited-dividend associations. RUS does not make direct loans to individual consumers.
(c) For the purpose of determining eligibility of a distribution borrower not in default on the repayment of a loan made or guaranteed under the RE Act for a loan, loan guarantee, or lien accommodation, a default by a borrower from which a distribution borrower purchases wholesale power shall not:
(1) Be considered a default by the distribution borrower;
(2) Reduce the eligibility of the distribution borrower for assistance under the RE Act; or
(3) Be the cause, directly or indirectly, of imposing any requirement or restriction on the borrower as a condition of the assistance, except such requirements or restrictions as are necessary to implement a debt restructuring agreed on by the power supply borrower and RUS.
(d) For the purpose of determining the eligibility of a distribution borrower, RUS will consider whether the distribution borrower is current on its obligations to its wholesale power supplier under the RUS wholesale power contract.
(e) Nothing in paragraph (c) of this section relieves any distribution borrower that is a member of a power supply borrower in default on its obligations to RUS or operating under a debt restructuring agreement, of requirements set forth in RUS regulations, including, without limitation, § 1710.112(b)(6), or of any terms and conditions that the Administrator may otherwise impose on any borrower as a condition of obtaining a loan or loan guarantee (including, in appropriate cases, member guarantees).
(f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, former borrowers that have paid off all outstanding loans may reapply for a loan to serve RE Act beneficiary loads accruing from the time the former borrower's complete loan application is received by RUS. The determination of whether an area is rural will be based on the Census designation of the area at the time of the reapplication for a loan, if the area is not served by electric facilities financed by RUS. If the area is served by electric facilities financed by RUS, it will continue to be considered rural.
(g) Former borrowers that have prepaid all, or portions of outstanding insured and direct loans in accordance with RUS regulations must comply with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1786 before being considered eligible to borrow additional funds from RUS.
[58 FR 66264, Dec. 20, 1993, as amended at 78 FR 73365, Dec. 5, 2013; 85 FR 18418, Apr. 2, 2020; 87 FR 73436, Nov. 30, 2022]
§ 1710.102
Borrower eligibility for different types of loans.
(a)
Insured loans under section 305.
Insured loans are normally reserved for the financing of distribution and subtransmission facilities of both distribution and power supply borrowers, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems. In accordance with § 1710.110, the
Administrator may require the borrower to obtain no more than 30 percent of the total debt financing required for a proposed project by means of a supplemental loan from another lender without an RUS guarantee.
(b)
Direct loans under section 4.
Direct loans are normally reserved for the financing of distribution and subtransmission facilities of both distribution and power supply borrowers, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems.
(c)
One hundred percent loan guarantees under section 306.
Both distribution and power supply borrowers are eligible for 100 percent loan guarantees under section 306 of the RE Act for any or all of the purposes set forth in § 1710.106, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems. (See 7 CFR part 1712). These guarantees are normally used to finance bulk transmission and generation facilities, but they may also be used to finance distribution and subtransmission facilities. If a borrower applies for a section 306 loan guarantee to finance all or a portion of distribution and subtransmission facilities, such request will not affect the borrower's eligibility for an insured loan to finance any remaining portion of said facilities or for any future insured loan to finance other distribution or subtransmission facilities. A section 306 loan guarantee, however, may not be used to guarantee a supplemental loan required by § 1710.110.
(d)
One hundred percent loan guarantees under section 306A.
Under section 306A of the RE Act, both distribution and power supply borrowers are eligible under certain conditions to use an existing section 306 guarantee to refinance advances made on or before July 2, 1986 from a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank. (See 7 CFR part 1786.)
(e)
Ninety percent guarantees of private-sector loans under section 311.
Under section 311 of the RE Act, both distribution and power supply borrowers in the state of Alaska are eligible under certain conditions to obtain from RUS a 90 percent guarantee of a private-sector loan to refinance their Federal Financing Bank loans. (See 7 CFR part 1786.)

§ 1710.103
Area coverage.
(a) Borrowers shall make a diligent effort to extend electric service to all unserved persons within their service area who:
(1) Desire electric service; and
(2) Meet all reasonable requirements established by the borrower as a condition of service.
(b) If economically feasible and reasonable considering the cost of providing such service and/or the effects on all consumers' rates, such service shall be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, at the rates and minimum charges established in the borrower's rate schedules, without the payment by such persons, other than seasonal or temporary consumers, of a contribution in aid of construction. A seasonal consumer is one that demands electric service only during certain seasons of the year. A temporary consumer is a seasonal or year-round consumer that demands electric service over a period of less than five years.
(c) Borrowers may assess contributions in aid of construction provided such assessments are consistent with the policy set forth in this section.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 67404, Dec. 29, 1995]
§ 1710.104
Service to non-RE Act beneficiaries.
(a) To the greatest extent practical, loans are limited to providing and improving electric facilities to serve consumers that are RE Act beneficiaries. When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in order to furnish or improve electric service in rural areas, loans may, under certain circumstances, be made to finance electric facilities to serve consumers that are not RE Act beneficiaries.
(b) Loan funds may be approved for facilities to serve non-RE Act beneficiaries only if:
(1) The primary purpose of the loan is to furnish or improve service for RE Act beneficiaries; and
(2) The use of loan funds to serve non-RE Act beneficiaries is necessary and incidental to the primary purpose of the loan.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992; 57 FR 4513, Feb. 5, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 66264, Dec. 20, 1993]
§ 1710.105
State and Tribal regulatory approvals.
(a) In States or in Tribal areas where a borrower is required to obtain approval of a project or its financing from a State or Tribal regulatory authority, RUS requires that such approvals be obtained before the following types of loans are approved by RUS:
(1) Loans requiring an Environmental Impact Statement;
(2) Loans to finance generation and transmission facilities, when the loan request for such facilities is $25 million or more; and
(3) Loans for the purpose of assisting borrowers to implement demand side management and energy conservation programs and on and off grid renewable energy systems.
(b) In Tribal areas all borrowers are required to obtain approval of the project from the Tribal government or relevant Tribal regulatory body, before any loan is approved by RUS.
(c) At minimum, in the case of all loans in States or Tribal areas where State regulatory approval is required of the project or its financing, such State or Tribal approvals will be required before loan funds are advanced.
(d) In cases where State regulatory authority or Tribal government or relevant Tribal regulatory body approval has been obtained, but the borrower has failed to proceed with the project in a timely manner according to the schedule contained in the borrower's project design manual, or if there are cost overruns or other developments that threaten loan feasibility or security, RUS may require the borrower to obtain a reaffirmation of the project and its financing from the State or Tribal authority before any additional loan funds are advanced.
[87 FR 73436, Nov. 30, 2022]
§ 1710.106
Uses of loan funds.
(a) Funds from loans made or guaranteed by RUS may be used to finance:

The purchase, installation, improvements, and investments in assets needed for a robust smart grid infrastructure capability that enables the utility to operate efficiently, improve its reliability, and enhance its ability to recover from disasters, physical or cyber-attacks, carry out energy efficiency and demand side management activities, and implement renewable energy technologies and cybersecurity and grid security strategies.
(i) Smart grid, grid security, or cybersecurity infrastructure financed under this section must relate to one or more electric utility or energy efficiency purpose. Loan proceeds under this section may not be used to solely finance retail broadband services.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, a borrower is permitted to use up to 10 percent of the amount provided under this subpart to construct, improve, or acquire broadband infrastructure related to the project financed, subject to the requirements of 7 CFR part 1980, subpart M.
(b) In cases of financial hardship, as determined by the Administrator, loans may also be made to finance the following items:
(1) General plant equipment, including furniture, office, transportation, data processing and other work equipment; and
(2) Working capital required for the initial operation of a new system.
(c) RUS will not make loans to finance the following:
(1) Electric facilities, equipment, appliances, or wiring located inside the premises of the consumer, except for measures related to grid security, cybersecurity, or assets financed pursuant to an eligible EE Program, and qualifying items included in a loan for demand side management or energy resource conservation programs, or renewable energy systems.
(2) Facilities to serve consumers who are not RE Act beneficiaries unless those facilities are necessary and incidental to providing or improving electric service in rural areas (
See §
1710.104).
(3) Any facilities or other purposes that a State regulatory authority having jurisdiction will not approve for inclusion in the borrower's rate base or will not otherwise allow rates sufficient to repay with interest the debt incurred for the facilities or other purposes.
(d) A distribution borrower may request a loan period of up to 4 years. Except in the case of loans for new generating and associated transmission facilities, a power supply borrower may request a loan period of not more than 4 years for transmission and substation facilities and improvements or replacements of generation facilities. The loan period for new generating facilities and DSM activities will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Administrator may approve a loan period shorter than the period requested by the borrower, if in the Administrator's sole discretion, a loan made for the longer period would fail to meet RUS requirements for loan feasibility and loan security set forth in §§ 1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively.
(e)(1) If, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the amount authorized for lending for municipal rate loans, hardship rate loans, and loan guarantees in a fiscal year is substantially less than the total amount eligible for RUS financing, RUS may limit the size, type, or purpose of loans approved during the fiscal year. Depending on the amount of the shortfall between the amount authorized for lending and the loan application inventory on hand for each type of loan, RUS may either reduce the amount on an equal proportion basis for all applicants for that type of loan based on the amount of funds for which the applicant is eligible or may shorten the loan period for which funding will be approved to less than the maximum of 4 years. All applications for the same type of loan approved during a fiscal year will be treated in the same manner, except that RUS will not limit funding to any borrower requesting a RUS loan or loan guarantee of $1 million or less. Should a shortfall or urgent need related to cybersecurity, grid security, or statutory preference become evident
during a fiscal year, the Administrator may announce priorities in a public notice for utilizing available funds for the balance of the fiscal year.
(2) If RUS limits the amount of loan funds approved for borrowers, the Administrator shall provide public notice to all electric borrowers as early as possible in the fiscal year of the manner in which funding will be limited. The portion of the loan application that is not funded during that fiscal year may, at the borrower's option, be treated as a second loan application received by RUS at a later date. This date will be determined by RUS in the same manner for all affected loans and will be based on the availability of loan funds. The second loan application shall be considered complete except that the borrower must submit a certification from a duly authorized corporate official stating that funds are still needed for loan purposes specified in the original application and must notify RUS of any changes in its circumstances that materially affects the information contained in the original loan application or the primary support documents. See § 1710.401(f).
(f)(1) For borrowers having one or more loans approved on or after October 1, 1991, advances of funds will be made only for the primary budget purposes included in the loan as shown on RUS Form 740c as amended and approved by RUS, or on a construction work plan or a construction work plan amendment approved by RUS. Each advance will be charged to the oldest outstanding note(s) having unadvanced funds for the primary budget purpose for which the request for advances was made, regardless of whether such notes are associated with loans approved before or after October 1, 1991, unless any conditions on advances under any of these notes have not been met by the borrower.
(2) For borrowers whose most recent loan was approved before October 1, 1991, advances will be made on the oldest outstanding note having unadvanced funds, unless any conditions on advances under such note have not been met by the borrower.
(g) A borrower is permitted to use up to 10 percent of the amount provided under this part to construct, improve, or acquire broadband infrastructure related to the project financed, subject to the requirements of 7 CFR part 1980, subpart M.

§ 1710.107
Amount lent for acquisitions.
The maximum amount that will be lent for an acquisition is limited to the value of the property, as determined by RUS. If the acquisition price exceeds this amount, the borrower shall provide the remainder without RUS financial assistance.
§ 1710.108
Mergers and consolidations.
(a) RUS encourages its borrowers to consider merging or consolidating with another electric borrower when such action will contribute to greater operating efficiency and financial soundness.
(b) After a merger or consolidation, RUS will give priority consideration per § 1710.119 to the processing of loans for the surviving system to finance the integration and rehabilitation of electric facilities, if necessary, and the improvement or extension of electric service in rural areas. Such priority consideration will also be given in the case of a borrower that has merged or consolidated with an electric system that has not previously received RUS financial assistance, if such system was serving primarily rural residents at the time of the merger or consolidation and such rural residents will continue to be served by the merged or consolidated system. RUS does not make loans for costs incurred in effectuating mergers or consolidations, such as legal expenses or feasibility study costs.
§ 1710.109
Reimbursement of general funds and interim financing.
(a) Borrowers may request that a loan include funds to reimburse general funds and/or replace interim financing used to finance equipment and facilities that were included in an RUS-approved construction work plan, energy
efficiency and conservation program work plan, work plan amendment or other RUS-approved plan, and for which loan funds have not been provided by RUS. Such reimbursement and/or replacement of interim financing may include the direct costs of procurement and construction, as well as the related cost of engineering, architectural, environmental and other studies and plans needed to support the project, when such cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the facilities.
(b) If procurement and/or construction of the equipment and facilities was completed prior to the current loan period, reimbursement, including replacement of interim financing, will be limited, except in cases of extreme financial hardship as determined by the Administrator, to the cost of procurement and construction completed during the period immediately preceding the current loan period, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. As defined in § 1710.2, the loan period begins on the date shown on page 1 of RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers.
(c) The period immediately preceding the current loan period for which reimbursement and replacement of interim financing is authorized under paragraph (b) of this section is 48 months. Policies for reimbursement of general funds and interim financing following certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of systems substantially in their entirety are set forth in 7 CFR 1717.154.
(d) If the reimbursement of general funds and/or replacement of interim financing is for approved expenditures for equipment and facilities whose procurement and/or construction is completed during the current loan period, the time limits of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 66265, Dec. 20, 1993; 61 FR 66870, Dec. 19, 1996; 78 FR 73366, Dec. 5, 2013; 86 FR 36196, July 9, 2021]
§ 1710.110
Supplemental financing.
(a) Except in the case of financial hardship as determined by the Administrator, and following certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of systems substantially in their entirety as set forth in 7 CFR 1717.154, applicants for a municipal rate loan will be required to obtain a portion of their loan funds from a supplemental source without an RUS guarantee, in the amounts set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. RUS will normally grant a lien accommodation to the supplemental lender. RUS does not require supplemental financing in conjunction with an RUS guaranteed loan. However, if a borrower elects to obtain supplemental financing in conjunction with a guaranteed loan, the granting of RUS's loan guarantee may be conditioned on the borrower's obtaining supplemental financing.
(b) The terms and conditions of supplemental financing and any security offered to the supplemental lender are subject to RUS approval. Generally, supplemental loans must have the same final maturity and be amortized in the same manner as RUS loans made concurrently. Borrowers may elect to repay the loans either in substantially equal periodic installments covering interest and principal, or in periodic installments that include interest and level amortization of principal.
(c)
Supplemental financing required for municipal rate loans
—(1)
Distribution borrowers.
(i) Distribution borrowers that had, as of December 31, 1980, an average consumer density of 2 or fewer consumers per mile or an average adjusted plant revenue ratio (APRR), as defined in § 1710.2, of over 9.0 shall obtain supplemental financing equal to 10 percent of their loan request.
(ii) All other distribution borrowers must obtain supplemental financing according to their plant revenue ratio (PRR), as defined in § 1710.2, based on the most recent year-end data available on the date of loan approval, as follows:
PRR
Supplemental loan percentage
9.00 and above
10
8.01-8.99
20
8.00 and below
30
(iii) If a distribution borrower enters into a merger, consolidation, or transfer of system substantially in its entirety, and the provisions of 7 CFR 1717.154(b) do not apply, required supplemental financing will be determined
as follows for loans approved by RUS after December 19, 1996. If one of the merging parties met the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section prior to the effective date of the merger consolidation or transfer, the borrower will be required to obtain supplemental financing equal to 10 percent of any loan funds requested for facilities to serve consumers located in the territory formerly served by the “paragraph (c)(1)(i)” borrower. The required amount of supplemental financing for the rest of the loan will be determined according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Power supply borrowers.
The supplemental loan proportion required of a power supply borrower is based on the simple arithmetic mean of the supplemental loan proportions required of the borrower's distribution members.
(3)
Subsequent loans.
(i) If more than 5 percent of an insured loan made prior to November 1, 1993, or of a municipal rate loan is terminated or rescinded, the amount of supplemental financing required in the borrower's next loan after the rescission for which supplemental financing is required, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, will be adjusted to average the actual supplemental financing portion on the terminated or rescinded loan with the supplemental financing portion that would have been required on the new loan according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, in accordance with the formulas set forth in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii) If a borrower's supplemental financing requirement as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section has not changed between the most recent loan and the loan being considered, then the amount of supplemental financing required for the new loan will be computed as follows:
Supplemental financing amount, new loan = [(A + B) × C] − D
where:
A = The total funds ($) actually advanced from the first loan, including both RUS loan funds and funds from the supplemental loan, plus any unadvanced funds still available to the borrower after the rescission.
B = The total amount ($) for facilities of the new loan request, including both RUS loan funds and funds from supplemental loans.
C = The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the loans according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
D = The amount ($) of supplemental funds actually advanced on the first loan, plus any unadvanced supplemental funds still available to the borrower after the rescission.
(iii) If a borrower's supplemental financing requirement as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section has changed between the most recent loan and the loan being considered, then the amount of supplemental financing required for the new loan will be the weighted average of the portions otherwise applicable on the two loans and will be computed as follows:
Supplemental financing amount, new loan = (A × C
1
) + (B × C
2
)−D
where:
A = The total funds ($) actually advanced from the first loan, including both RUS loan funds and funds from the supplemental loan, plus any unadvanced funds still available to the borrower after the rescission.
B = The total amount ($) for facilities of the new loan request, including both RUS funds and funds from supplemental loans.
C
1
= The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the old loan according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
C
2
= The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the new loan according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
D = The amount ($) of supplemental funds actually advanced on the first loan, plus any unadvanced supplemental funds still available to the borrower after the rescission.
(d) Supplemental financing will not be required in connection with hardship rate loans. Borrowers that qualify for hardship rate loans but elect to take municipal rate loans instead, will be required to obtain supplemental financing pursuant to this section, unless at the time of loan approval, there are no funds remaining available for hardship loans, in which case supplemental financing will not be required.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 66265, Dec. 20, 1993; 60 FR 3730, Jan. 19, 1995; 61 FR 66870, Dec. 19, 1996]
§ 1710.111
Refinancing.
(a) RUS makes loans or loan guarantees to refinance the outstanding indebtedness of borrowers in the following cases:
(1) Loans or loan guarantees to refinance long-term debt owed by borrowers to the Tennessee Valley Authority for credit extended under the terms of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended.
(2) Loan guarantees made in accordance with the provisions of section 306A of the RE Act to prepay a loan (or any loan advance thereunder) made by the Federal Financing Bank.
(b) In certain circumstances, RUS may make a loan to replace interim financing obtained for the construction of facilities (See § 1710.109).
§ 1710.112
Loan feasibility.
(a) RUS will make a loan only if there is reasonable assurance that the loan, together with all outstanding loans and other obligations of the borrower, will be repaid in full as scheduled, in accordance with the mortgage, notes, and loan contracts. The borrower must provide evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that the loan will be repaid in full as scheduled, and that all other obligations of the borrower will be met.
(b) Based on evidence submitted by the borrower and other information, RUS will use the following criteria to evaluate loan feasibility:
(1) Projections of power requirements, rates, revenues, expenses, margins, and other factors for the present system and proposed additions are based on reasonable assumptions and adequate supporting data and analysis, including analysis of a range of assumptions for the significant variables, when required by § 1710.300(d)(5).
(2) Projected revenues from the rates proposed by the borrower are adequate to meet the required TIER and DSC ratios based on the borrower's total costs, including the projected maximum debt service cost of the new loan.
(3) The economics of the borrower's operations and service area are such that consumers can reasonably be expected to pay the proposed rates required to cover all expenses and meet RUS TIER and DSC requirements, and the borrower can reasonably compete with other utilities and other energy sources to prevent substantial load loss while providing satisfactory service to its consumers.
(4) Risks of possible loss of substantial loads from large consumers or from load concentrations in particular industries will not substantially impair loan feasibility.
(5) Risks of loss of portions of the borrower's service territory from annexation or other causes will not substantially impair loan feasibility. If there appears to be a substantial risk, RUS may require additional information from the borrower, such as a summary and analysis of the risk by the borrower; state, county or local planning reports having information on projected growth or expansion plans of local communities; annexation plans of the municipalities in question; and any other relevant information.
(6) In states where rates or investment decisions are subject to approval by state regulatory authorities, there is reasonable expectation that such approvals will be forthcoming to enable repayment of the loan in full according to its terms.
(7) The experience and performance of the system's management is acceptable.
(8) In the case of joint ventures, the borrower has sufficient management control or other contractual safeguards with respect to the construction and operation of the jointly owned facility to ensure that the borrower's interests are protected and the credit risk is minimized.
(9) The borrower has implemented adequate financial and management controls and there are and have been no significant financial or other irregularities.
(10) The borrower's projected capitalization, measured by its equity as a percentage of total assets, is adequate to enable the borrower to meet its financial needs and to provide service consistent with the RE Act. Among the factors to be considered in reviewing the borrower's projected capitalization are the economic strength of the borrower's service territory, the inherent cost of providing service to the territory, the disparity in rates between the
borrower and neighboring utilities, the intensity of competition faced by the borrower from neighboring utilities and other power sources, and the relative amount of new capital investment required to serve existing or new loads.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992; 57 FR 4513, Feb. 5, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 3731, Jan. 19, 1995; 63 FR 51793, Sept. 29, 1998; 84 FR 32610, July 9, 2019]
§ 1710.113
Loan security.
(a) RUS makes loans only if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the security therefor is reasonably adequate and the loan will be repaid according to its terms within the time agreed.
(b) RUS generally requires that borrowers provide it with a first lien on all of the borrower's real and personal property, including intangible personal property and any property acquired after the date of the loan. This lien shall be in the form of a mortgage by the borrower to the Government or a deed of trust between the borrower and a trustee satisfactory to the Administrator, together with such security documents as RUS may deem necessary in a particular case.
(c)(1) When a borrower is unable by reason of preexisting encumbrances, or otherwise, to furnish a first mortgage lien on its entire system the Administrator may accept other forms of security, such as a pledge of revenues, if he or she determines such security is reasonably adequate and the form and nature thereof is otherwise acceptable.
(2) The Administrator, at his or her discretion, may approve the use of an indenture patterned after those indentures commonly used by utilities engaged in private market financing, in lieu of a mortgage as the security instrument for loans to power supply borrowers. The use of an indenture will be by mutual agreement of the borrower and the Administrator. The terms of each indenture and related loan agreement will be negotiated on a case by case basis to best meet the needs of the individual borrower and the Government. The provisions of the indenture and loan contract shall control, notwithstanding any provisions of 7 CFR Chapter XVII which may be in conflict therewith.
(d) In the case of loans that include the financing of electric facilities that are operated as an integral component of a non-RUS financed system (such as generation and transmission facilities co-owned with other electric utilities), the borrower shall, in addition to the mortgage lien on all of the borrower's electric facilities, furnish adequate assurance, in the form of contractual or other security arrangements, that the system will be operated on an efficient and continuous basis. Satisfactory evidence must also be provided that the non-RUS financed system is financially sound and under capable management. Examples of such evidence include financial reports, annual reports, Security and Exchange Commission 10K reports if the system is required to file them, credit reports from Standard and Poor's, Moodys or other recognized sources, reports to state regulatory authorities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and evidence of a successful track record in related construction projects.
(e) Additional controls on the borrower's financial, investment and managerial activities appear in the loan contract and mortgage required by RUS.
[57 FR 1053, Jan. 9, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 7665, Feb. 20, 1997]
§ 1710.114
TIER, DSC, OTIER and ODSC requirements.
(a)
General.
Requirements for coverage ratios are set forth in the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other contractual agreements with RUS. Nothing in this section, however, shall limit the Administrator's ability to contractually agree to a different ratio provided in this section when doing so would advance or protect the interests of the government.
(b)
Coverage ratios.
(1) The minimum coverage ratios required of distribution borrowers whether applied on an annual or average basis of the 2 best years out of the 3 most recent calendar years, are a TIER of 1.25, DSC of 1.25. Further, the minimum coverage ratios required of distribution borrowers whether applied on an annual or average basis of the 2 best years out of the 3 most recent calendar years are an
OTIER and ODSC of 1.1 or an MTIER and MDSC of 1.1.
(2) The minimum coverage ratios required of power supply borrowers, whether applied on an annual or average basis, are a TIER of 1.05 and DSC of 1.00.
(3) When new loan contracts are executed, the Administrator may, case by case, increase the coverage ratios of distribution and power supply borrowers above the levels cited in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, of this section if the Administrator determines that the higher ratios are required to ensure reasonable security for and/or the repayment of loans made or guaranteed by RUS. Also, the Administrator may, case by case, reduce said coverage ratios if the Administrator determines that the lower ratios are required to ensure reasonable security for and/or the repayment of loans made or guaranteed by RUS. Policies for coverage ratios following certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of systems substantially in their entirety are in 7 CFR 1717.155.
(4) If a distribution borrower has in service or under construction a substantial amount of generation and associated transmission plant financed at a cost of capital substantially higher than the cost of funds under section 305 of the RE Act, then the Administrator may establish, in his or her sole discretion, blended levels for TIER, DSC, OTIER, and ODSC based on the respective shares of total utility plant represented by said generation and associated transmission plant and by distribution and other transmission plant.
(c)
Requirements for loan feasibility.
To be eligible for a loan, borrowers must demonstrate to RUS that they will, on a pro forma basis, earn the coverage ratios required by paragraph (b) of this section in each of the years included in the borrower's long-range financial forecast prepared in support of its loan application, as set forth in subpart G of this part.
(d)
Requirements for maintenance of coverage ratios
—(1)
Prospective requirement.
Borrowers must design and implement rates for utility service to provide sufficient revenue (along with other revenue available to the borrower in the case of TIER and DSC) to pay all fixed and variable expenses, to provide and maintain reasonable working capital and to maintain on an annual basis the coverage ratios required by paragraph (b) of this section. Rates must be designed and implemented to produce at least enough revenue to meet the requirements of this paragraph under the assumption that average weather conditions in the borrower's service territory will prevail in the future, including average system damage and outages due to weather and the related costs. Failure to design and implement rates pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph shall be an event of default upon notice provided in accordance with the terms of the borrower's mortgage or loan contract.
(2)
Retrospective requirement.
The average coverage ratios achieved by a borrower in the 2 best years out of the 3 most recent calendar years must meet the levels required by paragraph (b) of this section. If a borrower fails to achieve these average levels, it must promptly notify RUS in writing. Within 30 days of such notification or of the borrower being notified in writing by RUS, whichever is earlier, the borrower, in consultation with RUS, must provide a written plan satisfactory to RUS setting forth the actions that will be taken to achieve the required coverage ratios on a timely basis. Failure to develop and implement a plan satisfactory to RUS shall be an event of default upon notice provided in accordance with the terms of the borrower's mortgage or loan contract.
(3)
Fixed and variable expenses,
as used in this section, include but are not limited to: all taxes, depreciation, maintenance expenses, and the cost of electric power and energy and other operating expenses of the electric system, including all obligations under the wholesale power contract, all lease payments when due, and all principal and interest payments on outstanding indebtedness when due.
(e)
Requirements for advance of funds.
(1) If a borrower applying for a loan has failed to achieve the coverage ratios required by paragraph (b) of this section during the latest 12 month period immediately preceding approval of the
loan, or if any of the borrower's average coverage ratios for the 2 best years out of the most recent 3 calendar years were below the levels required in paragraph (b) of this section, RUS may withhold the advance of loan funds until the borrower has adopted an annual financial plan and operating budget satisfactory to RUS and taken such other action as RUS may require to demonstrate that the required coverage ratios will be maintained in the future and that the loan will be repaid with interest within the time agreed. Such other action may include, for example, increasing system operating efficiency and reducing costs or adopting a rate design that will achieve the required coverage ratios, and either placing such rates into effect or taking action to obtain regulatory authority approval of such rates. If failure to achieve the coverage ratios is due to unusual events beyond the control of the borrower, such as unusual weather, system outage due to a storm or regulatory delay in approving rate increases, then the Administrator may waive the requirement that the borrower take the remedial actions set forth in this paragraph, provided that such waiver will not threaten loan feasibility.
(2) With respect to any outstanding loan approved by RUS if, based on actual or projected financial performance of the borrower, RUS determines that the borrower may not achieve its required coverage ratios in the current or future years, RUS may withhold the advance of loan funds until the borrower has taken remedial action satisfactory to RUS.
[60 FR 67404, Dec. 29, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 66871, Dec. 19, 1996; 65 FR 51748, Aug. 25, 2000; 88 FR 12810, Mar. 1, 2023]
§ 1710.115
Final maturity.
(a) RUS is authorized to make loans and loan guarantees with a final maturity of up to 35 years. The borrower may elect a repayment period for a loan not longer than the expected useful life of the facilities, not to exceed 35 years. Most of the electric facilities financed by RUS have a long useful life, often approximating 35 years. Some facilities, such as load management equipment and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition equipment, have a much shorter useful life due, in part, to obsolescence. Operating loans to finance working capital required for the initial operation of a new system are a separate class of loans and usually have a final maturity of less than 10 years.
(b) Loans made or guaranteed by RUS for facilities owned by the borrower generally must be repaid with interest within a period, up to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The expected useful life shall be based on the weighted average of the useful lives that the borrower proposes for the facilities financed by the loan, provided that the proposed useful lives are deemed appropriate by RUS. RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application must include, as a note, either a statement certifying that at least 90 percent of the loan funds are for facilities that have a useful life of 33 years or longer, or a schedule showing the costs and useful life of those facilities with a useful life of less than 33 years. If the useful life determination proposed by the borrower is not deemed appropriate by RUS, RUS will base expected useful life on an independent evaluation, the manufacturer's estimated useful-life or RUS experience with like-property, as applicable. Final maturities for loans for the implementation of programs for demand side management and energy resource conservation and on and off grid renewable energy sources not owned by the borrower will be determined by RUS. Due to the uncertainty of predictions over an extended period of time, RUS may add up to 2 years to the composite average useful life of the facilities in order to determine final maturity.
(c) The term for loans made to finance Eligible EE Programs will be determined in accordance with § 1710.408 of this part.
(d) The Administrator may approve a repayment period longer than the expected useful life of the facilities financed, up to 35 years, if a longer final maturity is required to ensure repayment of the loan and loan security is adequate.
(e) The final maturity of a loan established pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be extended as a result of extending loan payments under section 12(a) of the RE Act.

Loan processing priorities.
(a) Generally loans are processed in chronological order based on the date the complete application is received in the Regional office.
(b) The Administrator may give priority to processing loans that are required to meet the following needs:
(1) To restore electric service following a major storm or other catastrophe;
(2) To bring existing electric facilities into compliance with any environmental requirements imposed by Federal or state law that were not in effect at the time the facilities were originally constructed;
(3) To finance the capital needs of borrowers that are the result of a merger, consolidation, or a transfer of a system substantially in its entirety, provided that the merger, consolidation, or transfer has either been approved by RUS or does not need RUS approval pursuant to the borrower's loan documents (See 7 CFR 1717.154); or
(4) To correct serious safety problems, other than those resulting from borrower mismanagement or negligence.
(c) The Administrator may also change the normal order of processing loan applications when it is necessary to ensure that all loan authority for the fiscal year is utilized.

Computer-generated forms or electronic submissions of data are acceptable. Graphs, tables, spreadsheets or other exhibits shall be included throughout the forecast as appropriate.
(8) A narrative discussing the coordination activities conducted between a power supply borrower and its members, as applicable, and between the borrower and RUS.
(9) Borrowers with a residential demand of 50 percent or more of total kWh should include in the Load Forecast a Residential Consumer Survey that is performed at least every 5 years to obtain data on appliance and equipment saturation and electricity demand. Any such borrower that is experiencing or anticipates changes in usage patterns shall consider surveys on a more frequent schedule. Power supply borrowers shall coordinate such surveys with their members.
(10) Residential consumer surveys may be based on the aggregation of member-based samples or on a system-wide sample, provided that the latter provides relevant regional breakdowns as appropriate.
(11) A load forecast for a power supply borrower and its members must cover all member systems, including those that are not borrowers. Each borrower is individually responsible for forecasting all its RE Act beneficiary and non-RE Act beneficiary loads.
(12) A narrative description of the borrower's load forecast including future load projections, forecast assumptions, and the methods and procedures used to develop the forecast.
(13) Projections of usage by consumer class, number of consumers by class, annual system peak demand, and season of peak demand for the number of years agreed upon by RUS and the borrower.
(14) A summary of the year-by-year results of the load forecast in a format that allows efficient transfer of the information to other borrower planning or loan support documents.

# Subpart F—Construction Work Plans and Related Studies
§ 1710.250
General.
(a) An ongoing, integrated planning system is needed by borrowers to determine their short-term and long-term needs for plant additions, improvements, replacements, and retirements. The primary components of the system consist of long-range engineering plans, construction work plans (CWPs), CWP amendments, and special engineering and cost studies. Long range engineering plans identify plant investments required over a period of 10-20 years or more. CWPs specify and document plant requirements for the short-term, usually 4 years, and special engineering and cost studies are used to support CWPs and to identify and document requirements for specific items or purposes, such as load management equipment, System Control and Data Acquisition equipment, sectionalizing investments, and additions of generation capacity and associated transmission plant.
(b) A long range engineering plan specifies and supports the major system additions, improvements, replacements, and retirements needed for an orderly transition from the existing system to the system required 10 or more years in the future. The planned future system should be based on the most technically and economically sound means of serving the borrower's long-range loads in a reliable and environmentally acceptable manner, and it
should ensure that planned facilities will not become obsolete prematurely.
(c) A CWP shall include investment cost estimates and supporting engineering and cost studies to demonstrate the need for each proposed facility or activity and the reasonableness of the investment projections and the engineering assumptions used in sizing the facilities. The CWP must be consistent with the borrower's long range engineering plan and both documents must be consistent with the borrower's RUS-approved power requirements study.
(d) Applications for a loan or loan guarantee from RUS (new loans or budget reclassifications) must be supported by a current CWP approved by RUS. RUS approval of these plans relates only to the facilities, equipment, and other purposes to be financed by RUS, and means that the plans provide an adequate basis from a planning and engineering standpoint to support RUS financing. RUS approval of the plans does not mean that RUS approves of the facilities, equipment, or other purposes for which the borrower is not seeking RUS financing. If RUS disagrees with a borrower's estimate of the cost of one or more facilities for which RUS financing is sought, RUS may adjust the estimate after consulting with the borrower and explaining the reasons for the adjustment.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, to be eligible for RUS financing, the facilities, including equipment and other items, included in a CWP must be approved by RUS and receive Environmental Clearance before the start of construction. This requirement also applies to any amendments to a CWP required to add facilities to a CWP or to make significant physical changes in the facilities already included in a CWP. Provision for funding of “minor projects” under an RUS loan guarantee is permitted on the same basis as that discussed for insured loan funds in 7 CFR part 1721, Post-Loan Policies and Procedures for Insured Electric Loans.
(f) In the case of damage caused by storms, natural catastrophes, sabotage, willful attacks, accidents, or acts of force majeure, a borrower may proceed with emergency repair work before a CWP or CWP amendment is prepared by the borrower and approved by RUS, without losing eligibility for RUS financing of the repairs. The borrower must notify RUS in writing after the incident, of its preliminary estimates of damages and repair costs. Not later than 120 days after the incident, the borrower must submit to RUS for approval, a CWP or CWP amendment detailing the repairs.
(g) A CWP may be amended or augmented when the borrower can demonstrate the need for the changes.
(h) A borrower's CWP or special engineering studies must be supported by the appropriate level of environmental review documentation, in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.
(i) All engineering activities required by this subpart must be performed by qualified engineers, who may be staff employees of the borrower or outside consultants. All engineering services must be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer.
(j) Upon written request from a borrower, RUS may waive in writing certain requirements with respect to long-range engineering plans and CWPs if RUS determines that such requirements impose a substantial burden on the borrower and that waiving the requirements will not significantly affect the accomplishment of the objectives of this subpart. For example, if a borrower's load is forecast to remain constant or decline during the planning period, RUS may waive those portions of the plans that relate to load growth.
[84 FR 32611, July 9, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 17274, Mar. 11, 2024]
§ 1710.251
Construction work plans—distribution borrowers.
(a) All distribution borrowers must maintain a current CWP covering all new construction, improvements, replacements, and retirements of distribution and transmission plant, and improvements replacements, and retirements of any generation plant. Construction of new generation capacity need not be included in a CWP but must be specified and supported by specific engineering and cost studies. (See § 1710.253.)
(b) A distribution borrower's CWP shall typically cover a construction period of 4 years and includes all facilities to be constructed which are eligible for RUS financing, whether or not RUS financial assistance will be sought or be available for certain facilities. Any RUS financing provided for the facilities will be limited to a 4 year loan period. The construction period covered by a CWP in support of a loan application shall not be shorter than the loan period requested for financing of the facilities.
(c) The facilities, equipment and other items included in a distribution borrower's CWP may include:
(1) Line extensions required to connect consumers, improve service reliability or improve voltage conditions;
(2) Distribution tie lines to improve reliability of service and voltage regulation;
(3) Line conversions and changes required to improve existing services or provide additional capacity for new consumers;
(4) New substation facilities or additions to existing substations;

(b) A borrower must prepare, for RUS review and approval, a long-range financial forecast in support of its loan application. The forecast must demonstrate that the borrower's system is economically viable and that the proposed loan is financially feasible. Loan feasibility will be assessed based on the criteria set forth in § 1710.112.
(c) The financial forecast and related projections submitted in support of a loan application shall include:
(1) The projected results of future actions planned by the borrower's board of directors;
(2) The financial goals established for margins, TIER, DSC, equity, and levels of general funds to be invested in plant;
(3) A pro forma balance sheet, statement of operations, and general funds summary projected for each year during the forecast period;
(4) A full explanation of the assumptions, supporting data, and analysis used in the forecast, including the methodology used to project loads, rates, revenue, power costs, operating expenses, plant additions, and other factors having a material effect on the balance sheet and on financial ratios such as equity, TIER, and DSC;
(5) Current and projected cash flows;
(6) Projections of future borrowings and the associated interest and principal expenses required to meet the projected investment requirements of the system;
(7) Current and projected kW and kWh energy sales;
(8) Current and projected unit prices of significant variables such as retail and wholesale power prices, average labor costs, and interest;
(9) Current and projected system operating costs, including, but not limited to, wholesale power costs, depreciation expenses, labor costs, and debt service costs;
(10) Current and projected revenues from sales of electric power and energy;
(11) Current and projected non-operating income and expense;
(12) A discussion of the historical experience of the borrower, and in the case of a power supply borrower its member systems as appropriate, with respect to the borrower's market competitiveness as it relates to the rates charged for electricity, competition from other fuels, and other factors. Additional data and analysis may be required by RUS on a case by case basis to assess the probable future competitiveness of those borrowers that have a history of serious competitive problems; and
(13) An analysis of the effects of major factors, such as projected increases in rates charged for electricity, on the ability of the borrower, and in the case of a power supply borrower its member systems, to compete with neighboring utilities and other energy sources.
(d) The following plans, studies and assumptions shall be used in developing the financial forecast:
(1) The RUS-approved CWP;
(2) RUS-approved power requirements data;
(3) RUS-approved EE Program work plan;
(4) The current rate schedules or new rates;

(b) A power cost study shall include the following basic elements:
(1) A study of all reasonably available self-generation, purchased-power, load management, and energy conservation alternatives as set forth in §§ 1710.253 and 1710.254;
(2) A present-value analysis of the costs of the alternatives and their effects on total power costs, covering a period of at least 10 years beyond the projected in-service date of the facilities;
(3) A description of proposed new power-purchase contracts or revisions to existing contracts, and an analysis of the effects on power costs;
(4) Use of sensitivity analyses to determine the vulnerability of the alternatives to a reasonable range of assumptions about fuel costs, failure to achieve projected load growth, changes in operating and financing costs, and other major factors, if the financial forecast is used in support of a loan or loan guarantee that exceeds the smaller of $25 million or 10 percent of the borrower's total utility plant. Individual sensitivity analyses need not be duplicated if they have been included in other materials submitted to RUS; and
(5) Assessment of the financial risks of the various alternatives, especially as between capital-intensive and non-capital-intensive alternatives, under the range of assumptions set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(c) Power cost studies must use current, RUS-approved power requirements data, and all major assumptions are subject to RUS approval. Alternative assumptions about projected power requirements may be used, however, in conjunction with the sensitivity analyses required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

§ 1710.601
Advance of funds from loans.
The borrower shall request advances of funds as needed. Advances are subject to RUS approval and must be requested in writing on RUS Form 595 or an RUS approved equivalent form. Funds will not be advanced until the Administrator has received satisfactory evidence that the borrower has met all applicable conditions precedent to the advance of funds, including evidence that the supplemental financing required under this part concurrent loan guaranteed by RUS is available to the borrower under terms and conditions satisfactory to RUS.
§ 1710.602
Fund advance period.
(a) The fund advance period begins on the date of the loan note and will last no longer than five years, after September 30 of the fifth year after the fiscal year of obligation. The fiscal year of obligation is identified in loan documentation associated with each loan. The Administrator may extend the fund advance period on any loan if the borrower meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. However, under no circumstances shall RUS ever make or approve an advance, regardless of the last day for an advance on the loan note or any extension by the Administrator, later than September 30 of the fifth year after the fiscal year of obligation if such date would result in
the RUS obligating or permitting advance of funds contrary to the Anti-Deficiency Act.
(b) The Administrator may agree to an extension of the fund advance period for loans if the borrower demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the loan funds continue to be needed for approved loan purposes (
e.g.,
facilities included in a RUS approved construction work plan). Policies for extension of the fund advance period following certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of systems substantially in their entirety are set forth in 7 CFR 1717.156.
(1) To apply for an extension, the borrower must make a request to RUS prior to the last date for advance as noted in the borrower's loan documents and provide, the following:
(i) A certified copy of a board resolution requesting an extension of the Government's obligation to advance loan funds;
(ii) Evidence that the unadvanced loan funds continue to be needed for approved loan purposes; and
(iii) Notice of the estimated date for completion of construction.
(2) If the Administrator approves a request for an extension, RUS will notify the borrower in writing of the extension and the terms and conditions thereof. An extension will be effective only if it is requested in writing prior to the last date for advance as provided in the borrower's loan documents.
(3) Any request received after the last date for advance shall be rejected.
(c) RUS will rescind the balance of any loan funds not advanced to a borrower as of the final date approved for advancing funds.
§ 1710.603
Sequence of advances.
(a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, concurrent loan funds will be advanced in the following order:

(2) One hundred (100) percent of the supplemental loan funds.
(3) The remaining amount of the RUS insured loan funds.

§ 1710.604
Amortization of principal.
(a) Amortization of funds advanced during the first 2 years after the date of the note shall begin no later than 2 years from the date of the note. Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, amortization of funds advanced 2 years or more after the date of the note shall begin with the scheduled loan payment billed in the month following the month of the advance.
(b) For advances made 2 years or more after the date of the note, the Administrator may, upon written request from the borrower, authorize deferral of amortization of principal for a period of up to 2 years from the date of the advance if the Administrator determines that failure to authorize such deferral would adversely affect either the Government's financial interest or the achievement of the purposes of the Rural Electrification Act. Such deferral shall not extend the loan maturity period.
§ 1710.605
Rescission of loans.
(a) A borrower may request rescission of a loan with respect to any funds unadvanced by submitting a letter signed by the General Manager, Board President or other individual authorized by the Board of Directors to request such rescission.
(b) RUS may rescind loans pursuant to § 1710.602(c).
(c) Borrowers who prepay RUS loans at a discounted present value pursuant to subpart F of 7 CFR part 1786 are required to rescind the unadvanced balance of all outstanding electric notes pursuant to 7 CFR 1786.158(j).

§ 1714.2
Definitions.
The definitions set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2 are applicable to this part, unless otherwise stated. References to specific RUS forms and other RUS documents, and to specific sections of such forms and documents, shall include the corresponding forms, documents, sections and lines in any subsequent revisions of these forms and documents.
§ 1714.3
Applicability of provisions.
(a)
Insured electric loans approved on or after November 1, 1993.
On November 1, 1993, the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act, Pub. L. 103-129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA) amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901
et seq.,
(RE Act) to establish a new interest rate structure for insured electric loans. Insured electric loans approved on or after this date, are either municipal rate loans or hardship rate loans. Borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.8 are eligible for 5 percent hardship rate loans. The interest rate on loans to other borrowers is the municipal interest rate, and borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.7 are eligible for the interest rate cap on their municipal rate loans. Interest rates for the initial interest rate term and rollover terms (§ 1714.6) will be determined pursuant to § 1714.4. Provisions for prepayment are set forth in § 1714.9. The provisions of this subpart apply to loans approved on or after November 1, 1993, unless otherwise stated.
(b)
Insured electric loans approved prior to November 1, 1993.
These loans have a single interest rate applicable to the entire loan. The rate is generally 5 percent, but, in some cases, may be as low as 2 percent. These loans have a single interest rate term and may be prepaid at face value at any time. Provisions for discounted prepayment of these loans are set forth in 7 CFR part 1786.
§ 1714.4
Interest rates.
(a)
Municipal rate loans.
Each advance of funds on a municipal rate loan shall bear interest at a single rate for each interest rate term. All interest rates applicable to municipal rate loans will be increased by one eighth of one percent (0.125 percent), if the borrower elects to include in the loan agreement a prepayment option (call provision), allowing the borrower to prepay all or a portion of an advance on a date other than a rollover maturity date. However, no interest rate for any advances of a loan to a borrower who qualifies for the interest rate cap may exceed 7 percent.
(b)
Hardship rate loans.
All advances of funds on hardship rate loans shall bear interest at a rate of 5 percent.
(c)
Application procedure.
The borrower must indicate whether the application is for a municipal rate loan, with or without the interest rate cap, or a hardship rate loan. If the application is for a municipal rate loan, the borrower must also indicate whether they intend to elect the prepayment option.
[58 FR 66260, Dec. 20, 1993, as amended at 67 FR 16969, Apr. 9, 2002; 84 FR 32615, July 9, 2019]
§ 1714.5
Determination of interest rates on municipal rate loans.
(a) RUS will post on the RUS website, Electric Program HomePage, a schedule of interest rates for municipal rate loans at the beginning of each calendar quarter. The schedule will show the year of maturity and the applicable interest rates in effect for all funds advanced on municipal rate loans during the calendar quarter and all interest rate terms beginning in the quarter. All interest rates will be adjusted to the nearest one eighth of one percent (0.125 percent).
(b) The rate for interest rate terms of 20 years or longer will be the average of the 20 year rates published in the Bond Buyer in the 4 weeks specified in paragraph (d) of this section for the “11-
Bond GO Index” of Aa rated general obligation municipal bonds, or the successor to this index.
(c) The rate for terms of less than 20 years will be the average of the rates published in the Bond Buyer in the 4 weeks specified in paragraph (d) of this section in the table of “Municipal Market Data—General Obligation Yields” for Aa rated bonds, or the successor to this table, for obligations maturing in the same year as the interest rate term selected by the borrower.
(d) The interest rates on municipal rate loans shall not exceed the interest rate determined under section 307(a)(3)(A) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1927(a)(3)(A)) for Water and Waste Disposal loans. The method used to determine this rate is set forth in the regulations of the Rural Housing Service at 7 CFR 1942.17(f)(1) and (4). Pursuant to the RUS rule, the interest rates are set using as guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter.

§ 1714.6
Interest rate term.
(a)
Municipal rate loans.
Selection of interest rate terms shall be made by the borrower for each advance of funds. The minimum interest rate term shall be one year. RUS will send the borrower written confirmation of each rollover maturity date and the applicable interest rate.
(1) The initial interest rate term will begin on the date of the advance. All rollover interest rate terms will begin on the first day of a month, and except for the last interest rate term to final maturity, shall end on the last day of a month. All terms except for the initial interest rate term on an advance, and the last term to final maturity shall be in yearly increments.
(2) The following limits apply to the number of advances of funds that may be made to the borrower on any municipal rate loan:
(i) If the loan period is 2 years or less, not more than 6 advances;
(ii) If the loan period is more than 2 years, not more than 8 advances.
(3) For the initial interest rate term of an advance, a letter from an authorized official of the borrower indicating the selection of the term shall accompany the request for the advance.
(4) At the end of any interest rate term, the borrower shall pay all accrued interest and principal balance then due, and either prepay the remaining principal of the advance at face value, or roll over the remaining principal for a new term, provided that no interest rate term may end later than the date of the final maturity.
(i) If the borrower elects to prepay all or part of the remaining principal of the advance at face value, it must notify the Director of the appropriate Regional Division or the Power Supply Division in writing not later than 20 days before the rollover maturity date.
(ii) If the borrower wishes to elect a new interest rate term that is different from the term previously selected, it must notify RUS in writing of the new term not later than 20 days before the end of the current term. The election of the new term shall be addressed to the Director, Financial Operations Division, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.
(iii) If the borrower fails to notify RUS within the timeframes set out in this paragraph of its intention to prepay or elect a different interest rate term, RUS will automatically roll over the remaining principal for the shorter of, and at the interest rate applicable to:
(A) A period equal in length to the term that is expiring; or
(B) The remaining period to final maturity.
(b)
Hardship rate loans.
Loans made at the 5 percent hardship rate are made for a single term that cannot exceed the final maturity as set forth in 7 CFR 1710.115. The hardship interest rate applies to the entire amount of the loan.
[58 FR 66260, Dec. 20, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 3734, Jan. 19, 1995]
§ 1714.7
Interest rate cap.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the municipal interest rate may not exceed 7 percent on a loan advance to a borrower primarily
engaged in providing retail electric service if the borrower meets, at the time of loan approval, either the consumer density test set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or both the rate disparity test for the interest rate cap and the consumer income test set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(a)
Low consumer density test.
The borrower meets this test if the average number of consumers per mile of line of its total electric system, based on the most recent data available at the time of loan approval is less than 5.50.
(b)(1)
Rate disparity test for the interest rate cap.
The borrower meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is more than the average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table. The test will be based on the most recent calendar year for which full year DOE data are available at the time of loan approval and borrower data for the same year.
(2)
Consumer income test.
The borrower meets this test if either the average per capita income of the residents receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the average per capita income of residents of the state in which the borrower provides service or the median household income of the households receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the median household income of the households in the state.
(i) To qualify under the consumer income test, the borrower must include in its loan application information about the location of its residential consumers. The borrower must provide to RUS, based on the most recent data available at the time of loan application, either the number of consumers in each county it serves or the number of consumers in each census tract it serves. Using 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data, RUS will compare, on a weighted average basis, the average per capita and median household income of the counties or census tracts served by the borrower with state figures.
(ii) If there is reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the economic conditions of the borrower's consumers, the reasons will be documented and the borrower may furnish, or RD may obtain, additional information regarding such economic conditions. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, State, or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. The Administrator has the sole discretion to determine whether such data submitted by the borrower is sufficient to determine whether the borrower qualifies under the consumer income test.
(3)
Borrowers serving 2 or more states.
If a borrower serves consumers in 2 or more states, the rate disparity test and the consumer income test will be determined on a weighted average based on the percentage of the borrower's total consumers that are served in each state.
(c)
High density test.
If the average number of consumers per mile of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the interest rate cap will not apply to funds used for the purpose of furnishing or improving electric service to consumers located in an area that is an urban area at the time of loan approval, notwithstanding that the area must have been deemed a rural area for the purpose of qualifying for a loan under this part. (See the definition of “rural area” in 7 CFR 1710.2.) If the average number of consumers per mile of line of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the borrower must include, as a note on RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application for a loan subject to the interest rate cap, a breakdown of funds included in the proposed loan to furnish or improve service to consumers located in such urban areas. For such borrowers only
funds for those facilities serving consumers located outside an urban area are eligible for the interest rate cap.
[58 FR 66260, Dec. 20, 1993, as amended at 80 FR 9861, Feb. 24, 2015]
§ 1714.8
Hardship rate loans.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator shall make an insured electric loan for eligible purposes at the 5 percent hardship rate to a borrower primarily engaged in providing retail electric service if the borrower meets, at the time of loan approval, both the rate disparity test for hardship and the consumer income test described in paragraph (a) of this section; or the extremely high rates test set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A loan at the 5 percent hardship rate may also be made to any borrower pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section who, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, has experienced a severe hardship. The Administrator may not require a loan from a supplemental source in connection with a hardship rate loan.
(a)(1)
Rate disparity test for hardship.
The borrower meets this test if its average revenue per kWh sold is not less than 120 percent of the average revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service, and its average residential revenue per kWh is not less than 120 percent of the average residential revenue per kWh sold by all electric utilities in the state in which the borrower provides service. To determine whether a borrower meets this test, RUS will compare the borrower's average total revenue and average residential revenue with statewide data in the table of Average Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census Division and State, in the Electric Power Annual issued by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE), or the successor to this table. The test will be based on the most recent calendar year for which full year DOE data are available at the time of loan approval and borrower data for the same year.
(2)
Consumer income test.
The borrower meets this test if either the average per capita income of the residents receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the average per capita income of the residents of the state in which the borrower provides service or the median household income of the residents receiving electric service from the borrower is less than the median household income of the households in the state. RUS will determine whether the borrower qualifies under this test according to the procedure set forth in § 1714.7(b)(2).
(3)
Borrowers serving 2 or more states.
If a borrower serves consumers in 2 or more states, the rate disparity test and the consumer income tests will be determined on a weighted average based on the percentage of the borrower's total consumers that are served in each state.
(b)
Extremely high rates test.
Except as provided in this paragraph, the Administrator shall make an insured electric loan at the 5 percent hardship rate to any borrower whose residential revenue exceeds 15.0 cents per kWh sold. Residential revenue shall be calculated for the most recent full calendar year for which data are available and shall include sales to both seasonal and nonseasonal consumers. If, at the time of loan approval, the area to be served is an urbanized area (notwithstanding that the area must be deemed a rural area to qualify for a loan under this part (See the definition of “rural area” in 7 CFR 1710.2)), then the borrower must satisfy the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section to qualify to the 5 percent hardship interest rate. If at the time of loan approval, such area is outside an urbanized area, the loan shall not be subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section.
(c)
Administrator's discretion.
The Administrator may make a hardship rate loan if, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the borrower has experienced a severe hardship. The Administrator shall consider, among other matters, whether factors beyond the control or substantial influence of the borrower have had severe adverse effect on the borrower's ability to provide service consistent with the purposes of
the RE Act, and which prudent management could not reasonably anticipate and either prevent or insure against. Among the factors that may be considered are system damage due to unusual weather or other natural disasters or Acts of God, loss of substantial loads, extreme rate disparity compared to a contiguous utility, and other factors that cause severe financial hardship. The Administrator will also consider whether a hardship rate loan will provide significant relief to the borrower in dealing with the severe hardship.
(d)
High density test.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if the average number of consumers per mile of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the 5 percent hardship rate will not apply to funds used for the purpose of furnishing or improving electric service to consumers located in an area that is an urban area at the time of loan approval, notwithstanding that the area must have been deemed a rural area for the purpose of qualifying for a loan under this part. (See the definition of “rural area” in 7 CFR 1710.2.) If the average number of consumers per mile of line of the borrower's total electric system exceeds 17, the borrower must include, as a note on RUS Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part of the loan application for a loan at the 5 percent hardship rate, a breakdown of funds included in the proposed loan to furnish or improve service to consumers located in urban areas. For such borrowers only funds for those facilities serving consumers located outside an urban area are eligible for the 5 percent hardship rate.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0572-1013)
§ 1714.9
Prepayment of insured loans.
This section sets out provisions for prepayment of insured electric loans at face value. Provisions for discounted prepayment of RUS loans are set out in 7 CFR part 1786.
(a)
Municipal rate loans.
Loan documents for municipal rate loans shall provide for the following:
(1)
Prepayment on a rollover maturity date.
All, or a portion of, the outstanding balance on any advance from a municipal rate loan may be prepaid on any rollover maturity date pursuant to § 1714.6(a)(4).
(2)
Prepayment on a date other than a rollover maturity date.
A borrower may elect at the time of loan approval to include a prepayment option (call provision) that will allow the borrower to prepay all, or a portion of, the outstanding balance on any advance on a date other than a rollover maturity date. Interest rates on advances from loans with a prepayment provision will be increased as set forth in § 1714.4(a).
(b)
Hardship rate loans.
Loan documents for hardship loans shall provide that the loan may be prepaid at face value at any time without penalty.

§ 1717.150
General.
(a) This subpart establishes RUS policies and procedures for mergers of electric borrowers. These policies and procedures are intended to provide borrowers with the flexibility to negotiate and enter into mergers that offer advantages to the borrowers and to rural communities, and adequately protect the integrity and credit quality of RUS loans and loan guarantees.
(b) Consistent with prudent lending practices, the maintenance of adequate security for RUS loans and loan guarantees, and the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
) (RE Act), RUS encourages electric borrowers to consider mergers when such action is likely to contribute, in the long-term, to greater operating efficiency and financial soundness. Borrowers are specifically encouraged to explore mergers that are likely to enhance the ability of the successor to provide reliable electric service at reasonable cost to RE Act beneficiaries.
(c) Pursuant to the loan documents and RUS regulations, certain mergers are subject to RUS approval. See § 1717.615.
(d) Since RUS must take action in order to advance funds and otherwise conduct business with a successor, RUS encourages borrowers to consult RUS early in the process regardless of whether RUS approval of the merger is required. RUS will provide technical assistance and guidance to borrowers to help expedite the processing of their requests and to help resolve potential problems early in the process.
§ 1717.151
Definitions.
The definitions set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2 are applicable to this subpart unless otherwise stated. In addition, for the purpose of this subpart, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Active borrower
means an electric borrower that has, on the effective date, an outstanding insured or guaranteed loan from RUS for rural electrification, and whose eligibility for future RUS financing is not restricted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1786.
Active distribution borrower
means an electric distribution borrower that has, on the effective date, an outstanding insured or guaranteed loan from RUS for rural electrification, and whose eligibility for future RUS financing is not restricted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1786.
Consolidation.
See
Merger.
Coverage ratios
means collectively TIER, OTIER, DSC and ODSC, as these terms are defined in 7 CFR 1710.2.
Effective date
means the date a merger is effective pursuant to applicable state law.
Former distribution borrower
means any organization that
(1) Sells or intends to sell electric power and energy at retail;
(2) At one time had an outstanding loan made or guaranteed by RUS, or its predecessor the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) for rural electrification; and
(3) Either repaid such loans at face value or prepaid pursuant to 7 CFR part 1786.
Loan documents
means the mortgage (or other security instrument acceptable to RUS), the loan contract, and the promissory note(s) entered into between the borrower and RUS.
Merger
means:
(1) A consolidation where two or more companies are extinguished and a new successor is created, acquiring the assets, liabilities, franchises and powers of those passing out of existence;
(2) A merger where one company is absorbed by another, the former ceasing to exist as a separate business entity, and the latter retaining its own
identity and acquiring the assets, liabilities, franchises and powers of the former; or
(3) A transfer of mortgaged property by one company to another where the transferee acquires substantially as an entirety the assets, liabilities, franchises, and powers of the transferor.
New loan
means a loan to a successor approved by RUS on or after the effective date.
Preexisting loan
means a loan to a borrower approved by RUS prior to, and outstanding on the effective date.
Successor
means the entity that continues as the surviving business entity as of the effective date, and acquires all the assets, liabilities, franchises, and powers of the entity or entities ceasing to exist as of the effective date.
Transitional assistance
means financial relief provided to borrowers by RUS during a limited period of time following a merger.
§ 1717.152
Required documentation for all mergers.
In order for RUS to advance funds, send bills, and otherwise conduct business with a successor, the documents listed in this section must be submitted to RUS regardless of the need for RUS approval of the merger. Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that these documents are received by RUS in timely fashion. In cases of mergers that require RUS approval, or cases where borrowers must submit requests for transitional assistance, the documents listed in this section may be combined with the documents required by § 1717.157 and/or § 1717.160 where appropriate.
(a) Prior to the effective date, borrowers must submit:
(1) A transmittal letter on corporate letterhead signed by the manager of each active borrower that is a party to the proposed merger indicating the borrower's intention to merge and tentative timeframes, including the proposed effective date;
(2) An original certified board resolution from each party to the proposed merger affirming the board's support of the merger;
(3) All documents necessary to evidence the merger pursuant to applicable law. Examples include plan of merger, articles of merger, amended articles of incorporation, bylaws, and notices and filings required by law. These documents may be copies of documents filed elsewhere, unless otherwise specified by RUS; and
(4) A letter addressed to the Administrator from the counsel of at least one of the active borrowers briefly describing the merger and indicating the relevant statutes under which the merger will be consummated.
(b) On or after the effective date, borrowers must submit:
(1) An opinion of counsel from the successor addressing, among other things, any pending litigation, proper authorization and consummation of the merger, proper filing and perfection of RUS' security interest, and all approvals required by law. RUS will provide the form of the opinion of counsel to the successor;
(2) A letter signed by the manager of the successor advising RUS of the effective date of the merger; the corporate name, address, and phone number; the names of the officers of the successor; and the taxpayer identification number; and
(3) Evidence of proper filing and perfection of RUS' security interest, as instructed by RUS, and an executed loan contract.
§ 1717.153
Transitional assistance.
RUS recognizes that short-term financial stresses can follow even the most beneficial mergers. To help stabilize electric rates, enhance the credit quality of outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the Government, and otherwise ease the transition period before the long-term efficiencies and economies of a merger can be realized, RUS may approve one or more types of transitional assistance to a successor under the conditions set forth in this part.
§ 1717.154
Transitional assistance in connection with new loans.
Requests for transitional assistance in connection with new loans may be submitted to RUS no later than the loan application.
(a)
Loan processing priority.
(1) RUS loans are generally processed in chronological order based on the date the
complete application is received in the regional or division office. At the borrower's request, RUS may offer loan processing priority for the first loan to a successor, provided that the loan is approved by RUS not later than 5 years after the effective date of the merger. In considering the request, the Administrator will take into account, among other factors, the amount of the loan application, whether there is a significant backlog in pending loan applications, the impact that loan priority would have on the backlog, the savings and efficiencies to be realized from the merger and the relative importance of loan priority to facilitating the merger. The Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, grant or decline to grant priority, or grant priority for a limited amount of the loan application while deferring for later consideration the remainder of the application.
(2) For any subsequent loans approved during those 5 years, RUS may offer loan processing priority. In reviewing requests for loan processing priority on subsequent loans, RUS will consider the loan authority for the fiscal year, the borrower's projected cash flows, its electric rates and rate disparity, and the likely mitigation effects of priority loan processing.
See
7 CFR 1710.108 and 1710.119.
(3) Loan processing priority is available following any merger where at least one of the merging parties is an active borrower.
(b)
Supplemental financing.
(1) RUS generally requires that an applicant for a municipal rate loan obtain a portion of its debt financing from a supplemental source without an RUS guarantee. See 7 CFR 1710.110. RUS will, at the borrower's request, waive the requirement to obtain supplemental financing for the first RUS loan approved after the effective date if that first loan is a municipal rate loan whose loan period does not exceed 2 years, and the loan is approved by RUS not later than 5 years after the effective date. For any subsequent loans approved during these 5 years, or if the borrower requests a loan period longer than 2 years, RUS may, subject to the availability of loan funds, waive or reduce the amount of supplemental financing required. In reviewing requests to reduce or waive supplemental financing on subsequent loans or on loans with a loan period longer than 2 years, RUS will consider the differences in interest rates between RUS and supplemental loans and the impacts of this difference on the borrower's projected cash flows and its electric rates and rate disparity. If significant differences would result, the waiver will be granted.
(2) Waiver of supplemental financing may be available if:
(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers,
or
(ii) At least one of the merging parties is an active distribution borrower, all merging parties are either active distribution borrowers or former distribution borrowers,
and
the merger is effective after December 19, 1996.
(c)
Reimbursement of general funds and interim financing.
(1) Borrowers may request RUS loan funds to reimburse general funds and/or interim financing used to finance equipment and facilities included in a RUS approved construction work plan or amendment if the construction was completed immediately preceding the current loan period. This reimbursement period is generally limited to 48 months. See 7 CFR 1710.109. RUS may, in connection with the first RUS loan approved after the effective date, approve a reimbursement period of up to 48 months prior to the current loan period if the loan is approved not later than 5 years after the effective date. In reviewing requests for this longer reimbursement period, RUS will consider the stresses that the transaction and other costs of entering into the merger places on the borrower's rates and cash flows, and the mitigating effects of more generous reimbursement.
(2) A longer reimbursement period may be available if:
(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers,
or
(ii) At least one of the merging parties is an active distribution borrower, all merging parties are either active distribution borrowers of former distribution borrowers,
and
the merger is effective after December 19, 1996.
[61 FR 66871, Dec. 19, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 58322, Sept. 16, 2002; 86 FR 36197, July 9, 2021]
§ 1717.155
Transitional assistance affecting new and preexisting loans.
Requests for transitional assistance affecting new and preexisting loans must be received by RUS no later than 2 years after the effective date.
(a)
Section 12 deferments.
(1) Section 12 of the RE Act (7 U.S.C. 912) allows RUS to extend the time of payment of interest or principal of RUS loans. Section 12 deferments do not extend the final maturity of the loan; lower payments during the deferment period result in higher payments later. Therefore, RUS may approve a Section 12 deferment of loan payments of up to 5 years only if such deferments will help to avoid substantial increases in retail electric rates during the transition period, without placing borrowers in financial stress after the deferment period.
(2) Section 12 deferment may be available following any merger where at least one of the merging parties is an active borrower.
(b)
Coverage ratios.
Required levels for coverage ratios are set forth in 7 CFR 1710.114 and in the loan documents. RUS may approve a plan, on a case by case basis, that provides for a phase-in period for these coverage ratios of up to 5 years from the effective date. Under such a plan the successor would be permitted to project and achieve lower levels for one or more of these coverage ratios during the phase-in period.
(1) A phase-in plan for coverage ratios must provide a pro forma level for each ratio during each year of the phase-in period and be supported by a financial forecast covering a period of not less than 10 years from the effective date of the merger. The plan must demonstrate that a minimum TIER level of 1.00 will be achieved in each year, that trends will be generally favorable, that the borrower will achieve the levels required in its loan documents and RUS regulations by the end of the phase-in period, and that these levels will be maintained in subsequent years.
(2) In reviewing phase-in plans for coverage ratios, RUS will review rates, rate disparity, and likely mitigating effects of the proposed phase-in plan.
(3) The borrower is responsible for obtaining approvals of supplemental lenders.
(4) Upon RUS approval of a phase-in plan, the levels in that plan will be substituted for the levels required in the borrower's preexisting loan documents and will be incorporated in any new loan or security documents.
(5) A phase in plan for coverage ratios may be available if:
(i) All parties to the merger are active distribution borrowers,
or
(ii) At least one of the merging parties is an active distribution borrower, all merging parties are either active distribution borrowers or former distribution borrowers, and the merger is effective after December 19, 1996.
§ 1717.156
Transitional assistance affecting preexisting loans.
The fund advance period for an insured loan, which is the period during which RUS may advance loan funds to a borrower, terminates automatically after a specific period of time.
See
7 CFR 1710.602. If, on the effective date the original fund advance period or the fund advance period as extended pursuant to 7 CFR 1710.602(b), on any preexisting RUS loan to any of the active borrowers involved in a merger has not terminated, such fund advance period shall be automatically lengthened by 2 years. However, under no circumstances shall RUS ever make or approve an advance, regardless of the last day for an advance on the loan note or any extension by the Administrator, later than September 30 of the fifth year after the fiscal year of obligation if such date would result in the RUS obligating or permitting advance of funds contrary to the Anti-Deficiency Act. On the borrower's request RUS will prepare documents necessary for the advance of loan funds. RUS will prepare documents for the borrower's execution that will reflect this extension and will provide the legal authority for RUS to advance funds to the successor.
[89 FR 17274, Mar. 11, 2024]
§ 1717.157
Requests for transitional assistance.
(a) If the merger requires RUS approval, the borrower should, where possible, indicate that it desires transitional assistance at the time it requests approval of the merger. The formal request for transitional assistance must be received by RUS as specified in §§ 1717.155 and 171.156. Documents listed in this section may be combined with the documents required by §§ 1717.152 and/or 1717.160 where appropriate. If the request for transitional assistance is submitted at the same time as a loan application, documents listed in this section may be combined with the loan application documents where appropriate. See 7 CFR part 1710, subpart I. A request for transitional assistance must include:
(1) Transmittal letter(s) formally listing the types of transitional assistance requested. If the request is submitted before the effective date, a transmittal letter must be signed by the manager of each party to the transaction. If the request is submitted on or after the effective date, a transmittal letter must be signed by the manager of the successor. Transmittal letter(s) must be signed originals on corporate letterhead stationery;
(2) Board resolution(s). If the request is submitted before the effective date, a separate board resolution must be submitted from each entity involved in the merger. If the request is submitted on or after the effective date, a board resolution from the successor must be submitted. Each board resolution must be a certified original;
(3) A merger plan, financial forecasts, and any available studies such as net present value analyses showing the anticipated costs and benefits of the merger and likely timeframes for the merger. The merger plan must clearly identify those benefits that cannot be achieved without a merger, and those benefits that can be achieved through other means;
(4) If the transitional assistance requires RUS approval, the type and extent of the mitigation that the transitional assistance is expected to provide; and
(5) Other information that may be relevant.
(b) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that requests for transitional assistance are complete and sound in form and substance when they are submitted to RUS. After submitting a request, borrowers shall promptly notify RUS of any changes or events that materially affect the request or any information in the request.
(c) In considering whether to approve requests for transitional assistance, RUS will evaluate the costs and benefits of the merger; the type and extent of the likely transitional stress; whether the transitional assistance requested is likely to materially mitigate such stress; and the likely impacts on electric rates and on the security of RUS loans. Review factors applicable to each type of transitional assistance are set forth in §§ 1717.154-1717.156.
§ 1717.158
Mergers with borrowers who prepaid RUS loans.
In some cases, an active distribution borrower may merge with a borrower that has prepaid RUS debt at a discount pursuant to 7 CFR part 1786, and whose eligibility for future RUS financing is thereby restricted. During the period when the restrictions on future financing are in effect, the successor will be eligible for RUS loans to finance facilities to serve consumers located in the territory that was served by the active distribution borrower immediately prior to the effective date, provided that other requirements for loan eligibility are met.
§ 1717.159
Applications for RUS approvals of mergers.
If a proposed merger requires RUS approval according to RUS regulations and/or the loan documents executed by any of the active borrowers involved, the application must be submitted to RUS not later than 90 days prior to the effective date of the proposed borrower action. A distribution borrower should consult with its assigned RUS general field representative, and a power supply borrower with the Director, Power Supply Division for general information prior to submitting the request.
§ 1717.160
Application contents.
An application for RUS approval of a merger must include the documents
listed in this section. Documents listed in this section may be combined with the documents required by §§ 1717.152 and/or 1717.157 where appropriate.
(a)
Transmittal letters
signed by the managers of all borrowers and non-borrowers who are parties to the proposed merger. These letters must include the actual corporate name, address, and taxpayer identification number of all parties to the proposed merger. The transmittal letters must be signed originals on corporate letterhead stationery.
(b)
Resolutions from the boards of directors
of all borrowers and non-borrowers who are parties to the proposed merger. This document is the formal request by each entity for RUS approval of the proposed merger. The board resolution must include a description of the proposed merger, including timeframes, and authorization for RUS to release appropriate information to supplemental or other lenders, and for these lenders to release appropriate information to RUS. Each board resolution must be a certified original.
(c)
Evidence
that the proposed merger will result in a viable entity, and that the security of outstanding RUS loans will not be adversely affected by the action. This evidence shall include financial forecasts, and any available studies such as net present value analyses covering a period of not less than 10 years from the effective date of the merger, as well as information about any threatened actions by other parties that could adversely affect the financial condition of any of the parties to the proposed merger, or of the successor. Such threatened actions may include annexations or other actions affecting service territory, loads, rates or other such matters.
(d)
Regulatory information
about pending federal or state proceedings pertaining to any of the parties that could have material effects on the successor.
(e)
Rate information.
Distribution and power supply borrowers shall submit schedules of proposed rates after the merger, including the effects of the proposed action on rates and the status of any pending rate cases before a state regulatory authority. The rates of power supply borrowers are subject to RUS approval. If rates are not projected to change after the merger, a statement to that effect will suffice.
(f)
Area coverage and line extension policies.
If any distribution systems are parties to the proposed merger, a statement of proposed area coverage and line extension policies for the successor.
§ 1717.161
Application process.
(a) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that their applications for RUS approval of a merger are complete and sound in form and substance when they are submitted to RUS. After submitting an application, borrowers shall promptly notify RUS of any changes or events that materially affect the application or any information in the application.
(b) In reviewing borrower requests for approval of mergers, RUS will consider the likely effects of the action on the ability of the successor to provide reliable electric service at reasonable cost to RE Act beneficiaries and on the security of outstanding RUS loans. Among the factors RUS will consider are whether the proposed merger is likely to:
(1) Contribute to greater operating efficiency and financial soundness;
(2) Mitigate high electric rates and or rate disparity;
(3) Help borrowers to diversify their loads or otherwise hedge risks;
(4) Have beneficial effects on rural economic development in the community served by the borrower, such as diversifying the economic base or alleviating unemployment; and
(5) Provide other benefits consistent with the purposes of the RE Act.
(c) RUS will not approve a merger if, in the sole judgment of the Administrator, such action is likely to have an adverse effect on the credit quality of outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the Government. RUS will thoroughly review each request for approval of such action, including review of the feasibility and security of outstanding Government loans according to the standards in 7 CFR 1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively, and in other RUS regulations.
(d) RUS will keep the borrowers apprised of the progress of their applications.

# Subpart M—Operational Controls

# Source:
60 FR 67405, Dec. 29, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1717.600
General.
(a)
General.
The loan contract and mortgage between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and electric borrowers imposes certain restrictions and controls on the borrowers and gives RUS (and other co-mortgagees in the case of the mortgage) the right to approve or disapprove certain actions contemplated by the borrowers. Certain of these controls and approval rights are referred to informally as “operational controls” because they pertain to decisions or actions with respect to the operation of the borrowers' electric systems. The approval authority granted to RUS by the loan contract or mortgage regarding each decision or action subject to controls is often stated in broad, unlimited terms. This subpart lists the main operational controls affecting borrowers and establishes for each area of control the circumstances under which RUS approval of a decision or action by a borrower is either required or not required. In some cases, only the general principles or general circumstances pertaining to RUS approval or control are presented in this subpart, while the details regarding the circumstances and requirements of RUS approval or control are set forth in other RUS regulations. Since this subpart addresses only the main operational controls, failure to address a control or approval right in this subpart in no way invalidates such controls or rights established by the loan contract, mortgage, other agreements between a borrower and RUS, and RUS regulations.
(b)
Case by case amendments.
Upon written notice to a borrower, RUS may amend or annul the approvals and exceptions to controls set forth in this subpart or other RUS regulations if the borrower is in violation of any provision of its loan documents or any other agreement with RUS, or if RUS determines that loan security and/or repayment is threatened. Such amendment or annulment will apply to decisions and actions of the borrower after said written notice has been provided by RUS.
(c)
Generic notices.
By written notice to all borrowers or a group of borrowers, RUS may grant or waive approval of decisions and actions by the borrowers that are controlled under the loan documents and RUS regulations. RUS may also by written notice withdraw or cut back its grant or waiver of approval of said decisions and actions made by previous written notice, but may not by such notice extend its authority to approve decisions and actions by borrowers beyond the authority granted by the loan documents and RUS regulations.
§ 1717.601
Applicability.
(a) The approvals and exceptions to controls conveyed by this subpart apply only to controls and approval rights normally included in RUS loan documents dated prior to January 29, 1996. They do not apply to special controls and approval requirements included in loan documents or other agreements executed between a borrower and RUS that relate to individual problems or circumstances specific to an individual borrower.
(b) The approvals and exceptions to controls granted by RUS in this subpart shall not in any way affect the rights of other co-mortgagees under the mortgage or their loan contracts.
§ 1717.602

(3) If the disposition does not fall within the ambit of paragraph (b) of this section so that RUS Approval is required, the following then apply:
(i) If the Federal Government is the sole lien holder of the borrower's capital assets, approval of the disposition by the Federal Government will be indicated on RUS Form 369, when returned to the seller.
(ii) If the Federal Government holds a lien jointly with supplemental lenders, joint approval for the disposition will be necessary and the borrower will forward the following:
(A) Information should be forwarded directly to RUS and one copy to all supplemental lenders;
(B) When approved by RUS, the information will be forwarded by RUS to the supplemental lenders (and a notice letter advising that RUS has forwarded this information to supplemental lenders will be issued by RUS to the borrower); and
(C) The supplemental lenders will be instructed, in the RUS transmittal memorandum, to execute the documents and return them to the seller. The supplemental lenders will also be instructed to notify RUS when the completed documents are returned to the seller.
(e) The disposition of proceeds will be handled as follows:
(1) The disposition of proceeds from the disposition of a capital asset shall be the same regardless of whether or not RUS approval of the sale is required.
(2) If the gross proceeds from the disposition of the assets total less than $50,000 the borrower shall deposit the proceeds in its general fund account and are to be used for purposes related to the utility business as determined by the management of the borrower.
(3) Proceeds from individual dispositions of property where the gross proceeds total $50,000 or more, should be distributed and accounted for as follows:
(i) Deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account. When funds are deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account, the borrower shall notify RUS in writing so that the budget records can be adjusted. The funds are to be used for the construction or acquisition of the borrower's utility system;
(ii) Paid to RUS and any secured supplemental lenders if the borrower has concurrent loans outstanding, by application of such funds as a prepayment on the notes of all lenders pro-rata according to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the notes then outstanding, as designated by the noteholders, and in accordance with the borrower's loan documents;
(iii) If the borrower has no concurrent supplemental loans outstanding, applied to RUS as a payment to be applied to the note or notes issued with respect to loans made or guaranteed by RUS, or any portion of a note with respect to a loan made by RUS, and designated by the borrower or RUS; or
(iv) In the case of dispositions of SO
2
allowances, the funds from the sale of allowances should be deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account. If any entity prefers to deposit the funds into the General Fund Account, specific RUS approval will be given on a case-by-case basis. Accompanying any request for approval to deposit the funds into the General Fund Account should be a completed RUS Form 369 along with a summary of the anticipated disposition of funds from the General Fund Account;
(v) In the case of dispositions of equipment, materials, or scrap, all proceeds (regardless of the amount) from the sale should be deposited into the General Fund Account to be used for the purchase of other property useful in the mortgagor's utility business, not necessarily of the same kind as the property disposed, which is subject to the lien of the mortgage;
(vi) The Administrator may allow a borrower to deposit the proceeds of the disposition of the asset directly into the General Funds Account instead of the Construction Fund Trustee Account if the borrower has no `Balance in Reserve' on its most recent loan advances 605 report and does not anticipate submitting any new loan applications to RUS. The borrower must receive written approval from RUS before it deposits any proceeds into its General Funds Account.
(f) The borrower must provide the following to RUS for any disposition of a capital asset that does not fall within the scope of paragraph (b) of this section and requires RUS approval:
(1) RUS Form 369 with original signature;
(2) If the disposition involves a condemnation, the borrower must attach a copy of the petition or complaint in the condemnation suit to the RUS Form 369. Items 10, 11, and 12 of the RUS Form 369 may be completed by referring to the attachment. Item 14 need not be completed. The RUS Form 369 and a copy of the petition or complaint in condemnation cases should be submitted to RUS promptly after the petition or complaint has been received by the borrower;
(3) If the purchaser will require the disposition of the asset be free and clear of liens, the partial release of the lien should be prepared by the attorney for the seller or purchaser. It will be the responsibility of the borrower and the borrower's attorney to ensure the accuracy and legal effectiveness of a proposed partial release of the lien;
(4) If the disposition involves real estate or plant in place, in addition to the information required for all dispositions, the seller will provide a brief description of the property being disposed and a statement explaining why the asset is no longer needed for the borrower's system. The borrower shall also provide the following information to RUS for the disposition of real estate and plant in place:
(i) Except in condemnation cases, a statement of agreement between the seller and the purchaser on the proposed selling price. When applicable, include adjustments such as capital additions and retirements, depreciation, taxes, distribution of membership fees, deposits and contributions, prepaid and delinquent bills and accounts, insurance, assignment of easements, the proposed closing date, and other pertinent information. Generally, the closing date selected should not be less than 90 days after the date the required information is forwarded to RUS;
(ii) A complete legal description or real property supported by key and detail maps showing the location of lines or other capital assets to be disposed;
(iii) A breakdown of consumers by classification showing number, mileage, average kWh usage, and revenues for the portion of lines being disposed;
(iv) An inventory of lines on a priced assembly or record unit basis, or, in the case of facilities other than lines, a detailed breakdown of separable units and their costs;
(v) Description and estimated costs of changes, if any, which must be made in the seller's system in order to maintain satisfactory operations after the sale has been completed;
(vi) Other pertinent data such as the physical condition of the property to be disposed, a copy of the lease if facilities to be disposed of are on leased land, and the approval of applicable regulatory bodies where required;
(vii) The retail rates to be applied to the consumers on the lines being disposed (comparative rate schedules); and
(viii) If the purchaser is another RUS borrower or a borrower from a supplemental lender, a description and the estimated costs of the changes, if any, necessary to integrate the properties being acquired with the purchaser's existing system for satisfactory operations.
(5) If the purchaser is to pay the seller in installments, such information should be noted on Item 9 of the RUS Form 369. A sales agreement between
the seller and the purchaser, a note or other debt instrument in favor of the seller, and a security agreement in favor of the seller should be executed and collaterally assigned by the seller to the U.S. Government and the supplemental lenders, if applicable. The partial release of the lien will not be executed by RUS, if applicable, until the final installment payment has been received by the seller. The disposition of the proceeds from installment sales will be the same as from cash dispositions);
(6) Dispositions involving exchanges or trades of real estate or plant in place between a borrower and a non-RUS borrower will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis.
(g) Expenditures by the seller in conjunction with the dispositions of capital assets will be properly accounted for and all associated documents shall be retained for review when RUS conducts its next Loan Fund and Accounting Review.

§ 1717.650
Purpose.
This subpart sets forth general regulations for implementing and interpreting provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract regarding investments, loans, and guarantees made by electric borrowers, as well as the provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, including section 312 (7 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
) (RE Act), permitting, in certain circumstances, that electric borrowers under the RE Act may, without restriction or prior approval of the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), invest their own funds and make loans or guarantees.
§ 1717.651
General.
(a)
Policy.
RUS electric borrowers are encouraged to utilize their own funds to participate in the economic development of rural areas, provided that such activity does not in any way put government funds at risk or impair a borrower's ability to repay its indebtedness to RUS and other lenders. In considering whether to make loans, investments, or guarantees, borrowers are expected to act in accordance with prudent business practices and in conformity with the laws of the jurisdictions in which they serve. RUS assumes that borrowers will use the latitude afforded them by section 312 of the RE Act primarily to make needed investments in rural community infrastructure projects (such as water and waste systems, garbage collection services, etc.) and in job creation activities (such as providing technical, financial, and managerial assistance) and other activities to promote business development and economic diversification in rural communities. Nonetheless, RUS believes that borrowers should continue to give primary consideration to safety and liquidity in the management of their funds.
(b)
Applicability of this subpart.
This subpart applies to all distribution and power supply borrowers regardless of when their loan contract or mortgage was executed.

Any borrower not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreements with RUS must, unless the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other agreement with RUS specifically provides otherwise with respect to such a borrower:
(a) Obtain prior written approval from the Administrator to invest its own funds or to make loans or guarantees regardless of the aggregate amount of such investments, loans, or guarantees; and
(b) If requested by the Administrator, restructure or reduce the amount of its investments, loans, and guarantees to a level determined by the Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, to be in the financial interest of the government with respect to loan security and/or repayment. If the borrower does not so restructure or reduce its portfolio within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of the required action, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and mortgage.
§ 1717.654
Transactions below the 15 percent level.
(a) A borrower in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS may, without prior written approval of the Administrator, invest its own funds or make loans or guarantees not in excess of 15 percent of its total utility plant without regard to any provision contained in any RUS mortgage or RUS loan contract to the effect that the borrower must obtain prior approval from RUS, provided, however, that the borrower may not, without the prior written approval of the Administrator, make such investments, loans, and guarantees to extend, add to, or modify its electric system. Moreover, funds necessary to make timely payments of principal and interest on loans secured by the RUS mortgage remain subject to RUS controls on borrower investments, loans and guarantees.
(b) RUS will not consider requests from borrowers to exclude investments, loans, or guarantees made below the 15 percent level. (Categorical exclusions are set forth in § 1717.655.)
§ 1717.655
Exclusion of certain investments, loans, and guarantees.
(a) In calculating the amount of investments, loans and guarantees permitted under this subpart, there is excluded from the computation any investment, loan or guarantee of the type which by the terms of the borrower's RUS mortgage or RUS loan contract the borrower may make in unlimited amounts without RUS approval.
(b) Furthermore, the borrower may make unlimited investments, without prior approval of the Administrator, in:
(1) Securities or deposits issued, guaranteed or fully insured as to payment by the United States Government or any agency thereof;
(2) Capital term certificates, bank stock, or other similar securities of the supplemental lender which have been purchased as a condition of membership in the supplemental lender, or as a condition of receiving financial assistance from such lender, as well as any other investment made in, or loans made to, the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, the Saint Paul Bank for Cooperatives, and CoBank, ACB;
(3) Patronage capital allocated from an electric power supply cooperative of which the borrower is a member; and
(4) Patronage capital allocated from an electric distribution cooperative to a power supply borrower.
(c) Without prior approval of the Administrator, the borrower may also:
(1) Invest or lend funds derived directly from:
(i) Grants which the borrower in not obligated to repay, regardless of the source or purpose of the grant; and
(ii) Loans received from or guaranteed by any Federal, State or local government program designed to promote rural economic development, provided that the borrower uses the loan proceeds for such purpose;
(2) Make loans guaranteed by an agency of USDA, up to the amount of principal whose repayment, with interest, is fully guaranteed; and
(3)(i) Make unlimited investments in and unlimited loans to finance the following community infrastructure that serves primarily consumers located in rural areas as defined in 7 CFR 1710.2, and guarantee debt issued for the construction or acquisition of such infrastructure, up to an aggregate amount of such guarantees not to exceed 20 percent of the borrower's equity:
(A) Water and waste disposal systems;
(B) Solid waste disposal systems;
(C) Telecommunication and other electronic communication systems; and
(D) Natural gas distribution systems.
(ii) In each of the four cases in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, if the system is a component of a larger organization other than the borrower itself (e.g., if it is a component of a subsidiary of the borrower or a corporation independent of the borrower), to be eligible for the exemption the borrower must certify annually that a majority of the gross revenues of the larger organization during the most recent fiscal year came from customers of said system who were located in a rural area.
(d) Also excluded from the calculation of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower are:
(1) Amounts properly recordable in Account 142 Customer Accounts Receivable, and Account 143 Other Accounts Receivable;
(2) Any investment, loan, or guarantee that the borrower is required to make by an agency of USDA, for example, as a condition of obtaining financial assistance for itself or any other person or organization;
(3) Investments included in an irrevocable trust for the purpose of funding post-retirement benefits of the borrower's employees;
(4) Reserves required by a reserve bond agreement or other agreement legally binding on the borrower, that are dedicated to making required payments on debt secured under the RUS mortgage, not to exceed the amount of reserves specifically required by such agreements; and
(5) Investments included in an irrevocable trust approved by RUS and dedicated to the payment of decommissioning costs of nuclear facilities of the borrower.
(e) Grandfathered exclusions. All amounts of individual investments, loans, and guarantees excluded by RUS as of February 16, 1995 shall remain excluded. Such exclusions must have been based on the RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, regulations, bulletins, memoranda, or other written notice from RUS. Profits, interest, and other returns earned (regardless of whether or not they are reinvested) on such investments, loans and guarantees after February 16, 1995 shall be excluded only if they are eligible for exclusion under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Any new commitments of money to such investments, loans and guarantees shall likewise be excluded only if they are eligible under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(f) Any investment, loan or guarantee made by a borrower that is not
excluded under this section or under § 1717.657(d) shall be included in the aggregate amount of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower, regardless of whether RUS has specifically approved the investment, loan or guarantee under § 1717.657(c), or has approved a related transaction (e.g., a lien accommodation).
§ 1717.656
Exemption of certain borrowers from controls.
(a) Any distribution or power supply borrower that meets all of the following criteria is exempted from the provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract that require RUS approval of investments, loans, and guarantees, except investments, loans, and guarantees made to extend, add to, or modify the borrower's electric system:
(1) The borrower is in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS;
(2) The average revenue per kWh for residential service received by the borrower during the two most recent calendar years does not exceed 130 percent of the average revenue per kWh for residential service during the same period for all residential consumers located in the state or states served by the borrower. This criterion applies only to distribution borrowers and does not apply to power supply borrowers. If a borrower serves customers in more than one state, the state average revenue per kWh will be based on a weighted average using the kWh sales by the borrower in each state as the weight. The calculation will be based on the two most recent calendar years for which both borrower and state-wide data are available. If a borrower fails to qualify for an exemption based solely on its failure to meet this criterion on rate disparity, at the borrower's request the Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion, exempt the borrower if he or she finds that the borrower's strengths with respect to the other criteria are sufficient to offset any weakness due to rate disparity;
(3) In the most recent calendar year for which data are available, the borrower achieved an operating TIER of at least 1.0 and an operating DSC of at least 1.0, in each case based on the average of the two highest ratios achieved in the three most recent calendar years;
(4) The borrower's ratio of net utility plant to long-term debt is at least 1.1, based on year-end data for the most recent calendar year for which data are available; and
(5) The borrower's equity is equal to at least 27 percent of its total assets, based on year-end data for the most recent calendar year for which data are available.
(b) While borrowers meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section are exempt from RUS approval of investments, loans and guarantees, they are nevertheless subject to the record-keeping, reporting, and other requirements of § 1717.658.
(c) Any borrower exempt under paragraph (a) of this section that ceases to meet the criteria for exemption shall, upon written notice from RUS, no longer be exempt and shall be subject to the provisions of this subpart applicable to non-exempt borrowers. A borrower may regain its exemption if it subsequently meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, and is so notified in writing by RUS.
(d)(1) A borrower that loses its exemption and is not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreement with RUS may be required to restructure or reduce its portfolio of investments, loans and guarantees as provided in § 1717.653(b). If the borrower's portfolio exceeds the 15 percent level, the borrower will be required to restructure or reduce its portfolio to the 15 percent level or below. For example, if the borrower's mortgage or loan contract has an approval threshold, the borrower may be required to reduce its portfolio to that level, which in many cases is 3 percent of total utility plant.
(2) A borrower that loses its exemption but is in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS will be required, if its investments, loans and guarantees exceed the 15 percent level, to restructure or reduce its portfolio to the 15 percent level, unless the Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, determines that such action would not be in the financial interest
of the government with respect to loan security and/or repayment. (Such borrower is eligible to ask RUS to exclude a portion of its investments under the conditions set forth in § 1717.657(d).)
(3) If a borrower required to reduce or restructure its portfolio does not fully comply within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of its loss of exemption, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and/or RUS mortgage.
(e) By no later than July 1 of each year, RUS will provide written notice to any borrowers whose exemption status has changed as a result of more recent data being available for the qualification criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, or as a result of other reasons, such as corrections in the available data. An explanation of the reasons for any changes in exemption status will also be provided to the borrowers affected.
§ 1717.657
Investments above the 15 percent level by certain borrowers not exempt under § 1717.656(a).
(a)
General.
(1) This section applies only to borrowers that are in compliance with all provisions of their mortgage, loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS and that do not qualify for an exemption from RUS investment controls under § 1717.656(a).
(2) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the Administrator's authority to exercise approval rights over investments, loans, and guarantees made by a borrower that is not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract and any other agreements with RUS.
(b)
Distribution borrowers.
Distribution borrowers not exempt from RUS investment controls under § 1717.656(a) may not make investments, loans and guarantees in an aggregate amount in excess of 15 percent of total utility plant. Above the 15 percent level, such borrowers will be restricted to excluded investments, loans and guarantees as defined in § 1717.655. (However, they are eligible to ask RUS to exclude a portion of their investments under the conditions set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.)
(c)
Power supply borrowers.
(1) Power supply borrowers not exempt from RUS investment controls under § 1717.656(a) may request approval to exceed the 15 percent level if all of the following criteria are met:
(i) Satisfactory evidence has been provided that the borrower is in compliance with all provisions of its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and any other agreements with RUS;
(ii) The borrower is not in financial workout and has not had its government debt restructured;
(iii) The borrower has equity equal to at least 5 percent of its total assets; and
(iv) After approval of the investment, loan or guarantee, the aggregate of the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees will not exceed 20 percent of the borrower's total utility plant.
(2) Borrower requests for approval to exceed the 15 percent level will be considered on a case by case basis. The requests must be made in writing.
(3) In considering borrower requests, the Administrator will take the following factors into consideration:
(i) The repayment of all loans secured under the RUS mortgage will continue to be assured, and loan security must continue to be reasonably adequate, even if the entire investment or loan is lost or the borrower is required to perform for the entire amount of the guarantee. These risks will be considered along with all other risks facing the borrower, whether or not related to the investment, loan or guarantee;
(ii) In the case of investments, the investment must be made in an entity separate from the borrower, such as a subsidiary, whereby the borrower is protected from any liabilities incurred by the separate entity, unless the borrower demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that making the investment directly rather than through a separate entity will present no substantial risk to the borrower in addition to the possibility of losing all or part of the original investment;
(iii) The borrower must be economically and financially sound as indicated by its costs of operation, competitiveness, operating TIER and operating DSC, physical condition of the plant, ratio of equity to total assets, ratio of net utility plant to long-term debt, and other factors; and
(iv) Other factors affecting the security and repayment of government debt, as determined by the Administrator on a case by case basis.
(4) If the Administrator approves an investment, loan or guarantee, such investment, loan or guarantee will continue to be included when calculating the borrower's ratio of aggregate investments, loans and guarantees to total utility plant.
(d)
Distribution and power supply borrowers.
If the aggregate of the investments, loans and guarantees of a distribution or power supply borrower exceeds 15 percent of the borrower's total utility plant as a result of the cumulative profits or margins, net of losses, earned on said transactions over the past 10 calendar years (i.e., the sum of all profits earned during the 10 years on all transactions—including interest earned on cash accounts, loans, and similar transactions—less the sum of all losses experienced on all transactions during the 10 years) then:
(1) The borrower will not be in default of the RUS loan contract or RUS mortgage with respect to required approval of investments, loans and guarantees, provided that the borrower had not made additional net investments, loans or guarantees without approval after reaching the 15 percent level; and
(2) At the request of the borrower, the Administrator in his or her sole discretion may decide to exclude up to the amount of net profits or margins earned on the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees during the past 10 calendar years, if the Administrator determines that such exclusion will not increase loan security risks. The borrower must provide documentation satisfactory to the Administrator as to the current status of its investments, loans and guarantees and the net profits earned during the past 10 years. Any exclusion approved by the Administrator may or may not reduce the level of investments, loans and guarantees to or below the 15 percent level. If such exclusion does not reduce the level to or below the 15 percent level, RUS will notify the borrower in writing that it must reduce or restructure its investments, loans and guarantees to a level of not more than 15 percent of total utility plant. If the borrower does not come within the 15 percent level within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of the required action, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and mortgage.
§ 1717.658
Records, reports and audits.
(a) Every borrower shall maintain accurate records concerning all investments, loans and guarantees made by it. Such records shall be kept in a manner that will enable RUS to readily determine:
(1) The nature and source of all income, expenses and losses generated from the borrower's loans, guarantees and investments;
(2) The location, identity and lien priority of any loan collateral resulting from activities permitted by this subpart; and
(3) The effects, if any, which such activities may have on the feasibility of loans made, guaranteed or lien accommodated by RUS.
(b) In determining the aggregate amount of investments, loans and guarantees made by a borrower, the borrower shall use the recorded value of each investment, loan or guarantee as reflected on its books and records for the next preceding end-of-month, except for the end-of-year report which shall be based on December 31 information. Every borrower shall also report annually to RUS, in the manner and on the form specified by the Administrator, the current status of each investment, outstanding loan and outstanding guarantee which it has made pursuant to this subpart.
(c) The records of borrowers shall be subject to the auditing procedures prescribed in part 1773 of this chapter. RUS reserves the right to review the financial records of any subsidiaries of
the borrower to determine if the borrower is in compliance with this subpart, and to ascertain if the debts, guarantees (as defined in this subpart), or other obligations of the subsidiaries could adversely affect the ability of the borrower to repay its debts to the Government.
(d) RUS will monitor borrower compliance with this subpart based primarily on the annual financial and statistical report submitted by the borrower to RUS and the annual auditor's report on the borrower's operations. However, RUS may inspect the borrower's records at any time during the year to determine borrower compliance. If a borrower's most recent annual financial and statistical report shows the aggregate of the borrower's investments, loans and guarantees to be below the 15 percent level, that in no way relieves the borrower of its obligation to comply with its RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, and this subpart with respect to Administrator approval of any additional investment, loan or guarantee that would cause the aggregate to exceed the 15 percent level.
§ 1717.659
Effect of this subpart on RUS loan contract and mortgage.
(a) Nothing in this subpart shall affect any provision, covenant, or requirement in the RUS mortgage, RUS loan contract, or any other agreement between a borrower and RUS with respect to any matter other than the prior approval by RUS of investments, loans, and guarantees by the borrower, such matters including, without limitation, extensions, additions, and modifications of the borrower's electric system. Also, nothing in this subpart shall affect any rights which supplemental lenders have under the RUS mortgage, or under their loan contracts or other agreements with their borrowers, to limit investments, loans and guarantees by their borrowers to levels below 15 percent of total utility plant.
(b) RUS will require that any electric loan made or guaranteed by RUS after October 23, 1995 shall be subject to a provision in the loan contract or mortgage restricting investments, loans and guarantees by the borrower substantially as follows: The borrower shall not make any loan or advance to, or make any investment in, or purchase or make any commitment to purchase any stock, bonds, notes or other securities of, or guaranty, assume or otherwise become obligated or liable with respect to the obligations of, any other person, firm or corporation, except as permitted by the RE Act and RUS regulations.
(c) RUS reserves the right to change the provisions of the RUS mortgage and loan contract relating to RUS approval of investments, loans and guarantees made by the borrower, on a case-by-case basis, in connection with providing additional financial assistance to a borrower after October 23, 1995.

# Subpart R—Lien Accommodations and Subordinations for 100 Percent Private Financing

# Source:
58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1717.850
General.
(a)
Scope and applicability.
(1) This subpart R establishes policies and procedures for the accommodation, subordination or release of the Government's lien on borrower assets, including approvals of supporting documents and related loan security documents, in connection with 100 percent private sector financing of facilities and other purposes. Policies and procedures regarding lien accommodations for concurrent supplemental financing required in connection with an RUS insured loan are set forth in subpart S of this part.
(2) This subpart and subpart S of this part apply only to debt to be secured under the mortgage, the issuance of
which is subject to the approval of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) by the terms of the borrower's mortgage with respect to the issuance of additional debt or the refinancing or refunding of debt. If RUS approval is not required under such terms of the mortgage itself, a lien accommodation is not required. If the loan contract or other agreement between the borrower and RUS requires RUS approval with respect to the issuance of debt or making additions to or extensions of the borrower's system, such required approvals do not by themselves result in the need for a lien accommodation.
(b)
Overall policy.
(1) Consistent with prudent lending practices, the maintenance of adequate security for RUS's loans, and the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act), it is the policy of RUS to provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in obtaining financing from other lenders by sharing RUS's lien on a borrower's assets in order to finance electric facilities, equipment and systems, and certain other types of community infrastructure. In certain circumstances, RUS may facilitate the financing of such assets by subordinating its lien on specific assets financed by other lenders.
(2) It is also the policy of RUS to provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in promoting rural development by subordinating RUS's lien for financially sound rural development investments under the conditions set forth in § 1717.858.
(c)
Decision factors.
In determining whether to accommodate, subordinate, or release its lien on property pledged by the borrower under the RUS mortgage, RUS will consider the effects of such action on the achievement of the purposes of the RE Act, the repayment and security of RUS loans secured by the mortgage, and other factors set forth in this subpart. The following factors will be considered in assessing the effects on the repayment and security of RUS loans:
(1) The value of the added assets compared with the amount of new debt to be secured;
(2) The value of the assets already pledged under the mortgage, and any effects of the proposed transaction on the value of those assets;
(3) The ratio of the total outstanding debt secured under the mortgage to the value of all assets pledged as security under the mortgage;
(4) The borrower's ability to repay debt owed to the Government, as indicated by the following factors:
(i) Revenues, costs (including interest, lease payments and other debt service costs), margins, Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER), Debt Service Coverage (DSC), and other case-specific economic and financial factors;
(ii) The variability and uncertainty of future revenues, costs, margins, TIER, DSC, and other case-specific economic and financial factors;
(iii) Future capital needs and the ability of the borrower to meet those needs at reasonable cost;
(iv) The ability of the borrower's management to manage and control its system effectively and plan for future needs; and
(5) Other factors that may be relevant in individual cases, as determined by RUS.
(d)
Environmental review requirements.
The environmental review requirements of 7 CFR part 1970 apply to applications for subordinations.
(e)
Co-mortgagees.
Other mortgagees under existing mortgages shared with RUS may have the right to approve requests for lien accommodations, subordinations and releases. In those cases, borrowers would have to obtain the approval of such mortgagees in order for the lien of the mortgage to be accommodated, subordinated or released. Any reference in this subpart to waiving by RUS of any of its rights under the mortgage shall apply only to the rights of RUS and shall not apply to the rights of any other co-mortgagee.
(f)
Safety and performance standards.
(1) To be eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination from RUS, a borrower must comply with RUS standards regarding facility and system planning and design, construction, procurement, and the use of materials accepted by RUS, as required by the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other agreement with RUS, and as further specified in RUS regulations.
(2) RUS “Buy American” requirements shall not apply.
(g)
Advance of funds.
(1) The advance of funds from 100 percent private loans lien accommodated or subordinated by RUS will not be subject to RUS approval. It is the private lender's responsibility to adopt reasonable measures to ensure that such loan funds are used for the purposes for which the loan was made and the lien accommodation or subordination granted. RUS encourages lenders to adopt the following measures:
(i) Remit loan advances to a separate subaccount of the Cash-Construction Fund-Trustee Account;
(ii) Obtain a certification from a registered professional engineer, for each year during which funds from the separate subaccount are utilized by the borrower, that all materials and equipment purchased and facilities constructed during the year from said funds comply with RUS safety and performance standards, as required by paragraph (f) of this section, and are included in an CWP or CWP amendment.
(iii) Obtain an auditor's certification from a Certified Public Accountant, for each year during which funds are advanced to or remitted from the separate subaccount, certifying:
(A) The amount of loan funds advanced to and remitted from the separate subaccount during the period of review;
(B) That based on the auditor's review of construction work orders and other records, all moneys disbursed from the separate subaccount during the period of review were used for purposes contemplated in the loan agreement and the lien accommodation; and
(iv) Immediately notify RUS in writing if the lender is unable to obtain the certifications cited in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
(2) The measures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will normally be sufficient to meet the lender's responsibility provided that additional measures are not reasonably required based on the particular circumstances of an individual case. Should a lender fail to carry out its responsibility in the manner described in this paragraph (g) or in another manner acceptable to RUS, RUS may disqualify such lender from participation in advance approval under §§ 1717.854 and 1717.857 and condition the lender's receipt of a lien accommodation or subordination upon the lender providing satisfactory evidence that it will fulfill its responsibility under this paragraph (g).
(h)
Contracting and procurement procedures.
(1) Facilities financed with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS sources, without an RUS loan guarantee, are not subject to RUS post-loan requirements regarding contracting, procurement and bidding procedures; contract close-out procedures pertaining to project completion, final payment of contractor, and related matters; and standard forms of construction and procurement contracts listed in 7 CFR 1726.300.
(2) To the extent that provisions in a borrower's loan contract or mortgage in favor of RUS may be inconsistent with paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section, paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section are intended to constitute an approval or waiver under the terms of such instruments, and in any regulations implementing such instruments, with respect to facilities financed with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS sources without an RUS guarantee.
(i)
Access of handicapped to buildings and seismic safety.
A borrower must meet the following requirements to be eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of the construction of buildings:
(1) The borrower must provide RUS with a certification by the project architect that the buildings will be designed and constructed in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as applicable under that Act, and that the facilities will be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), (Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101.19, subpart 101-19.6). The certification must be included in the borrower's application for a lien accommodation or subordination. In addition
to these requirements, building construction may also be subject to requirements of The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101
et seq.
); and
(2) The borrower must comply with RUS's seismic safety requirements set forth in 7 CFR part 1792, subpart C.
(j)
Breach of warranty.
Any breach of any warranty or agreement or any material inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, certificate, document, or opinion submitted pursuant to this subpart, including, without limitation, any agreement or representation regarding the use of funds from loans lien accommodated or subordinated pursuant to this subpart, shall constitute a default by the borrower under the terms of its loan agreement with RUS.
(k)
Guaranteed loans.
The provisions of this subpart do not apply to lien accommodations or subordinations sought for loans guaranteed by RUS. Such lien accommodations and subordinations are governed by RUS regulations on guaranteed loans.
(l)
Release of lien.
To avoid repetition, release of lien is not mentioned in every instance where it may be an acceptable alternative to subordination of RUS's lien. Generally, lien subordination is favored over release of lien, and any decision to release RUS's lien is at the sole discretion of RUS.
(m)
Waiver authority.
Consistent with the RE Act and other applicable laws, any requirement, condition, or restriction imposed by this subpart, or subpart S of this part, on a borrower, private lender, or application for a lien accommodation or subordination may be waived or reduced by the Administrator, if the Administrator determines that said action is in the Government's financial interest with respect to ensuring repayment and reasonably adequate security for loans made or guaranteed by RUS.
(n)
Liability.
It is the intent of this subpart that any failure on the part of RUS to comply with any provisions hereof, including without limitation, those provisions setting forth specified timeframes for action by RUS on applications for lien accommodations or lien subordinations, shall not give rise to liability of any kind on the part of the Government or any employees of the Government including, without limitation, liability for damages, fees, expenses or costs incurred by or on behalf of a borrower, private lender or any other party.

It shall be determined by calculating the sum of all loan principal payments, expressed as a fraction of the original loan principal amount, times the number of years and fractions of years elapsed at the time of each payment since issuance of the loan. For example, given a $5 million loan, with a maturity of 5 years and equal principal payments of $1 million due on the anniversary date of the loan, the weighted average life would be: (.2)(1 year) + (.2)(2 years) + (.2)(3 years) + (.2)(4 years) + (.2)(5 years) = .2 years + .4 years + .6 years + .8 years + 1.0 years = 3.0 years. If instead the loan had a balloon payment of $5 million at the end of 5 years, the weighted average life would be: ($5 million/$5 million)(5 years) = 5 years.

§ 1717.852
Financing purposes.
(a)
Purposes eligible.
The following financing purposes, except as excluded in paragraph (b) of this section, are eligible for a lien accommodation from RUS, or in certain circumstances a subordination of RUS's lien on specific assets, provided that all applicable provisions of this subpart are met:
(1) The acquisition, construction, improvement, modification, and replacement (less salvage value) of systems, equipment, and facilities, including real property, used to supply electric and/or steam power to:
(i) RE Act beneficiaries; and/or
(ii) End-user customers of the borrower who are not beneficiaries of the RE Act. Such systems, equipment, and facilities include those listed in 7 CFR 1710.251(c) and 1710.252(c), as well as others that are determined by RUS to be an integral component of the borrower's system of supplying electric and/or steam power to consumers, such as, for example, coal mines, coal handling facilities, railroads and other transportation systems that supply fuel for generation, programs of demand side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems;
(2) The purchase, rehabilitation and integration of existing distribution facilities, equipment and systems, and associated service territory;
(3) The following types of community infrastructure substantially located within the electric service territory of the borrower: water and waste disposal systems, solid waste disposal systems, telecommunication and other electronic communications systems, and natural gas distribution systems;
(4) Front-end costs, when and as the borrower has obtained a binding commitment from the non-RUS lender for the financing required to complete the procurement or construction of the facilities;
(5) Transaction costs included as part of the cost of financing assets or refinancing existing debt, provided, however, that the amount of transaction costs eligible for lien accommodation or subordination normally shall not exceed 5 percent of the principal amount of financing or refinancing provided, net of all transaction costs;
(6) The refinancing of existing debt secured under the mortgage;
(7) Interest during construction of generation and transmission facilities if approved by RUS, case by case, depending on the financial condition of the borrower, the terms of the financing, the nature of the construction, the treatment of these costs by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, and such other factors deemed appropriate by RUS; and
(8) Lien subordinations for certain rural development investments, as provided in § 1717.858.
(b)
Purposes ineligible.
The following financing purposes are not eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination from RUS:
(1) Working capital, including operating funds, unless in the judgment of RUS the working capital is required to ensure the repayment of RUS loans and/or other loans secured under the mortgage;
(2) Facilities, equipment, appliances, or wiring located inside the premises of the consumer, except:
(i) Certain load-management equipment (see 7 CFR 1710.251(c));
(ii) Renewable energy systems and RUS-approved programs of Demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation; and
(iii) As determined by RUS on a case by case basis, facilities included as part of certain cogeneration projects to furnish electric and/or steam power to end-user customers of the borrower;
(3) Investments in a lender required of the borrower as a condition for obtaining financing; and
(4) Debt incurred by a distribution or power supply borrower to finance facilities, equipment or other assets that are not part of the borrower's electric system or one of the four community infrastructure systems cited in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except for certain rural development investments eligible for a lien subordination under § 1717.858.
(c)
Lien subordination for electric utility investments.
RUS will consider subordinating its lien on specific electric utility assets financed by the lender, when the assets can be split off without materially reducing the stability, safety, reliability, operational efficiency, or liquidation value of the rest of the system.
[58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 3986, Jan. 28, 1994; 60 FR 67409, Dec. 29, 1995; 78 FR 73370, Dec. 5, 2013]
§ 1717.853
Loan terms and conditions.
(a)
Terms and conditions.
A loan, bond or other financing instrument, for which a lien accommodation or subordination is requested from RUS, must comply with the following terms and conditions:
(1) The maturity of the loan or bond used to finance facilities or other capital assets must not exceed the weighted average of the expected remaining useful lives of the assets being financed;
(2) The loan or bond must have a maturity of not less than 5 years, except for loans or bonds used to refinance debt that has a remaining maturity of less than 5 years;
(3) The principal of the loan or bond must be amortized at a rate that will yield a weighted average life not greater than the weighted average life that would result from level payments of principal and interest; and
(4) The loan, or any portion of the loan, may bear either a variable (set annually or more frequently) or a fixed interest rate.
(b)
RUS approval.
Loan terms and conditions and the loan agreement between the borrower and the lender are subject to RUS approval. However, RUS will usually waive its right of approval for distribution borrowers that meet the conditions for advance approval of a lien accommodation or subordination set forth in § 1717.854. RUS may also waive its right of approval in other cases. RUS's decision to waive its right of approval will depend on the adequacy of security for RUS's loans, the current and projected financial strength of the borrower and its ability to meet its financial obligations, RUS's familiarity with the lender and its lending practices, whether the transaction is ordinary or unusual, and the uncertainty and credit risks involved in the transaction.
§ 1717.854
Advance approval—100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission and headquarters facilities, and certain other community infrastructure.
(a)
Policy.
Requests for a lien accommodation or subordination from distribution borrowers for 100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission and headquarters facilities, and for community infrastructure listed in § 1717.852(a)(3), qualify for advance approval by RUS if they meet the conditions of this section and all other applicable provisions of this subpart. Advance approval means RUS will approve these requests once RUS is satisfied that the conditions of this section and all other applicable provisions of this subpart have been met.
(b)
Eligible purposes.
Lien accommodations or subordinations for the financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities and community infrastructure listed in § 1717.852(a)(3) are eligible for advance approval, except those that involve the purchase of existing facilities and associated service territory.
(c)

(v) Resolved all outstanding material accounting issues with RUS; and
(vi) Resolved any significant irregularities to RUS's satisfaction; and
(7) If the borrower has a power supply contract with a power supply borrower, the power supply borrower is current on all debt payments and all other financial obligations, and is not in default under the RUS mortgage, the loan contract, any debt restructuring agreement, or any other agreement with RUS.
(d)
Right of normal review reserved.
RUS reserves the right to review any request for lien accommodation or subordination under its normal review process rather than under advance approval procedures if RUS, in its sole discretion, determines there is reasonable doubt as to whether the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section have been or will be met, or whether the borrower will be able to meet all of its present and future financial obligations.
[58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 67410, Dec. 29, 1995; 65 FR 51748, Aug. 25, 2000; 86 FR 36197, July 9, 2021]

§ 1717.857
Refinancing of existing secured debt—distribution and power supply borrowers.
(a)
Advance approval.
All applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for the refinancing of existing secured debt that meet the qualification criteria of this paragraph, except applications from borrowers in default under their mortgage or loan contract with RUS, are eligible for advance approval. Such lien accommodations and subordinations are deemed to be in the Government's interest, and RUS will approve them once RUS is satisfied that the requirements of this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section have been met. The qualification criteria are as follows:
(1) The refinancing is a current refunding and does not involve interest rate swaps, forward delivery contracts, or similar features;
(2) The principal amount of the refinancing loan does not exceed the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the debt being refinanced plus the amount of transactions costs included in the refinancing loan that are eligible for lien accommodation or subordination under § 1717.852(a)(4);
(3) The weighted average life of the refinancing loan is not greater than the weighted average remaining life of the loan being refinanced; and
(4) The present value of the cost of the refinancing loan, including all transaction costs and any required investments in the lender, is less than the present value of the cost of the loan being refinanced, as determined by a method acceptable to RUS. The discount rate used in the present value analysis shall be equal to either:
(i) The current rate on Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the weighted average life of the refunding loan, plus one-eighth percent, or
(ii) A rate approved by RUS based on documentation provided by the borrower as to its marginal long-term borrowing cost.
(b)
Other applications.
Applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will be reviewed by RUS under normal review procedures for these applications. In the case of either advance approval or normal review, a lien subordination would be authorized only if the lien of the mortgage was subordinated with respect to the assets securing the loan being refinanced.
(c)
Application contents—advance approval of refinancing.
Applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing of existing secured debt that meet the qualification criteria for advance approval set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, must include the following information and documents:

(4) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application is received by RUS;
(5) Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment (supplement) required by RUS or the lender, unless RUS has notified the borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself;
(6) A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing instrument, unless RUS has notified the borrower that these documents need not be submitted;
(7) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary
Covered Transactions, as required by 2 CFR part 417:
(8) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the Government's collection options; and
(9) Other information, documents and opinions that RUS may require to determine whether all of the applicable provisions of this subpart have been met.
(d)
Application contents—normal review of refinancing.
Applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for refinancing of existing secured debt that do not meet the requirements for advance approval set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, must include the following information and documents:
(1) The information and documents set forth in paragraphs (c)(3) through (9) of this section;
(2) A complete description of the refinancing loan and the outstanding debt to be refinanced;
(3) An analysis comparing the refinancing loan with the loan being refinanced as to the weighted average life and the net present value of the costs of the two loans; and
(4) If the present value of the cost of the refinancing loan is greater than the present value of the cost of the debt being refinanced, financial forecasts for at least 5 years comparing the borrower's debt service and other costs, revenues, margins, cash flows, TIER, and DSC, with and without the proposed refinancing.
(e)
Application process and timeframes.
The application process and timeframes for RUS review and action for refinancings are set forth in § 1717.859(d).
(f)
Prepayments of concurrent RUS insured loans.
If the loan being refinanced was made concurrently as supplemental financing required by RUS in connection with an RUS insured loan, the refinancing will not be considered a prepayment under the RUS mortgage, and no proportional prepayment of the concurrent RUS insured loan will be required, provided that the principal amount of the refinancing loan is not less than the amount of loan principal being refinanced, and the weighted average life of the refinancing loan is materially equal to the weighted average remaining life of the loan being refinanced. The refinancing loan shall be considered a concurrent loan.
[58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, as amended at 60 FR 67410, Dec. 29, 1995; 79 FR 76003, Dec. 19, 2014; 84 FR 32616, July 9, 2019]
§ 1717.858
Lien subordination for rural development investments.
(a)
Policy.
RUS encourages borrowers to consider investing in financially sound projects that are likely to have a positive effect on economic development and employment in rural areas. In addition to the guidance set forth in § 1717.651, RUS recommends that such investments be made through a subsidiary of the borrower in order to clearly separate the financial risks and the revenues and costs of the rural development enterprise from those of the borrower's electric utility business. This should reduce credit risks to the borrower's primary business, and minimize the possibility of undisclosed cross subsidization of the rural development enterprise by electric rate payers.
(b)
Lien subordination.
RUS will consider subordinating or releasing its lien on the stock held by a borrower in a subsidiary whose primary business directly contributes to or supports economic development and employment in rural areas, as defined in section 13 of the RE Act, when requested by a lender to the subsidiary, other than the borrower. To be eligible for said lien subordination or release:
(1) The borrower must be current on all of its financial obligations and be in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage and loan agreement with RUS; and
(2) In the judgment of RUS, the borrower must be able to repay all of its outstanding debt, and the security for all outstanding loans made to the borrower by RUS, including loans guaranteed by RUS, must be adequate, after taking into account the proposed subordination or release of lien.
(c)
Application contents.
Applications for a lien subordination or release of
lien for rural development investments must include the following information and documents:
(1) A statement from the borrower requesting the lien subordination or release of lien.
(2) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is current on all of its financial obligations and is in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage and loan agreement with RUS;
(3) A description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed and the projected effects on economic development and employment in rural areas;
(4) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application is received by RUS;
(5) If requested by RUS, a long-range financial forecast providing financial projections for at least 10 years, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, which demonstrates that the borrower's system is economically viable and that the borrower will be able to repay all of its outstanding debt and meet all other financial obligations;
(6) A discussion of the borrower's compliance with RUS requirements on accounting, financial reporting, record keeping, and irregularities (see § 1717.854(c)(5)). RUS will review the case and determine the effect of any noncompliance on the feasibility and security of RUS's loans, and whether the requested lien subordination or release of lien can be approved;
(7) If any buildings are to be constructed with the proceeds of the loan to be made to the subsidiary:
(i) A certification by the project architect that the buildings will be designed and constructed in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), as applicable under that Act, and that the facilities will be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards; and
(ii) A written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions of applicable model codes, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104;
(8) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that flood hazard insurance will be obtained for the full value of any buildings, or other facilities susceptible to damage if flooded, that will be located in a flood hazard area;
(9) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions, as required by 2 CFR part 180, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417;
(10) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the Government's collection options; and
(11) Other information that RUS may require to determine whether all of the applicable provisions of this subpart have been met.
[58 FR 53843, Oct. 19, 1993, as amended at 79 FR 76003, Dec. 19, 2014; 84 FR 32616, July 9, 2019]
§ 1717.859
Application process and timeframes.
(a)
General.
(1) Borrowers are responsible for ensuring that their applications for a lien accommodation or subordination are complete and sound as to substance and form before they are submitted to RUS. RUS will not accept any application that, on its face, is incomplete or inadequate as to the substantive information required by this subpart. RUS will notify borrowers in writing when their applications are complete and in form and substance satisfactory to RUS. A copy of all notifications of borrowers cited in this section will also be sent to the private lender.
(2) It is recommended that borrowers consult with RUS staff before submitting their applications to determine whether they will likely qualify for advance approval or normal review, and to obtain answers to any questions about the information and documents required for the application.
(3) A borrower shall, after submitting an application, promptly notify RUS of any changes that materially affect the
information contained in its application.
(4) After submitting an application and having been notified by RUS of additional information and documents and other changes needed to complete the application, if the required information and documents are not supplied to RUS within 30 calendar days of the borrower's receipt of the notice, RUS may return the application to the borrower. The borrower may resubmit the application when the required additional information and documents are available.
(5)
Timeframes.
The timeframes for review of applications set forth in this section are based on the following conditions:
(i) The types of lien accommodations or subordinations requested are of the “standard” types that RUS has approved previously, i.e., the so-called Type I, II and III lien accommodations. Future revisions of the RUS mortgage may result in other “standard” types of lien accommodations and lien subordinations acceptable to RUS. Requests for lien accommodations or subordinations that are substantially different than the “standard” types previously approved by RUS may require additional time for review and action;
(ii) The requested lien accommodation or subordination does not require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement. Preparation of these documents often will require additional time beyond the timeframes cited in this section; and
(iii) The timeframes set forth in this section, except for paragraph (b)(4) of this section, which deals only with approval of a new mortgage or mortgage amendment, include RUS review and/or approval of a loan contract, if required as part of the application, and required supporting documents, such as a CWP.
(b)
Advance approval—100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities.
(1) Applications that qualify under § 1717.854 for advance approval of a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, subtransmission, and headquarters facilities are submitted to the general field representative (GFR). The GFR will work with the borrower to ensure that all components of the application are assembled. Once the application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office for further review and action. If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, a draft of these documents must be included in the application, unless the borrower has been notified that RUS wishes to prepare the documents itself.
(2) If no additional or amended information is needed for RUS to complete its review of the application once it is received in the Washington Office, RUS will, within 45 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office, either:
(i) Approve the lien accommodation or subordination if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactorily to RUS that all requirements of this subpart applicable to advance approval have been met, and send written notice to the borrower. RUS's approval, in this case and all other cases, will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a satisfactory security instrument, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require;
(ii) If all requirements have not been met, so notify the borrower in writing. The application will be returned to the borrower unless the borrower requests that it be reconsidered under the requirements and procedures for normal review set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and in § 1717.856; or
(iii) Send written notice to the borrower explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected.
(3) If additional or amended information is needed after the application is received in the Washington Office, RUS will so notify the borrower in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office. If RUS subsequently becomes aware of other deficiencies in the application, additional written notice will be sent to the borrower. Within 30 calendar days of receiving all of the information required by RUS to complete its review, RUS will act on the application
as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(4) If a new mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, within 30 days of receiving such documents satisfactory to RUS, including required execution counterparts, RUS will execute the documents and send them to the borrower, along with instructions pertaining to recording of the mortgage, an opinion of borrower's counsel, and other matters. RUS will promptly notify the borrower upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the borrower has complied with said instructions.
(c)

—(1)
Distribution borrowers.
(i) Applications from distribution borrowers for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of distribution, transmission, and/or generation facilities (including other eligible electric utility purposes) that do not meet the criteria for advance approval, are also submitted to the GFR. Procedures at this stage are the same as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii) If no additional or amended information is needed for RUS to complete its review of the application once it is received in the Washington office, RUS will, within 90 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington office, send written notice to the borrower either approving the request, disapproving the request, or explaining why a decision cannot be made at that time and giving the estimated date when a decision is expected.
(iii) If additional or amended information is needed after the application is received in the Washington Office, RUS will so notify the borrower in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the application in the Washington Office.

§ 1717.860
Lien accommodations and subordinations under section 306E of the RE Act.
(a)
General.
Under section 306E of the RE Act, when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by a borrower whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal balance of all loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by RUS, the Administrator will, without delay, offer to share the government's
lien on the borrower's system or subordinate the government's lien on the property financed by the private lender, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate. To qualify for a lien accommodation or subordination under this section, the investment must be an original capital investment, i.e., not a refinancing or refunding. (See § 1717.851 for the definition of capital investment.)
(b)
Determination of net worth to RUS debt ratio.
(1) In the case of applications for a lien accommodation, a borrower's net worth will be based on the borrower's most recent financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old at the time the application is received by RUS, and the outstanding debt owed to or guaranteed by RUS will be based on latest RUS records available. The financial and statistical reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers) are subject to RUS review and revision, and they must comply with RUS's system of accounts and accounting principles set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation.
(2) Net worth shall be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of RUS Form 7 for distribution borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of RUS Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined in 7 CFR part 1767.
(c)
Application requirements and process.
(1) If a borrower's net worth to RUS debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by RUS, and the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with RUS, and any other agreement with RUS that have not been exempted in writing by RUS, if requested RUS will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of capital investments, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate. RUS's approval will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to RUS, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.
(2) The application must include the following:
(i) A statement from the borrower requesting the lien accommodation and including the amount and maturity of the proposed loan, a general description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed, the name and address of the lender, and an attached term sheet summarizing the terms and conditions of the proposed loan;
(ii) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with RUS, and any other agreement with RUS that have not been exempted in writing by RUS;
(iii) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the complete application is received by RUS;
(iv) Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment (supplement) required by RUS or the lender, unless RUS has notified the borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself;
(v) A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing instrument, unless RUS has notified the borrower that these documents need not be submitted. These documents will not be subject to RUS approval, but may be reviewed to determine whether they contain any provisions that would result in the security, including assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by RUS no longer being reasonably adequate;
(vi) The following certifications and reports required by law:
(A) The certification by the project architect for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1717.850(i);
(B) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that flood hazard insurance will be obtained for the full value of any buildings, or other facilities susceptible to damage if flooded, that will be located in a flood hazard area;
(C) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions, as required by 2 CFR part 180, adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417;
(D) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower has been informed of the Government's collection options; and
(E) The written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions of applicable model codes for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104. All other elements of an application listed in § 1717.855, § 1717.856, and § 1717.858(c) not listed in this paragraph (c) are exempted.
(3) Applications from distribution borrowers are submitted to the general field representative (GFR), while applications from power supply borrowers are submitted to the RUS Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC. When an application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office. If Washington office staff determine that an application is incomplete, the borrower will be promptly notified in writing about the deficiencies. When the application is complete, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien accommodation or subordination, the borrower and the lender will be promptly notified in writing that the lien accommodation or subornation has been approved, subject to the conditions cited in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Rural development and other non-electric utility investments.
Although RUS recommends the use of separate subsidiaries as set forth in § 1717.858, if requested by a borrower that meets the 110 percent equity test and all other applicable requirements of this section, RUS will provide a lien subordination on the specific assets financed in the case of loans made directly to the borrower for rural development and other non-electric utility purposes, provided that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated under this paragraph (d), after taking into consideration the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination. Investments lien subordinated under this paragraph shall be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent of total utility plant limitation set forth in 7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not constitute approval of the investment under 7 CFR part 1717, subpart N.
(e)
Requirements and controls not exempted.
All requirements and limitations imposed with respect to lien accommodations and subordinations by this subpart R that are not specifically exempted by this section are not exempted and shall continue to apply according to their terms.

# Subpart S—Lien Accommodations for Supplemental Financing Required by 7 CFR 1710.110

# Source:
58 FR 53851, Oct. 19, 1993, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1717.900
Qualification requirements.
Applications for a lien accommodation for supplemental financing required by 7 CFR 1710.110 must meet the same requirements as an RUS insured loan. The justification and documentation materials submitted as part of the borrower's application for an insured loan also serve as the justification and documentation of the request for a lien
accommodation for the required supplemental loan. Unless early approval under § 1717.901 is requested by a borrower, these applications will be processed during the same time as RUS's review of the borrower's application for the concurrent insured loan.
§ 1717.901
Early approval.
(a)
Conditions.
If requested by a borrower in writing, RUS will review the application for a lien accommodation for required supplemental financing early in the process, before funding is available for the concurrent RUS insured loan, and approve the lien accommodation if the following conditions are met:
(1) The required supplemental loan meets the requirements for an insured loan, as set forth in 7 CFR part 1710, subparts A through G, and other RUS regulations pertaining to required supplemental loans;
(2) The borrower has demonstrated the ability to obtain the funds that would be needed to complete other portions of the project, if the portion to be constructed with private loan funds could not be used productively without completion of such other portions, in the event concurrent RUS insured loan funds are not forthcoming. Such evidence may include financial records demonstrating the availability of general funds, and/or a written commitment from the private lender to provide a loan for the remaining amount of financing required, with such commitment being conditioned upon the availability of a lien accommodation from RUS; and
(3) An authorized official of the borrower has requested early approval of the lien accommodation and explained the reasons therefor, and has certified that the funds are needed and will be drawn down before funds from the concurrent insured loan are expected to be available, assuming that the insured loan is approved.
(b)
Timeframe for RUS action.
(1) RUS will either approve or disapprove the lien accommodation within 90 days of receiving the borrower's request for early approval and the complete application for the concurrent RUS loan and required supplemental financing, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, or notify the borrower in writing of the estimated date when a decision is expected. If an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is required, additional time beyond the 90 days may be required to prepare these documents. RUS's approval of the lien accommodation will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a satisfactory security instrument, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.
(2) If a mortgage or mortgage amendment is required, RUS will consult with the other mortgagees as to who will prepare the documents. Within 30 days of obtaining the documents satisfactory to RUS, including required execution counterparts, RUS will execute the documents and send them to the borrower, along with instructions pertaining to recording of the mortgage, an opinion of borrower's counsel, and other matters. RUS will promptly notify the borrower upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the borrower has complied with said instructions.
(c)
Approval of concurrent insured loan.
Early approval of a lien accommodation for a required supplemental loan does not ensure that the concurrent RUS insured loan will be approved. The request for the concurrent insured loan will be reviewed when funds are available to make the loan. The borrower may be requested to update certain supporting information in the loan application if substantial time has elapsed since the lien accommodation or subordination was approved.
§ 1717.902
Other RUS requirements.
Supplemental loans required by 7 CFR 1710.110 are subject to the same post-loan requirements as insured RUS loans regarding accepted materials, construction standards, contracting and procurement procedures, standard forms of contracts, RUS approval of the advance of loan funds, and other matters.
§ 1717.903
Liability.
It is the intent of this subpart that any failure on the part of RUS to comply with any provisions of this subpart, including without limitation, those
provisions setting forth specified timeframes for action by RUS on applications for lien accommodations or lien subordinations, shall not give rise to liability of any kind on the part of the Government or any employees of the Government including, without limitation, liability for damages, fees, expenses or costs incurred by or on behalf of a borrower, private lender or any other party.
§ 1717.904
Exemptions pursuant to section 306E of the RE Act.
(a)
General policy.
If a borrower's net worth to RUS debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by RUS, and the borrower is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with RUS, and any other agreement with RUS that have not been exempted in writing by RUS, RUS will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation for a concurrent supplemental loan if requested in writing by the borrower, provided that the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by RUS will remain reasonably adequate. RUS's approval will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to RUS, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.
(b)
Determination of net worth to RUS debt ratio.
A borrower's ratio of net worth to RUS debt will be determined as set forth in § 1717.860(b).
(c)
Procedures.
If a borrower meets the requirements of this section, upon receipt of a complete application RUS will promptly notify the borrower and lender in writing that the lien accommodation has been approved subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

62 FR 50491, Sept. 26, 1997, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1717.1200
Purpose and scope.
(a) Section 331(b) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (Con Act), as amended on April 4, 1996 by Public Law 104-127, 110 Stat. 888 (7 U.S.C. 1981), grants authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to compromise, adjust, reduce, or charge-off debts or claims arising from loans made or guaranteed under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (RE Act). Section 331(b) of the Con Act also authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust, modify, subordinate, or release the terms of security instruments, leases, contracts, and agreements entered into or administered by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). The Secretary, in 7 CFR 2.47, has delegated authority under section 331(b) of the Con Act to the Administrator of the RUS, with respect to loans made or guaranteed by RUS.
(b) This subpart sets forth the policy and standards of the Administrator of RUS with respect to the settlement of debts and claims arising from loans made or guaranteed to rural electric borrowers under the RE Act. Nothing in this subpart limits the Administrator's authority under section 12 of the RE Act.
§ 1717.1201
Definitions.
Terms used in this subpart that are not defined in this section have the meanings set forth in 7 CFR part 1710. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
Application for debt settlement
means a written application containing all of the information required by § 1717.1204(b)(2), in form and substance satisfactory to RUS.
Attorney General
means the Attorney General of the United States of America.
Claim
means any claim of the government arising from loans made or guaranteed under the RE Act to a rural electric borrower.
Con Act
means the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921
et seq.
).
Debt
means outstanding debt of a rural electric borrower (including, but not necessarily limited to, principal, accrued interest, penalties, and the government's costs of debt collection) arising from loans made or guaranteed under the RE Act.
Enforced collection procedures
means any procedures available to the Administrator for the collection of debt that are authorized by law, in equity, or under the borrower's loan documents or other agreements with RUS.
Loan documents
means the mortgage (or other security instrument acceptable to RUS), the loan contract, and the promissory note entered into between the borrower and RUS.
RE Act
means the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901-950b).
Restructure
means to settle a debt or claim.
Settle
means to reamortize, adjust, compromise, reduce, or charge-off a debt or claim.
§ 1717.1202
General policy.
(a) It is the policy of the Administrator that, wherever possible, all debt owed to the government, including but not limited to principal and interest, shall be collected in full in accordance with the terms of the borrower's loan documents.
(b) Nothing in this subpart by itself modifies, reduces, waives, or eliminates any obligation of a borrower under its loan documents. Any such modifications regarding the debt owed by a borrower may be granted under the authority of the Administrator only by means of the explicit written approval of the Administrator in each case.
(c) The Administrator's authority to settle debts and claims will apply to cases where a borrower is unable to pay its debts and claims in accordance with their terms, as further defined in § 1717.1204(b)(1), and where settlement will maximize, on a present value basis, the recovery of debts and claims owed to the government.
(d) In structuring settlements and determining the capability of the borrower to repay debt and the amount of debt recovery that is possible, the Administrator will consider, among other factors, the RE Act, the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776), the policies and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, state legislative and regulatory actions, and other market and nonmarket forces as to their effects on competition in the electric utility industry and on rural electric systems in particular. Other factors the Administrator will consider are set forth in more detail in § 1717.1204.
§ 1717.1203
Relationship between RUS and Department of Justice.
(a) The Attorney General will be notified by the Administrator whenever the Administrator intends to use his or her authority under section 331(b)of the Con Act to settle a debt or claim.
(b) If an outstanding claim has been referred in writing to the Attorney General, the Administrator will not use his or her own authority to settle the claim without the approval of the Attorney General.
(c) If an application for additional debt relief is received from a borrower whose debt has been settled in the past under the authority of the Attorney General, the Administrator will promptly notify the Attorney General before proceeding to consider the application.
§ 1717.1204
Policies and conditions applicable to settlements.
(a)
General.
Settlement of debts and claims shall be subject to the policies, requirements, and conditions set forth in this section and in § 1717.1202.
(b)
Need for debt settlement.
(1) The Administrator will not settle any debt
or claim unless the Administrator has determined that the borrower is unable to meet its financial obligations under its loan documents according to the terms of those documents, or that the borrower will not be able to meet said obligations sometime within the period of 24 months following the month the borrower submits its application for debt settlement to RUS, and, in either case, such default is likely to continue indefinitely. The determination of a borrower's ability to meet its financial obligations will be based on analyses and documentation by RUS of the borrower's historical, current, and projected costs, revenues, cash flows, assets, opportunities to reduce costs and/or increase revenues, and other factors that may be relevant on a case by case basis.
(2) In its application to RUS for debt settlement, the borrower must provide, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, an in-depth analysis supporting the borrower's contention that it is unable or will not be able to meet its financial obligations as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The analysis must include:
(i) An explanation and analysis of the causes of the borrower's inability to meet its financial obligations;
(ii) A thorough review and analysis of the opportunities available or potentially available to the borrower to reduce administrative overhead and other costs, improve efficiency and effectiveness, and expand markets and revenues, including but not limited to opportunities for sharing services, merging, and/or consolidating, raising rates when appropriate, and renegotiating supplier and service contracts. In the case of a power supply borrower, the study shall include such opportunities among the members of the borrower, unless the Administrator waives this requirement;
(iii) Documentation of the actions taken, in progress, or planned by the borrower (and its member systems, if applicable) to take advantage of the opportunities cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; and
(iv) Other analyses and documentation prescribed by RUS on a case by case basis.
(3) RUS may require that an independent consultant provide an analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of the borrower's organization and operations, and those of its member systems in the case of a power supply borrower. The following conditions will apply:
(i) RUS will select the independent consultant taking into account, among other matters, the consultant's experience and expertise in matters relating to electric utility operations, finance, and restructuring;
(ii) The contract with the consultant shall be to provide services to RUS on such terms and conditions as RUS deems appropriate. The consultant's scope of work may include, but shall not be limited to, an analysis of the following:
(A) How to maximize the value of the government's collateral, such as through mergers, consolidations, or sales of all or part of the collateral;
(B) The viability of the borrower's system, taking into account such matters as system size, service territory and markets, asset base, physical condition of the plant, operating efficiency, competitive pressures, industry trends, and opportunities to expand markets and improve efficiency and effectiveness;
(C) The feasibility and the potential benefits and risks to the borrower and the government of corporate restructuring, including aggregation and disaggregation;
(D) In the case of a power supply borrower, the retail rate mark-up by member systems and the potential benefits to be achieved by member restructuring through mergers, consolidations, shared services, and other alliances;
(E) The quality of the borrower's management, management advisors, consultants, and staff;
(F) Opportunities for reducing overhead and other costs, for expanding markets and revenues, and for improving the borrower's existing and prospective contractual arrangements for the purchase and sale of power, procurement of supplies and services, and the operation of plant and facilities;
(G) Opportunities to achieve efficiency gains and increased revenues
based on comparisons with benchmark electric utilities; and
(H) The accuracy and completeness of the borrower's analysis provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(iii) RUS and, as appropriate, other creditors, will determine the extent to which the borrower and third parties (including the members of a power supply borrower) will be required to participate in funding the costs of the independent consultant;
(iv) The borrower will be required to make available to the consultant all corporate documents, files, and records, and to provide the consultant with access to key employees. The borrower will also normally be required to provide the consultant with office space convenient to the borrower's operations and records; and
(v) All analyses, studies, opinions, memoranda, and other documents and information produced by the independent consultant shall be provided to RUS on a confidential basis for consideration in evaluating the borrower's application for debt settlement. Such documents and information may be made available to the borrower and other appropriate parties if authorized in writing by RUS.
(4) The borrower may be required to employ a temporary or permanent manager acceptable to the Administrator, to manage the borrower's operations to ensure that all actions are taken to avoid or minimize the need for debt settlement. The employment could be on a temporary basis to manage the system during the time the debt settlement is being considered, and possibly for some time after any debt settlement, or it could be on a permanent basis.
(5) The borrower must submit, at a time determined by RUS, a resolution of its board of directors requesting debt settlement and stating that the borrower is either currently unable to meet its financial obligations to the government or will not be able to meet said obligations sometime within the next 24 months, and that, in either case, the default is likely to continue indefinitely.
(c)
Debt settlement measures.
(1) If the Administrator determines that debt settlement is appropriate, the debt settlement measures the Administrator will consider under this subpart with respect to direct, insured, or guaranteed loans include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Reamortization of debt;
(ii) Extension of debt maturity, provided that the maturity of the borrower's outstanding debt after settlement shall not extend more than 10 years beyond the latest maturity date prior to settlement;
(iii) Reduction of the interest rate charged on the borrower's debt, provided that the interest rate on any portion of the restructured debt shall not be reduced to less than 5 percent, unless the Administrator determines that reducing the rate below 5 percent would maximize debt recovery by the government;
(iv) Forgiveness of interest accrued, penalties, and costs incurred by the government to collect the debt; and
(v) With the concurrence of the Under Secretary for Rural Development, forgiveness of loan principal.
(2) In the event that RUS has, under section 306 of the RE Act, guaranteed loans made by the Federal Financing Bank or other third parties, the Administrator may restructure the borrower's obligations by: acquiring and restructuring the guaranteed loan; restructuring the loan guarantee obligation; restructuring the borrower's reimbursement obligations; or by such means as the Administrator deems appropriate, subject to such consents and approvals, if any, that may be required by the third party lender.
(d)
Borrower's obligations to other creditors.
The Administrator will not grant relief on debt owed to the government unless similar relief, on a pro rata basis, is granted with respect to other secured obligations of the borrower, or the other secured creditors provide other benefits or value to the debt restructuring. Unsecured creditors will also be expected to contribute to the restructuring. If it is not possible to obtain the expected contributions from other creditors, the Administrator may proceed to settle a borrower's debt if that will maximize recovery by the government and will not result in material benefits accruing to
other creditors at the expense of the government.
(e)
Competitive bids for system assets.
If requested by RUS, the borrower or the independent consultant provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall solicit competitive bids from potential buyers of the borrower's system or parts thereof. The bidding process must be conducted in consultation with RUS and use standards and procedures acceptable to RUS. The Administrator may use the competitive bids received as a basis for requiring the sale of all or part of the borrower's system as a condition of settlement of the borrower's debt. The Administrator may also consider the bids in evaluating alternative settlement measures.
(f)
Valuation of system.
(1) The Administrator will consider the value of the borrower's system, including, in the case of a power supply borrower, the wholesale power contracts between the borrower and its member systems. The valuation of the wholesale power contracts shall take into account, among other matters, the rights of the government and/or third parties, to assume the rights and obligations of the borrower under such contracts, to charge reasonable rates for service provided under the contracts, and to otherwise enforce the contracts in accordance with their terms. In no case will the Administrator settle a debt or claim for less than the value (after considering the government's collection costs) of the borrower's system and other collateral securing the debt or claim.
(2) RUS may use such methods, analyses, and assessments as the Administrator deems appropriate to determine the value of the borrower's system.
(g)
Rates.
The Administrator will consider the rates charged for electric service by the borrower and, in the case of a power supply borrower, by its members, taking into account, among other factors, the practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), as adapted to the cooperative structure of borrowers, and, where applicable, FERC treatment of any investments by co-owners in projects jointly owned by the borrower.
(h)
Collection action.
The Administrator will consider whether a settlement is favorable to the government in comparison with the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures.
(i)
Regulatory approvals.
Before the Administrator will approve a settlement, the borrower must provide satisfactory evidence that it has obtained all approvals required of regulatory bodies that the Administrator determines are needed to implement rates or other provisions of the settlement, or that are needed in any other way for the borrower to fulfill its obligations under the settlement.
(j)
Conditions regarding management and operations.
As a condition of debt settlement, the borrower, and in the case of a power supply borrower, its members, will be required to implement those changes in structure, management, operations, and performance deemed necessary by the Administrator. Those changes may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The borrower may be required to undertake a corporate restructuring and/or sell a portion of its plant, facilities, or other assets
(2) The borrower may be required to replace senior management and/or hire outside experts acceptable to the Administrator. Such changes may include a commitment by the borrower's board of directors to restructure and/or obtain new membership to improve board oversight and leadership;
(3) The borrower may be required to agree to:
(i) Controls by RUS on the general funds of the borrower, as well as on any investments, loans or guarantees by the borrower, notwithstanding any limitations on RUS' control rights in the borrower's loan documents or RUS regulations; and
(ii) Requirements deemed necessary by RUS to perfect and protect its lien on cash deposits, securities, equipment, vehicles, and other items of real or non-real property; and
(4) In the case of a power supply borrower, the borrower may be required to obtain credit support from its member systems, as well as pledges and action plans by the members to change their operations, management, and organizational structure (e.g., shared services, mergers, or consolidations) in order to
reduce operating costs, improve efficiency, and/or expand markets and revenues.
(k)
Conveyance of assets.
As a condition of a settlement, a borrower may be required to convey some or all its assets to the government.
(l)
Additional conditions.
The borrower will be required to warrant and agree that no bonuses or similar extraordinary compensation has been or will be provided, for reasons related to the settlement of government debt, to any officer or employee of the borrower or to other persons or entities identified by RUS. The Administrator may impose such other terms and conditions of debt settlement as the Administrator determines to be in the government's interests.
(m)
Certification of accuracy.
Before the Administrator will approve a debt settlement, the manager or other appropriate official of the borrower must certify that all information provided to the government by the borrower or by any agent of the borrower, in connection with the debt settlement, is true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
§ 1717.1205
Waiver of existing conditions on borrowers.
Pursuant to section 331(b) of the Con Act, the Administrator, at his or her sole discretion, may waive or otherwise reduce conditions and requirements imposed on a borrower by its loan documents if the Administrator determines that such action will contribute to enhancement of the government's recovery of debt. Such waivers or reductions in conditions and requirements under this section shall not include the exercise of any of the debt settlement measures set forth in § 1717.1204(c), which are subject to all of the requirements of said § 1717.1204.
§ 1717.1206
Loans subsequent to settlement.
In considering any future loan requests from a borrower whose debt has been settled in whole or in part (including the surviving entity of merged or consolidated borrowers, where at least one of said borrowers had its debts settled), it will be presumed that credit support for the full amount of the requested loan will be required. Such support may be in a number of forms, provided that they are acceptable to the Administrator on a case by case basis. They may include, but need not be limited to, equity infusions and guarantees of debt repayment, either from the applicant's members (in the case of a power supply borrower), or from a third party.
§ 1717.1207
RUS obligations under loan guarantees.
Nothing in this subpart affects the obligations of RUS under loan guarantee commitments it has made to the Federal Financing Bank or other lenders.
§ 1717.1208
Government's rights under loan documents.
Nothing in this subpart limits, modifies, or otherwise affects the rights of the government under loan documents executed with borrowers, or under law or equity.

§ 1718.50
Definitions.
Unless otherwise indicated, terms used in this subpart are defined as set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2.
§ 1718.51
Policy.
(a) Adequate loan security must be provided for loans made or guaranteed by RUS. The loans are required to be secured by a first mortgage lien on most of the borrower's assets substantially in the form set forth in appendix A of this subpart. At the discretion of RUS, this model form of mortgage may be adapted to satisfy different legal requirements among the states and individual differences in lending circumstances, provided that such adaptations are consistent with the policies set forth in this subpart.
(b) Some borrowers, such as certain public power districts, may not be able to provide security in the form of a first mortgage lien on their assets. In these cases RUS will consider accepting other forms of security, such as resolutions and pledges of revenues.
(c) RUS may require supplemental and amending mortgages to protect its security, or in connection with additional loans.
(d) RUS may also require such other security instruments (such as loan contracts, security agreements, financing statements, guarantees, and pledges) as it deems appropriate.
(e) All distribution borrowers that receive a loan or loan guarantee from RUS on or after August 17, 1995 will be required to enter into a mortgage with RUS that meets the requirements of this subpart. The concurrence of any other lenders secured under the borrower's existing mortgage may be required before the borrower can enter into a new mortgage.
§ 1718.52
Existing mortgages.
Nothing contained in this subpart amends, invalidates, terminates or rescinds any existing mortgage entered into between the borrower and RUS and any other mortgagees.
§ 1718.53
Rights of other mortgagees.
Nothing contained in this subpart is intended to alter or affect any other mortgagee's rights under an existing mortgage.
§ 1718.54
Availability of model mortgage.
Single copies of the model mortgage (RUS Informational Publication 1718 B) are available from the Rural Utilities Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1500. This document may be reproduced.

# Subpart C—Loan Contracts With Distribution Borrowers

# Source:
60 FR 67410, Dec. 29, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1718.100
General.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the policies, requirements, and procedures governing loan contracts entered into between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and distribution borrowers or, in some cases, other electric borrowers.
(b)
Flexibility for individual circumstances.
The intent of this subpart is to provide the flexibility to address the different needs and different credit risks of individual borrowers, and other special circumstances of individual lending situations. The model loan contract contained in appendix A of this subpart provides an example of what a loan contract with an “average” or “typical” distribution borrower may look like under “average” or “typical” circumstances. Depending on the credit risks and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may execute loan contracts with provisions that are substantially different than those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model loan contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made available to the public.
(c)
Resolution of any differences in contractual provisions.
If any provision of
the loan contract appears to be in conflict with provisions of the mortgage, the loan contract shall have precedence with respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect to such provision. If either document is silent on a matter addressed in the other document, the other document shall have precedence with respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect to such matter.
(d)
Certain loan contract provisions subject to subsequent rulemaking.
If a loan contract provision imposes an obligation or limitation on the borrower whose interpretation or specification is subject to RUS regulations or the discretion of the Administrator or RUS, such interpretation or specification shall be subject to subsequent rulemaking. Such interpretation or specification of the borrower's obligations or limitations may not exceed the authority granted to the Administrator or RUS in the loan contract provision.
§ 1718.101
Applicability.
(a)
Distribution borrowers.
The provisions of this subpart apply to all distribution borrowers that obtain a loan or loan guarantee from RUS approved on or after January 29, 1996. Distribution borrowers that obtain a lien accommodation or any other form of financial assistance from RUS after January 29, 1996, may be required to execute a new loan contract and new mortgage. Moreover, any distribution borrower may submit a request to RUS that a new loan contract and new mortgage be executed. Within the constraints of time and staff resources, RUS will attempt to honor such requests. Borrowers must first obtain the concurrence of any other mortgagees on their existing mortgage before a new mortgage can be executed.
(b)
Other borrowers.
Borrowers other than distribution borrowers may also submit requests for execution of a new loan contract pursuant to this subpart and a new mortgage pursuant to subpart B of this part. RUS may approve such requests if it determines that such approval is in the government's financial interest. If other mortgagees are on the borrower's existing mortgage, their concurrence would be required before a new mortgage could be executed.
§ 1718.102
Definitions.
For the purposes of this subpart:
Borrower
means any organization that has an outstanding loan made or guaranteed by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) or its predecessor, the Rural Electrification Administration, for rural electrification, or that is seeking such financing.
Distribution borrower
means a borrower that sells or intends to sell electric power and energy at retail in rural areas, the latter being defined in 7 CFR 1710.2.
Loan documents
means the mortgage (or other security instrument acceptable to RUS), the loan contract, and the promissory note entered into between the borrower and RUS.
§ 1718.103
Loan contract provisions.
Loan contracts executed pursuant to this subpart shall contain such provisions as RUS determines are appropriate to further the purposes of the RE Act and to ensure that the security for the loan will be reasonably adequate and that the loan will be repaid according to the terms of the promissory note. Such loan contracts will contain provisions addressing, but not necessarily limited to, the following matters:
(a) Description of the purpose of the loan;
(b) Specification of the interest to be charged on the loan, including the method for determining the interest rate if it is not fixed for the entire term of the loan;
(c) Specification of the method for repaying the loan principal, including the final maturity of the loan;
(d) The conditions under which the loan may be prepaid before its maturity date, including but not limited to requirements regarding the prepayment of loans made concurrently by RUS and another secured lender;
(e) The method for making scheduled payments on the loan;

§ 1719.6
Agency review.
(a)
General.
Loans made under this program will be made only when the Administrator finds and certifies that in his or her judgment there is reasonably adequate security and the loan will be repaid within the time agreed.
(b)
Eligibility for other loans.
RUS will not include any debt incurred by a borrower under this program in the calculation of the debt-equity ratios of the borrower for purposes of eligibility for loans under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901
et seq.
).
(c)

Eligibility of the proposed EE Program or project.
(3)
Financial status.
The financial status of the RESP applicant to determine the Applicant's likelihood to complete a loan application and successfully repay a RESP loan.
(d)
Loan application.
Prudent lending practices require that the Administrator make certain findings prior to approving a RESP loan. RESP applicants must provide the evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, to be able to make such findings. In making loans under this Section, the Administrator will consider, including, but not limited to, the following factors:
(1)
Loan feasibility.
The RESP applicant's ability to repay the loan in full as scheduled and all other obligations of the borrower will be met.

(5)
Loan security.
The RESP applicant's assets pledged to secure the loan. Collateral will be assessed for each applicant taking into consideration asset value, lien position, credit risk and borrower's profile. Collateral pledged should be adequate to protect the Government's interest. RUS reserves the right to require an asset appraisal.
(6)
EE program implementation and measurement and verification.
RESP applicant's IWP must be based on reasonable assumptions and adequate supporting data and the M
V plan reasonably complies with § 1719.10. However, the Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, may deem this requirement satisfied upon finding that the IWP and M
V plan from an existing EE Program as of April 8, 2014 is consistent with the purpose of the Rural Energy Savings Program. A RESP applicant with an existing EE Program as of April 8, 2014, may submit the M
V plan previously established to fulfill this requirement.
§ 1719.7
Conditional commitment letter and loan closing.
(a)
Conditional commitment letter.
A successful RESP loan applicant will receive a Conditional commitment letter from the Administrator notifying the RESP applicant of the total loan amount approved by RUS; any additional controls on the its financial, investment, operational and managerial activities; acceptable security arrangements; and such other conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to adequately secure the Government's interest, ensure repayment, and abide by the RESP requirements as outlined in this Part. This written notification is a conditional RESP loan offer.
(1) The requirements for coverage ratios will be set forth in the Conditional commitment letter.
(2) Receipt of a Conditional commitment letter from the Administrator does not authorize the RESP applicant to commence performance under the approved loan.
(b)
Intent to meet conditions.
The RESP applicant must acknowledge receipt of the Conditional commitment letter and notify RUS in writing within 60 days or otherwise specified in the Conditional commitment letter that it has reviewed and understood the conditions set forth in the Conditional commitment letter and that it is the intent of the RESP applicant to meet all the conditions. The RESP applicant must promptly notify RUS should circumstances or its intent of meeting the conditions change. The Administrator may consider requests to amend the conditions and amend the conditions in a subsequent Conditional commitment letter, when it advances program and policy goals and is in the best interest of the Government.
(c)
Loan closing.
The loan will be closed in accordance with RUS instructions.
(1) Upon receipt of the acceptance of the loan offer from the RESP applicant, RUS, working with its legal counsel, will draft the loan documents which will include the loan conditions and other applicable legal requirements.
(2) The loan documents will be forwarded to the RESP applicant by RUS for execution by the RESP applicant's signatories and returned to RUS prior to a mutually acceptable closing date. RUS reserves the right to unilaterally set a closing date to advance program and policy goals.
(3) The loan closing date will be used to determine the RESP loan maturity date which under no circumstances will exceed 20 years.
(4) An opinion of counsel is required at closing and must be in form and substance acceptable to the Administrator. A form opinion of counsel will be included in the closing instructions.
(d)
Post-closing activities.
All RUS requirements and conditions for lending set forth in the loan agreement must
be met before the loan will be advanced. RUS will notify the RUS borrower when it is authorized to commence activities to be funded by the RESP loan.
§ 1719.8
Loan provisions.
(a)
Financial ratios.
The Administrator will set financial coverage ratios based on the risk profile of the RESP applicant and specific loan terms. Those financial ratios will be included in the RESP borrower's loan documents with RUS.
(1) Unless otherwise notified, existing RUS borrowers will be subject to their current debt service coverage ratios as provided in their previously executed loan contracts with RUS.
(2) The minimum coverage ratio required for RESP borrowers, whether applied on annual or average basis is 1.05 Debt Service Coverage (DSC) unless specifically waived by the Administrator.
(3) DSC for RESP borrowers that are not existing RUS borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act will be defined as (Net Income or Total Margins) + (Interest Charges on Long Term Debt) + (Principal payments from RESP relending activities) + (Depreciation and Amortization Expenses)/Total Debt Service Billed.
(4) In reviewing and approving a RESP loan, the Administrator may increase the coverage ratio required to be met by an individual RESP borrower if the Administrator determines that higher ratios are required to ensure the repayment of the loan made by RUS, or reduce the coverage ratios if the Administrator determines that the lower ratios are in the best interest of the Government. The coverage ratios will be set forth in the loan documents.
(b)
Collateral.
RUS generally requires that borrowers provide it with a first priority lien on all of the borrower's real and personal property, including intangible personal property and any property acquired after the date of the loan. Collateral that is used to secure a loan must ordinarily be free from liens or security interests other than those permitted by RUS or existing security documents.
(1) For existing RUS borrowers, the Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, rely on existing security arrangements with RUS.
(2) When a RESP borrower is unable, by reason of preexisting encumbrances, or otherwise, to furnish a first priority lien on its entire system, the Administrator may accept other forms of security, including but not limited to a parent guarantee, state guarantee, an irrevocable letter of credit, surety bond, pledge of revenues, or other security if the Administrator determines such credit support is reasonably adequate to protect the government's interests and otherwise acceptable in form and substance.
(3) RUS may in certain circumstances agree to share its priority lien position with another lender provided the RESP loan is adequately secured and the security arrangements are acceptable to RUS. In such circumstances, RUS will consider entering into joint security arrangements with other lenders on a
pari passu
basis.
(c)
Equity contributions.
To be eligible for a RESP loan, a newly created Eligible entity or an entity primarily owned or controlled by one (1) or more entities as described in § 1719.4 must meet a minimum equity contribution in the proposed EE Program requirement at the time of the loan closing. The eligible entity will be required to continue to maintain the minimum equity contribution for the life of the loan or other time period as determined by the Administrator and as set forth in the loan documents. The minimum acceptable equity contribution for each RESP borrower will be determined by the Administrator as set forth below and will be included in the Conditional commitment letter and the loan documents as a condition and covenant to the RESP loan.
(1) The required equity contribution and related terms will be determined by the Administrator for the individual RESP applicant based upon the its risk profile and available collateral for the RESP loan.
(2) RUS reserves the right to require additional equity contributions from existing RUS or RESP borrowers when it is in the best interest of the Government.
(3) If the RESP applicant under this section is unable to achieve a minimal acceptable contribution, as set forth in the Conditional commitment letter, the Administrator may consider the following to meet such shortfall to the minimum acceptable equity contribution:
(i) The infusion of additional capital into the EE Program by an Investor to meet the shortfall to the minimum acceptable equity contribution. RUS may require that the additional capital be deposited into a RESP applicant's special account subject to a deposit account control agreement with RUS prior to loan closing.
(ii) An unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, in the amount necessary to meet the shortfall to the minimum acceptable equity contribution. RUS must be an unconditional payee under the letter of credit and the letter of credit must be in place prior to loan closing and remain in place until the loan is repaid unless specified otherwise in the loan documents.
(iii) General obligation bonds or special revenue bonds issued by tribal, state or local governments in the amount necessary to meet the shortfall to the minimum acceptable equity contribution. If the minimum acceptable equity position is satisfied in full or part with general obligation bonds or special revenue bonds, any lien securing the bonds must be subordinate to the lien of the Government securing the RESP loan.
(iv) Any other requirements or mechanisms approved by the Administrator to meet the shortfall to the minimum acceptable equity contribution.
(d)
Loan advances.
RUS will disburse loan funds to the RESP borrower in accordance with the terms and conditions of the executed loan documents.
(1) Excluding the Special Advance, all loan funds will be disbursed either as an advance in anticipation of loans to be made by the RESP borrower to the Qualified consumers; or as a reimbursement for eligible program costs, including loans already made to Qualified consumers. No disbursements will be made until the RESP borrower has complied with the loan conditions set forth in the loan documents. Any disbursement of loan funds to a RESP borrower within a 12-month consecutive period must not exceed 50 percent of the approved loan amount.
(i) The RESP borrower must provide to the Qualified consumers all RESP loan funds that the RESP borrower receives within one year of receiving them from RUS. If the RESP borrower does not re-lend the RESP loan funds within one year, the unused RESP loan funds, and any interest earned on those RESP loan funds, must be returned to the Government and will be applied to the RESP borrower's debt.
(ii) The RESP borrower will not be eligible to receive additional RESP loan funds from RUS until providing evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, that RESP loan funds from a previous advance have been fully relent to Qualified consumers or returned to the Government.
(iii) RUS will disburse the RESP loan funds as an advance in anticipation of loans to be made by the RESP borrower to the Qualified consumers only if the RESP borrower has established written procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of RESP loan funds from RUS to the RESP borrower and its corresponding disbursement to the Qualified consumer.
(iv) A RESP borrower's request for an advance in anticipation of loans to Qualified consumers should be limited to the minimum amounts needed and timed to be in accordance with the actual immediate cash needs to carry out the EE Program.
(2) The RESP borrower may elect to request a Special advance to defray the appropriate start-up costs of establishing a new EE Program or modify an existing EE Program.
(i) The Special advance must not exceed 4 percent of the total approved loan amount.
(ii) Repayment of the Special advance must be required during the 10-year period beginning on the date on which the Special advance is made.
(iii) The RESP borrower may elect to defer the repayment of the Special advance to the end of the 10-year period.
(iv) All Special advances must be made during the first 10-years of the term of the loan.
(v) All amounts advanced on the loan by RUS to the RESP borrower, including the Special advance, must be paid prior to the final maturity which must not exceed 20 years.
(vi) The Special advance maximum amount must be requested by the Borrower and approved by RUS prior to loan closing.
(e)
Loans to Qualified Consumers.
RUS borrowers loans to Qualified Consumers will be subject to the following terms and for the purposes listed below.
(1) RESP borrower's loans to its Qualified consumers must be for the purpose of implementing EE measures.
(2) Loans to Qualified consumers may bear interest not to exceed 5 percent.
(3) Each loan made by the RESP borrower to a Qualified consumer may not exceed a term of 10 years.
(4) The EE measures financed with a RESP loan proceeds must be for the purpose of decreasing energy (not just electricity) usage or costs of the Qualified consumer by an amount that ensures, to the maximum extent practicable, that a loan term of not more than 10 years will not pose an undue financial burden on the Qualified consumer.
(5) RESP loan proceeds must not be used to fund purchases of, or modifications to, personal property unless the personal property is or becomes attached to real property (including a manufactured home) as a fixture.
(6) Loans made to Qualified consumers must be repaid through charges added to the recurring service bill for the property for, or, at which the EE measures have been or will be implemented. This requirement does not prohibit the voluntary prepayment of the loan by the owner of the property; or the use of any additional repayment mechanisms that are demonstrated to have appropriate risk mitigation measures, as determined by the RESP borrower, or required if the Qualified consumer is no longer a customer of the RESP Borrower.
(7) Loans made by a RESP borrower to a Qualified consumer using RESP loan funds must require an Energy audit by the RESP borrower to determine the impact of the proposed EE measures on the energy costs and consumption of the Qualified consumer. For purposes of this section, an energy audit performed by a contractor or agent of the RESP borrower would be deemed as performed by the RESP borrower.
(8) The RESP borrower must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations in making loans to Qualified consumers. Approval by RUS and its employees of a loan under this section does not constitute a Government endorsement. The Government and its employees assume no legal liability for the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, product, service, or process funded directly or indirectly with financial assistance provided under RESP. Nothing in the loan documents between RUS and the RESP borrower will confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever. Neither the Government nor its employees make any warranty, express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to any information, product, service, or process available from a RESP borrower or its agents.
(f)

(1) The RESP loans under this section will bear no interest (0 percent) and have a maturity not exceeding 20 years.
(2) The amortization schedule must be based on a loan term that does not exceed 20 years from the date on which the loan is closed.
(3) Except for the Special advance, the repayment of each advance must be amortized for a period not to exceed 10 years.
(4) The Administrator may include additional conditions on the repayment schedule if, in his or her sole discretion, it is in the best interest of the Government.
(5) The RESP borrower is responsible for fully repaying the RESP loan to RUS according to the loan documents
regardless of repayment by its Qualified consumers.
(6) The RESP borrower may use the revenues from the interest charged to the Qualified consumer to establish a loan loss reserve, and to offset personnel and EE Program costs.
(7) Loans under this Section will not bear interest (0 percent), however, indebtedness not paid when due will be subject to interest, penalties, administrative costs and late fees as provided in the loan documents.

§ 1719.10
Measurement and verification and quality control.
(a)
General.
A RESP applicant must provide a Measurement and Verification (M
V) plan, satisfactory to the Administrator, to ensure the effectiveness of the energy efficiency loans made to its Qualified Consumers and that there is no conflict of interest in carrying out the EE Program.
(1) RUS acknowledges the broad nature of energy efficiency projects and diverse scope of EE Programs that can be carried out under RESP. A RESP applicant, and its designees, must exercise professional judgment in developing their M
V plans. The nature, scope, and complexity of the EE measures and activities will dictate the level of effort needed for quantifying and verifying the savings. The effort expended should be commensurate with the project capital investment and the risk of miscalculating the savings.
(2) A RESP applicant with an existing EE Program as of April 8, 2014, may submit for consideration the M
V plan previously established to fulfill this requirement.
(3) RUS may reject a loan application or refuse to disburse loan proceeds to an RESP borrower that fails to demonstrate that the Energy audits or M
V plan have been adequately implemented and performed by qualified individuals.
(4) The M
V plan should be based on generally accepted principles and use the best practices of the industry, reliable data, reasonable assumptions and verifiable analytical methodologies.
(5) The M
V plan must describe the organized activities that the RESP applicant will implement to facilitate the adoption of the Energy efficiency measures that will result in energy use or cost savings to the Qualified consumer.
(6) Energy savings should be determined by comparing measured energy unit values (consumption or demand) before and after the implementation of the EE measures, making appropriate adjustments for changes in conditions.
(7) The computation of the savings formula is as follow:
Savings = (Baseline Energy—Post-Installation of EE Measures Energy*) ± Adjustments
Note: * = performance period
(b)
M
V Techniques for measuring, calculating and reporting savings.
The RESP borrower may address the M
V requirements by applying any of the following techniques recognized in the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol.
(1) The Retrofit Isolation with Key Parameter Measurement Option (RIKPM) alternative is based on a combination of measured and estimated factors. Measurements will be taken at the component or system level for both the baseline and the retrofit equipment and should include the key performance parameters that define the energy use of the energy conservation measure. Savings will be determined by calculating the baseline and reporting period energy use predicated on the measured and estimated values. Estimated values will have to be supported by historical or manufacturer's data.
(2) The Retrofit Isolation with All Parameter Measurement Option (RIAPM) option will be based on short-term, periodic or continuous measurements of baseline and post-retrofit energy use (or proxies of energy use) taken at the component or system level. Savings will be based on the analysis of the baseline and reporting-period energy use or proxies of energy use.
(3) The Whole Facility Measurement Option (WFMO) will be based on continuous measurement of the energy use (such as utility billing data) at the whole facility or sub-facility level during the baseline and post-retrofit periods. Savings will be established from the analysis of the baseline and reporting-period energy data.
(4) The Calibrated Simulation Option (CSO) is an alternative where computer
simulations can be used to model energy performance of a whole facility (or sub-facility). Models must be calibrated with actual hourly or monthly billing data from the facility. In this option, savings will be determined by comparing a simulation of the baseline (after having calibrated the model) with either a simulation of the performance period or actual utility data.
(c)
Use of deemed savings.
A RESP applicant may elect to meet the M
V plan requirements by applying deemed savings values and calculations. If choosing this option, the RESP applicant's M
V plan must:
(1) Describe the process to stipulate with the Qualified consumer the values and assumptions for determining the energy savings.
(2) Identify the TRMs upon which the deemed savings values and assumptions are based. In the alternative, identify such other technical M
V studies reasonably applicable to the conditions of the RESP applicant's service area or such other detailed M
V studies performed by similar entities to determine deemed savings for identical or similar energy programs or energy efficiency measures.
(3) Describe the mechanism to ensure that deemed savings values and related calculations will be maintained and kept up to date.
(4) The approval by RUS of a M
V plan under this section is solely for the benefit of RUS. Approval of a plan pursuant to this section does not constitute an RUS endorsement of the M
V plan or an EE Program. RUS and its employees assume no legal liability for the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, product, service, or process funded directly or indirectly with financial assistance provided under RESP.
(d)
Quality control.
The RESP borrower must produce a detailed explanation, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, describing the methods and processes to verify that the installation of the EE measures for the EE program, for which those measures have been implemented were properly executed.
(1) The RESP borrower and the Qualified consumer must agree on the EE measures to be implemented based on a quantifiable and verifiable assessment of the impacts that such measures will have in reducing the Qualified consumer's energy cost or consumption.
(2) A RESP borrower may elect to engage a third-party contractor to carry out the assessments required in this Section and install the EE measures as long as there is no Conflict of interest.
(3) RESP borrower employees and third-party contractors engaged to carry out activities in the EE Program must be qualified and have adequate expertise to perform energy audits, retrofit installations, and do the quality control assessments according to the applicable industry best-practices. Individual's credentials and expertise should be accredited through one of the following options:
(i) Possessing a current Home Energy Professional Certification or a similar certification from a nationally, industry-recognized organization that is consistent with the Job Task Analyses Guidelines issued by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory or its successor.
(ii) Possessing a current certification issued by an organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy in accordance with the Better Buildings Workforce Guidelines or its successor.
(iii) Producing evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, that the individual possesses proficiency in the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to perform the tasks and critical work functions relevant to the duties assigned in the EE Program.
(4) A RESP borrower that elects to carry out the EE Program with a contractor, must validate and document the following:
(i) The contractor has adequate capacity and resources to engage with customers, conduct whole-property assessments, performance testing, diagnostic reasoning, and fulfill all data collection and reporting requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, having access to satisfactory diagnostic equipment, tools, qualified staff, data systems and software, and administrative support.
(ii) The contractor is current and in good standing with all applicable registration and licensing requirements for their specific jurisdiction and trade.
(iii) The contractor employs individuals (either its own employees or subcontractors) that are qualified to install or physically oversee the installation of home improvements in compliance with local building codes and industry-accepted protocols.
(5) A RESP borrower is responsible for actions or omissions departing from the required standards under this Section by third party partners or contractors employed in connection with an EE Program funded under this Section.
(6) The RESP loan documents are solely for the benefit of RUS and the RESP Borrower and nothing in the loan documents between RUS and the RESP borrower will confer upon any third party any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever. Neither RUS nor its employees makes any warranty, express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to any information, product, service, or process available from a RESP borrower or its agents.
§ 1719.11

§ 1720.4
General standards.
(a) In accordance with section 313A of the RE Act, a guarantee will be issued by the Secretary only if the Secretary determines, in accordance with the requirements set forth in this part, that:
(1) The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will be used by the guaranteed lender to make loans to borrowers for utility infrastructure purposes eligible for assistance under this chapter, or to refinance, subject to certain limitations, bonds or notes previously issued by the guaranteed lender for such purposes to a borrower that has at any time received, or is eligible to receive, a loan under the RE Act;
(2) At the time the guarantee is executed, the total principal amount of guaranteed bonds outstanding would not exceed the principal amount of outstanding eligible loans previously made by the guaranteed lender;
(3) The proceeds of the guaranteed bonds will not be used directly or indirectly to fund projects for the generation of electricity; and
(4) The guaranteed lender will not use any amounts obtained from the reduction in funding costs provided by a loan guarantee issued prior to June 18, 2008, to reduce the interest rates borrowers are paying on new or outstanding loans, other than new concurrent loans as provided in part 1710 of this chapter.
(b) During the term of the guarantee, the guaranteed lender shall:
(1) Limit cash patronage refunds for guaranteed lenders having a credit rating below the level proscribed by the agency in its funding notice or below investment grade or comparable level on its senior secured debt without regard to the guarantee. For such guaranteed lenders, cash patronage refunds are limited to five percent of the total patronage refund eligible. The limit on patronage refunds must be maintained until the credit rating is restored to the level proscribed by RUS in its funding notice or to investment grade or above. For those guaranteed lenders subject to patronage limitations, equity securities issued as part of the patronage refund shall not be redeemable in cash during the term of any part of the guarantee, and the guaranteed lender shall not issue any dividends on any class of equity securities during the term of the guarantee.
(2) Maintain sufficient collateral secured by a perfected lien equal to the principal amount outstanding. Collateral shall be in the form of specific and identifiable unpledged securities equal to the value of the guaranteed amount plus sufficient margin to cover potential costs, fees, and expenses which may arise in the event of a default. In the case of a guaranteed lender's default, the U.S. Government's claim shall not be subordinated to the claims of other creditors, and the indenture must provide that in the event of default, the Government has the sole right to the pledged instruments. The Secretary has discretion to require additional collateral at any time should circumstances warrant.
(c) The final maturity of the guaranteed bonds shall not exceed 30 years.
(d) The guaranteed bonds shall be issued to the Federal Financing Bank on terms and conditions consistent with comparable government-guaranteed bonds and satisfactory to the Secretary.
(e) The Secretary shall guarantee payments on guaranteed bonds in such forms and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties, and requirements (including requirements for audits) as determined appropriate for satisfying the requirements of this part. The Secretary shall require the guaranteed lender to enter into a guarantee agreement to evidence its acceptance of the foregoing. Any guarantee issued under this part shall be made in a separate and distinct offering.

§ 1720.5
Eligibility criteria.
(a) To be eligible to participate in the program, a guaranteed lender must be:
(1) A bank or other lending institution organized as a private, not-for-profit cooperative association, or otherwise organized on a non-profit basis; and
(2) Able to demonstrate to the Secretary that it possesses the appropriate expertise, experience, and qualifications to make loans for utility infrastructure purposes.
(b) To be eligible to receive a guarantee, a guaranteed lender's bond must meet the following criteria:
(1) The guaranteed lender must furnish the Secretary with a certified list of the principal balances of eligible loans then outstanding and certify that such aggregate balance is at least equal to the sum of the proposed principal amount of guaranteed bonds to be issued, and any previously issued guaranteed bonds outstanding; and
(2) The guaranteed bonds to be issued by the guaranteed lender must receive an underlying investment grade rating from a rating agency, without regard to the guarantee. If an applicant has no outstanding RUS guarantees or has outstanding aggregate guarantees of less than $25 million, the Administrator may prescribe in advance by notice an alternate method for the guaranteed lender to demonstrate creditworthiness.
(c) A lending institution's status as an eligible applicant does not assure that the Secretary will issue the guarantee sought in the amount or under the terms requested, or otherwise preclude the Secretary from declining to issue a guarantee.

(a)
Eligibility screening.
Each application will be reviewed by the Secretary to determine whether it is eligible under 7 CFR 1720.5, the information required under 7 CFR 1720.6 is complete and the proposed guaranteed bond complies with applicable statutes and regulations. The Secretary can at any time reject an application that fails to meet these requirements.
(b)
Evaluation.
Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, applications will be subject to a substantive review, on a competitive basis, by the Secretary based upon the following evaluation factors, listed in order of importance:
(1) The extent to which the proposed provisions indicate the applicant will be able to repay the guaranteed bonds;
(2) The adequacy of the proposed provisions to protect the Federal government, based upon items including, but not limited to the nature of the pledged security, the priority of the lien position, if any, pledged by the applicant, and the provision for an orderly retirement of principal such as an amortizing bond structure or an internal sinking fund;
(3) The applicant's demonstrated performance of financially sound business practices as evidenced by reports of regulators, auditors and credit rating agencies;

(7) The geographic or economic distribution of funds made available through this program or use of such funds to advance rural development infrastructure goals.
(c)
Independent assessment.
Before a guarantee decision is made by the Secretary, the Secretary shall request that the Federal Financing Bank review the adequacy of the determination by the rating agency required under § 1720.5(b)(2) as to whether the bond or note to be issued would be below investment grade without the guarantee, or such other evidence of creditworthiness as may be required by the Administrator under § 1720.5(b)(2).
(d)
Decisions by the Secretary.
The Secretary shall approve or deny applications in a timely manner as such applications are received; provided, however, that in order to facilitate competitive evaluation of applications, the Secretary may from time to time defer a decision until more than one application is pending. The Secretary may limit the number of guarantees made
to a maximum of five per year, to ensure a sufficient examination is conducted of applicant requests. RUS shall notify the applicant in writing of the Secretary's approval or denial of an application. Approvals for guarantees shall be conditioned upon compliance with 7 CFR 1720.4 and 1720.6 of this part. The Secretary reserves the discretion to approve an application for an amount less than that requested.

# Subpart A—Advance of Funds
§ 1721.1
Advances.
(a)
Purpose and amount.
With the exception of minor projects which are addressed in paragraph (b) of this section and generation projects which need to be included on a RUS Form 740c or an amendment to a RUS Form 740c, loan funds will be advanced for projects which are included in a RUS approved construction work plan (CWP), Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program work plan (EEWP), or approved amendment to either, have received written documentation of RUS concluding its environmental reviews and have complied with all Contracting and Bidding Procedures included in 7 CFR part 1726. Loan fund advances can be requested in an amount representing actual costs incurred.
(b)
Minor project.
Minor project means a project costing $250,000 or less. Such a project qualifies for advance of loan funds even though it may not have been included in an RUS-approved borrower's CWP, amendment to such
CWP, or approved loan. Total advances requested shall not exceed the total loan amount. All projects for which loan fund advances are requested must be constructed to achieve purposes permitted by terms of the loan contract between the borrower and RUS.
(c)
Certification.
Pursuant to the applicable provisions of the RUS loan contract, borrowers must certify with each request for funds to be approved for advance that such funds are for projects in compliance with this section and shall also provide for those that cost in excess of $250,000 a contract or work order number as applicable and a CWP cross-reference project coded identification number. For a minor project not included in a RUS approved borrower's CWP or CWP amendment, the Borrower shall describe the project and do one of the following to satisfy RUS' environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970:
(1) If applicable, state that the project is a categorical exclusion of a type described in § 1970.53 of this title; or
(2) If applicable, state that the project is a categorical exclusion of a type that normally requires the preparation of an environmental report (see § 1970.54 of this title) and then submit the environmental report with the request for funds to be approved for advance.
(d)
Noncompliance.
Where insured loan funds are found to have been advanced in noncompliance with this section, borrowers will be required to deposit the appropriate amount of the over-advance in the construction fund-trustee account and pay any accrued and unpaid interest to RUS. The Administrator will require borrowers, in order to remedy such noncompliance, to pay an additional amount equal to the interest on the funds over-advanced for the period such funds were outstanding, calculated at a rate equal to the difference between the RUS loan interest rate and the most recent rate at which RUS sold Certificates of Beneficial Ownership (CBO's). While RUS will generally permit the amount of over-advance deposited in the construction fund-trustee account to be subsequently used by the borrower for RUS approved projects, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude RUS from exercising any rights or remedies which RUS may have pursuant to the loan contract.
[64 FR 72489, Dec. 28, 1999, as amended at 78 FR 73370, Dec. 5, 2013; 81 FR 11026, Mar. 2, 2016; 86 FR 36197, July 9, 2021; 89 FR 17274, Mar. 11, 2024]

# Subpart B—Extensions of Payments of Principal and Interest

# Source:
67 FR 485, Jan. 4, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1721.100
Purpose.
This subpart contains RUS procedures and conditions under which Borrowers of loans made by RUS may request RUS approval for extensions for the payment of principal and interest.
§ 1721.101
General.
(a) The procedures in this subpart are intended to provide Borrowers with the flexibility to request an extension of principal and interest as authorized under section 12(a) of the RE Act and section 236 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-606).
(b) The total amount of interest that has been deferred, including interest on deferred principal, will be added to the principal balance, and the total amount of principal and interest that has been deferred will be reamortized over the remaining life of the applicable note beginning in the first year the deferral period ends.
(c) Payment of principal and interest will not be extended more than 5 years after such payment is due as originally scheduled. However, in cases where the extension is being granted because, at the sole discretion of the Administrator, a severe hardship has been experienced, the Administrator may grant a longer extension provided that the maturity date of any such loan does not extend to a date beyond forty (40) years from the date of the note.
[67 FR 485, Jan. 4, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 37953, June 26, 2003]
§ 1721.102
Definitions.
The definitions contained in 7 CFR 1710.2 are applicable to this subpart unless otherwise stated.
§ 1721.103
Policy.
(a) In reviewing requests for extension of payment of principal and interest, consideration shall be given to the effect of such extensions on the security of the Government's loans, and on the ability of the Borrower to achieve program objectives. It is the policy of RUS to extend the time for payment of principal and interest on the basis of findings that such extension does not impair the security and feasibility of the Government's loans and:
(1) Is essential to the effectiveness of the Borrower's operations in achieving RUS program objectives which include providing reliable, affordable electricity to RE Act beneficiaries;
(2) Is necessary to help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payments of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended; or
(3) Is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.
(b) Extensions will be given in the minimum amount to achieve the purpose of the extension.
(c) The maximum interest rate a RUS Borrower can charge on deferments for programs relating to consumer loans,
e.g.,
energy resource conservation (ERC) program, contribution-in-aid of construction (CIAC), etc., will not be more than 300 basis points above the average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred. For example, if the RUS Borrower's average interest rate on the note(s) being deferred is 5 percent, the RUS Borrower can charge a maximum interest rate of 8 percent.
[67 FR 485, Jan. 4, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 37953, June 26, 2003]
§ 1721.104
Eligible purposes.
(a)
Deferments for financial hardship.
(1) In cases of financial hardship, a Borrower may request that RUS defer principal or interest or both. RUS will consider whether the deferral will help a Borrower place its operations on a more stable financial basis and thereby provide assurance of repayment of loans within the time when payment of such loans are due under the terms of the note or notes as extended.
(2) RUS will determine whether a Borrower qualifies for the deferment on a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as the following:
(i) Substantial unreimbursed or uninsured expenses relating to storm damage;
(ii) Loss of large power load (as defined in § 1710.7(c)(6)(ii) of this chapter, Large retail power contracts); or
(iii) Substantial loss of consumers or load due to hostile annexations and condemnations, without adequate compensation.
(b)
Deferments for energy resource conservation (ERC) loans.
(1) A Borrower may request that RUS defer principal payments to make funds available to the Borrower's consumers to conserve energy. Amounts deferred under this program can be used to cover the cost of labor and materials for the following energy conservation measures:
(i) Caulking;
(ii) Weather-stripping;
(iii) Heat pump systems (including water source heat pumps);
(iv) Heat pumps, water heaters, and central heating or central air conditioning system replacements or modifications, which reduce energy consumption;
(v) Ceiling insulation;
(vi) Wall insulation;
(vii) Floor insulation;
(viii) Duct insulation;
(ix) Pipe insulation;
(x) Water heater insulation;

# Subpart F—RUS Contract Forms
§ 1724.70
Standard forms of contracts for borrowers.
(a)
General.
The standard loan agreement between RUS and its borrowers provides that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter, the borrower shall use standard forms of contract promulgated by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural services financed by a loan made or
guaranteed by RUS. (See section 5.16 of appendix A to subpart C of part 1718 of this chapter.) This subpart prescribes RUS procedures in promulgating electric program standard contract forms and identifies those forms that borrowers are required to use.
(b)
Contract forms.
RUS promulgates standard contract forms, identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, § 1724.74(c), that borrowers are required to use in accordance with the provisions of this part. A borrower may deviate from the Required Contract Form provided the borrower certifies to RUS that the non-standard form incorporates the provisions of the Required Contract Form that are contained in the RUS Certification Form found at
https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/directives/electric-sample-documents.
Further, a borrower may utilize a contract other than a Required Contract Form if it is allowed to do so by an indenture or any other agreement between the borrower and RUS. In addition, RUS promulgates standard contract forms identified in the List of Guidance Contract Forms contained in § 1724.74(c) that the borrowers may but are not required to use in the planning, design, and construction of their electric systems. Borrowers are not required to use these guidance contract forms in the absence of an agreement to do so.
[63 FR 58284, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended at 87 FR 73442, Nov. 30, 2022]
§ 1724.71

As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the RE Act, distribution borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the standard distribution loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called “listed contract forms”) identified in the List of Required Standard Contract Forms contained in § 1724.74(c), except as provided in § 1724.70(b). Power Supply borrowers typically execute an indenture and loan contract as well. The terms and conditions of any indenture and loan contract executed by a Power Supply borrower shall govern its obligations with respect to the use of contract forms.
(b)
Compliance.
If a borrower is required by this part or by its loan agreement with RUS to use a listed standard form of contract, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS, either paper or electronic format, except as provided in § 1724.70(bc). Exact electronic reproduction is acceptable. The approved RUS standard forms of contract shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications approved by RUS on a case-by-case basis must be clearly shown so as to indicate the modification difference from the standard form of contract.
(c)
Amendment.
Where a borrower has entered into a contract in the form required by this part, no change may be made in the terms of the contract, by amendment, waiver or otherwise, without the prior written approval of RUS except as provided in § 1724.70(b).
(d)
Waiver.
RUS may waive for good cause, on a case by case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking a waiver by RUS must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver.
(e)
Violations.
A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in this part is a violation of the terms of its loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.
[63 FR 58285, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 7108, Feb. 13, 2004; 87 FR 73442, Nov. 30, 2022]

§ 1726.10
Introduction.
The policies, procedures and requirements included in this part are intended to implement provisions of the standard form of loan documents between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and its electric borrowers. Unless prior written approval is received from RUS, borrowers are required to comply with RUS policies and procedures as a condition to RUS providing loans, loan guarantees, or reimbursement of general funds for the construction and improvement of electric facilities. Requirements relating to RUS approval of plans and specifications, duties and responsibilities of the engineer and architect, and engineering and architectural services contracts, are contained in other RUS regulations. The terms “RUS form”, “RUS standard form”, “RUS specification”, “and RUS bulletin” have the same meanings as the terms “REA form”, “REA standard form”, “REA specification”, “and REA bulletin”, respectively, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1726.11
Purpose.
Each borrower is responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of its electric system. RUS, as a secured lender, has a legitimate interest in accomplishing RUS's programmatic objectives, and in assuring that the costs of construction, materials, and equipment are reasonable and economical and that the property securing the loans is constructed adequately to serve the purposes for which it is intended.
§ 1726.12
Applicability.
The requirements of this part apply to the procurement of materials and equipment for use by electric borrowers in their electric systems and to the construction of their electric systems if such materials, equipment, and construction are financed, in whole or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by RUS, including reimbursable projects. In order for general fund expenditures for procurement or construction to be eligible for reimbursement from loan funds, the borrower must comply with the procedures required by this part. In the case of jointly owned projects, RUS will determine on a case by case basis the applicability of the requirements of this part.
§ 1726.13
Waivers.
The Administrator may waive, for good cause on a case by case basis, certain requirements and procedures of this part. RUS reserves the right, as a condition of providing loans, loan guarantees, or other assistance, to require any borrower to make any specification, contract, or contract amendment subject to the approval of the Administrator.
§ 1726.14
Definitions.
Terms used in this part have the meanings set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2. References to specific RUS forms and other RUS documents, and to specific sections or lines of such forms and documents, shall include the corresponding forms, documents, sections and lines in any subsequent revisions of these forms and documents. In addition to the terms defined in 7 CFR 1710.2, the following terms have the following meanings for the purposes of this part:

§ 1726.15
“Buy American”.
The borrower must ensure that all materials and equipment financed with loans made or guaranteed by RUS complies with the “Buy American” provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 903 note), as amended by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (107 Stat 2129). When a “Buy American” certificate is required by this part, this must be on RUS Form 213.
§ 1726.16
Debarment and suspension.
Borrowers are required to comply with certain requirements on debarment and suspension in connection with procurement activities set forth in 2 CFR part 180, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 417, particularly with respect to lower tier transactions,
e.g.,
procurement contracts for goods or services.
[79 FR 76003, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 1726.17
Restrictions on lobbying.
Borrowers are required to comply with certain restrictions and requirements in connection with procurement activities as set forth in 2 CFR part 418.
[79 FR 76003, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 1726.18
Pre-loan contracting.
Borrowers must consult with RUS prior to entering into any contract for material, equipment, or construction if a construction work plan, general funds, loan or loan guarantee for the proposed work has not been approved. While the RUS staff will work with the borrower in such circumstances, nothing contained in this part is to be construed as authorizing borrowers to enter into any contract before the availability of funds has been ascertained by the borrower and all environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, have been met.
[81 FR 11027, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 1726.19
Use of competitive procurement.
RUS borrowers' procurement is not subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1); however, since borrowers receive the benefit of Federal financial assistance borrowers must use competitive procurement to the greatest extent practical. The borrower must use competitive procurement for obtaining all goods or services when a RUS loan or loan guarantee is involved except:
(a) As specifically provided for in subparts B through F of this part; or
(b) A waiver is granted.
§ 1726.20
Standards and specifications.
All materials, equipment, and construction must meet the minimum requirements of all applicable RUS standards and specifications. (See part 1728 of this chapter, Electric Standards and Specifications for Materials and Construction, which is applicable regardless of the source of funding.)
[69 FR 7109, Feb. 13, 2004]
§ 1726.21
New materials.
The borrower shall purchase only new materials and equipment unless otherwise approved by RUS, on a case by case basis, prior to the purchase.
§ 1726.22
Methods of construction.
The borrower is generally responsible for determining whether construction will be by contract or force account. If construction is by contract, the borrower must determine whether materials will be supplied by the contractor or will be furnished by the borrower. RUS reserves the right to require contract construction in lieu of force account construction on a case by case basis.
§ 1726.23
Qualification of bidders.
(a)
Qualified bidder list (QBL).
The borrower shall (acting through its engineer, if applicable) review the qualifications of prospective bidders for contract construction and for material and equipment procurement, and select firms qualified for inclusion on the borrower's list of qualified bidders for each contract. (See also § 1726.16 and § 1726.17.) A bid may not be solicited from a prospective bidder or opened by the borrower unless that bidder has been determined to be a qualified bidder for the contract. When preparing the QBL, in addition to the actual experience of the borrower, if any, in dealing with a prospective bidder, the borrower may solicit information from that bidder or from other parties with firsthand experience regarding the firm's capabilities and experience. It is also important to consider the firm's performance record, safety record, and similar factors in determining whether to include that firm on the QBL, since the borrower may not evaluate these factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder.
(b)
Conflict of interest.
If there is a relationship between the borrower or engineer and a prospective bidder which might cause the borrower or engineer to have or appear to have a conflict of interest, that prospective bidder shall not be included on the QBL unless the engineer discloses the nature of the relationship to the borrower. In the case of the borrower, if its employees or directors have a relationship with a prospective bidder, the prospective bidder shall not be included on the qualified bidders list unless the nature of the relationship is disclosed to the board of directors, and the board of directors specifically approves the inclusion of that bidder in light of the potential for a conflict of interest.
§ 1726.24
Standard forms of contracts for borrowers.
(a)
General.
The standard loan agreement between RUS and the borrowers provides that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter, the borrower shall use standard forms of contracts promulgated by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS. This part implements these provisions of the RUS loan agreement. Subparts A through H and J of this part prescribe when and how borrowers are required to use RUS standard forms of contracts in procurement and construction. Subpart I of this part prescribes the procedures that RUS follows in promulgating standard contract forms and identifies those contract forms that borrowers are required to use for procurement and construction.
(b)
Amendments to contracts
—(1)
Contract forms.
The borrower must use RUS Form 238, Construction or Equipment Contract Amendment, for any change or addition in any contract for construction or equipment.
(2)
Special considerations.
Each time an amendment to a construction contract is executed, the borrower must ensure that contractor's bond is adequate, that all necessary licenses and permits have been obtained, and that any environmental requirements associated with the proposed construction have been met.
(3)
Amendment approval requirements.
(i) If a RUS approved form of contract is required by this part, an amendment must not alter the terms and conditions of the RUS approved form of contract without prior RUS approval.
(ii) The borrower must make a contract amendment subject to RUS approval if the underlying contract was made subject to RUS approval and the total amended contract price exceeds 120 percent of the original contract price (excluding any escalation provision contained in the contract).

Interest on overdue accounts.
Certain RUS contract forms contain a provision concerning payment of interest on overdue accounts. Prior to issuing the invitation to bidders, the borrower must insert an interest rate equal to the lowest “Prime Rate” listed in the “Money Rates” section of the Wall Street Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued. If no prime rate is published on that date, the last such rate published prior to that date must be used. The rate must not, however, exceed the maximum rate allowed by any applicable state law.

The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist:
(1)
Fewer than three bona fide bids received.
If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract
project, the borrower must determine that all reasonable measures have been taken to assure competition prior to awarding the contract. This determination must be documented and such documentation submitted to RUS where required by subpart A of this part. The borrower may, however, elect to reject all bids, make changes in the specification or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids.
(2)
Significant error or ambiguity in the specification.
If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids.
(3)
Minor errors or omissions in the specification.
If minor errors or omissions in the specification are found, the borrower must issue an addendum to each prospective bidder correcting the error or omission prior to opening any bids. After bid opening, the error or omission must be corrected in the executed contract.
(4)
Minor errors or irregularities in bid.
The borrower may waive minor errors or irregularities in any bid, if the borrower determines that such minor errors or irregularities were made through inadvertence. Any such minor errors or irregularities so waived must be corrected on the bid in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the borrower.
(5)
Non-minor error or irregularity in bid.
If a bid contains a non-minor error or irregularity, the bid must be rejected and the bid price must not be disclosed.
(6)
Unbalanced bid.
If a bid contains disproportionate prices between labor and materials or between various construction units, the borrower may reject the bid.
(7)
No acceptable price quoted.
If none of the bidders quote an acceptable price, the borrower may reject all bids.
(g)
Evaluating bids.
The borrower (acting through the engineer, if applicable) must conduct the evaluation of bids on the basis of the criteria set out in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders.” The contract, if awarded, must be awarded to the bidder with the lowest evaluated responsive bid.
(h)
Announcement of bids.
If possible, the borrower will announce bids at the bid opening. However, where extensive evaluation is required, the borrower may elect to adjourn and make formal written announcement to all bidders at a later time. Any discrepancy in a rejected bid must be indicated in the bid announcement.
(i)
Award of contract.
Upon completion of the bid evaluations and based upon the findings and recommendations of the borrower's management and engineer, the borrower's board of directors will either:
(1) Resolve to award the contract to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; or
(2) Reject all bids.
(j)
Certification by the borrower and its engineer.
The borrower shall certify and the engineer shall certify as follows: “The procedures for formal competitive bidding, as described in 7 CFR 1726.201, were followed in awarding this contract.” The certification executed by and on behalf of the borrower and its engineer shall be submitted to RUS in writing where required by subpart A of this part.

# Subpart H—Modifications to RUS Standard Contract Forms
§ 1726.250
General.
RUS provides standard forms of contract for the procurement of materials, equipment, and construction and for contract amendments and various related forms for use by RUS borrowers. See § 1726.304 for a listing of these forms and how to obtain them. The standard forms of contract shall be used by the borrowers in accordance with the provisions of this part. RUS will give prior approval to certain modifications to these forms without changing the applicable requirements for RUS approval. Such approved modifications are set forth in this subpart. These are the only modifications given prior RUS approval.
[69 FR 7109, Feb. 13, 2004]
§ 1726.251
Prior approved contract modification related to price escalation on transmission equipment, generation equipment, and generation construction contracts.
(a)
General.
Where the borrower encounters reluctance among manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on transmission equipment or generation equipment, materials or construction, modifications may be made in the RUS standard form of contracts. These modifications, if
applicable, may include, as an alternative to the standard form, provisions for adjusting a base price either upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes between the time of the bid and the time the work is performed or materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large number of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) will select the indexes for the particular item to be used in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers' corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are reported in the BLS's monthly publications entitled “Employment and Earnings” and “Producer Prices and Price Indexes.” These publications may be ordered through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or any of the BLS regional offices.
(b)
Material and equipment contracts.
The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the material or equipment contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:
(1) Insert new paragraphs in the Notice and Instructions to Bidders as follows:
“Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either basis.
Nonfirm prices.
The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and material indexes.
A proportion of ____ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent labor cost and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate____ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the labor is incorporated in the equipment or materials. The adjustment for labor costs shall be obtained by applying the percentage of increase or decrease in such index, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the percentage of the contract prices deemed to represent labor costs. A portion of ____ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, material index ____ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the labor cost adjustment.”
(2) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:
“Firm Price $________
Nonfirm Price $________”
(3) For equipment that uses a large quantity of insulating oil, the borrower may insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:
“The price for insulating oil shall be adjusted upward or downward based on the change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Refined Petroleum Rate (057) from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the oil is purchased by the equipment supplier. Contracts shall be evaluated based on an estimated cost of ____ cents per gallon [the borrower will enter the appropriate cost] for oil. Such adjustment, if any, shall not change the contract amount for purpose of applying any other adjustments to the contract prices.”
(c)
Construction contracts.
The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the construction contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:
(1) Insert new paragraphs in the “Notice and Instructions” to Bidders as follows:
“Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either basis.
Nonfirm Prices
—The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and material indexes.
A proportion of ____ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent shop labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate ____ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which bids are opened to the month in which the work is accomplished. The adjustment for shop labor costs shall be obtained
by applying the percentage increase or decrease in such index, to the percentage of each partial payment deemed to represent shop labor costs. A portion of ____ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract prices shall be deemed to represent material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Producer Price Index, ____ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the shop labor costs adjustment. A portion of ____ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent field labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate ____ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index], for the period and in a manner similar to the shop labor costs adjustment.”
(2) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:
“Firm Price $________
Nonfirm Price $________”
§ 1726.252
Prior approved contract modification related to liability for special and consequential damages.
This section applies only to transmission equipment purchases and generation contracts. Where the borrower anticipates difficulty in obtaining responsive bids on RUS standard contract forms due to a lack of limitation with respect to special and consequential damages, and where the borrower believes that such a modification will encourage competition through the receipt of an alternative bid which limits the bidder's liability for special and consequential damages, the borrower may make the following approved phrase modifications in the RUS standard contract form on which the borrower solicits bids:
(a) Insert new paragraphs in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders” as follows:
“Proposals are invited on the basis of alternative Liability Clause Numbers 1 and 2. The Owner will determine on which Liability Clause basis the award will be made. Any other liability clauses in the proposal or any other modifications will be considered not responsive and unacceptable. These Liability Clauses are defined as follows:
Liability Clause Number 1.
This will include unmodified all of the standard terms and conditions of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto.
Liability Clause Number 2.
This will include the following paragraph, in addition to all of the standard terms and conditions, otherwise unmodified, of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto:
“Except for the Bidder's willful delay or refusal to perform the contract in accordance with its terms, the Bidder's liability to the Owner for special or consequential damages on account of breach of this contract shall not exceed in total an amount equal to ____ percent [the borrower will insert an appropriate percentage between 0 and 100 percent, inclusive] of the contract price.”
(b) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:
“Price $ (Based on Liability Clause 1)________
Price $ (Based on Liability Clause 2)________”
(c) Insert the following in the acceptance section of the standard contract form:
“This contract is based on Liability Clause Number________.”
[60 FR 10155, Feb. 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 7109, Feb. 13, 2004]
§ 1726.253
Prior approved contract modification related to alternative bid provision for payment to contractor for bulk purchase of materials.
When construction is to be performed over an extended period of time, but large quantities of material are to be purchased by the contractor at the beginning of the project (e.g., cable for URD installations), the borrower may allow alternative bids providing for payment to the contractor of 90 percent of the cost of such materials within 30 days of delivery of those materials at the job site.

Prior approved contract modifications related to indemnification.
(a) As an alternative to the indemnification provision required in RUS standard construction contract forms in those jurisdictions requiring specific language concerning the requirement that the indemnitor indemnify the indemnitee for the indemnitee's own negligence, the borrower may add the words “otherwise this provision shall apply to any alleged negligence or condition caused by the Owner” so that the first paragraph reads as follows:
“i. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Bidder's employees) and loss, damage to or destruction of Owner's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but not limited to Bidder's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment supplied or services performed by Bidder, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall be construed as making Bidder liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence of Owner, otherwise this provision shall apply to any negligence or condition caused by the Owner.”
(b) As an alternative to the indemnification provision required in RUS standard construction contract forms in those jurisdictions that have a legal prohibition against one party indemnifying another for the other's negligence, the borrower may replace the words “defend, indemnify, and hold harmless” with the words “ shall pay on behalf of” so that the first paragraph reads as follows:
“i. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall pay on behalf of Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Bidder's employees) and loss, damage to or destruction of Owner's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but not limited to Bidder's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment supplied or services performed by Bidder, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall be construed as making Bidder liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence of Owner, otherwise this provision shall apply to any negligence or condition caused by the Owner.”
(c) If the alternative indemnification provision in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is chosen by the borrower, the language of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section would be inserted in lieu of paragraph (i) of the section indicated in the RUS standard construction contract forms as follows:

# Subpart I—RUS Standard Forms
§ 1726.300
Standard forms of contracts for borrowers.
(a)
General.
The standard loan agreement between RUS and its borrowers provides that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter, the borrower shall use standard forms of contract promulgated by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS. (See section 5.16 of appendix A to subpart C of part 1718 of this chapter.) This subpart prescribes RUS procedures in promulgating standard contract forms and identifies those
forms that borrowers are required to use.
(b)
Contract forms.
RUS promulgates standard contract forms, identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, § 1726.304(c), that borrowers are required to use in accordance with the provisions of this part. In addition, RUS promulgates standard contract forms contained in § 1726.304(d) that the borrowers may but are not required to use in the construction of their electric systems. Borrowers are not required to use these guidance contract forms in the absence of an agreement to do so.
[63 FR 58286, Oct. 30, 1998]
§ 1726.301
Borrower contractual obligations.
(a)
Loan agreement.
As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act, borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called “listed contract forms”) identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, § 1724.304(c).
(b)
Compliance.
If a borrower is required by this part or by its loan agreement with RUS to use a listed standard form of contract, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS, either paper or electronic format. Exact electronic reproduction is acceptable. The approved RUS standard forms of contract shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications approved by RUS on a case-by-case basis must be clearly shown so as to indicate the modification difference from the standard form of contract.
(c)
Amendment.
Where a borrower has entered into a contract in the form required by this part, no change may be made in the terms of the contract, by amendment, waiver or otherwise, without the prior written approval of RUS.
(d)
Waiver.
RUS may waive for good cause, on a case by case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking a waiver by RUS must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver. Waiver requests should be made prior to issuing the bid package to bidders.
(e)
Violations.
A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in this part is a violation of the terms of its loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.
[63 FR 58286, Oct. 30, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 7110, Feb. 13, 2004]

§ 1726.303
Promulgation of new or revised contract forms.
RUS may, from time to time, undertake to promulgate new contract forms or revise or eliminate existing contract forms. In so doing, RUS shall publish notice of rulemaking in the
Federal Register
announcing, as appropriate, a
revision in, or a proposal to amend § 1726.304, List of Electric Program Standard Contract Forms. The amendment may change the existing identification of a listed contract form; for example, changing the issuance date of a listed contract form or by identifying a new required contract form. The notice of rulemaking will describe the new standard contract form or the substantive change in the listed contract form, as the case may be, and the issues involved. The standard contract form or relevant portions thereof may be appended to the supplementary information section of the notice of rulemaking. As appropriate, the document shall provide an opportunity for interested persons to provide comments. A copy of each such

§ 1728.10
General purpose and scope.
(a) The requirements of this part are based on contractual provisions between RUS and the organizations which receive financial assistance from RUS.
(b) RUS will establish certain specifications and standards for materials, equipment, and construction units that will be acceptable for RUS financial assistance for the electric program. Materials and equipment purchased by the electric borrowers or accepted as contractor-furnished material must conform to RUS standards and specifications where they have been established and, if included in RUS Bulletin 43-5, “List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Systems of RUS Electrification Borrowers” (List of Materials), must be selected from that list or must have received technical acceptance from RUS. RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees, will evaluate certain materials, equipment and construction units, and will determine acceptance.

§ 1728.20
Establishment of standards and specifications.
(a)
National and other standards.
RUS will utilize standards of national standardizing groups, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Wood Preservers' Association (AWPA), the various national engineering societies and the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), to the greatest extent practical. When there are no national standards or when RUS determines that the existing national standards are not adequate for rural electric systems, RUS will prepare standards for material and equipment to be used on systems of electric borrowers. RUS standards and specifications will be codified or listed in § 1728.97, Incorporation by Reference of Electric Standards and Specifications. RUS will also prepare specifications for materials and equipment when it determines that such specifications will result in reduced costs, improved materials and equipment, or in the more effective use of engineering services.
(b)
Deviations from Standards.
No member of the RUS staff will be permitted to authorize deviations from the standard specifications, or to establish or change the technical standards, or to authorize the use of items that have not received acceptance by
the Technical Standards Committees, except as provided for under § 1728.70, or by authorization and/or delegation of authority by the Administrator of RUS.
(c)
Category of Items.
Items appearing in the List of Materials are listed by categories of generic items which are used in RUS construction standards incorporated by reference in § 1728.97. RUS will establish and define these categories and will establish all criteria for acceptability within these categories.
[50 FR 47710, Nov. 20, 1985. Redesignated at 55 FR 39395, Sept. 27, 1990, as amended at 55 FR 53487, Dec. 31, 1990]
§ 1728.30
Inclusion of an item for listing or technical acceptance.
(a)
Scope.
RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees “A” and “B” will determine the acceptability of certain standards, standard specifications, standard drawings, and items of materials and equipment to be used in transmission, distribution and general plant (excluding office equipment, tools, and work equipment, and consumer-owned electric wiring facilities).
(b)

The address of Technical Standards Committee “A” is: Chairman, Technical Standards Committee “A” (Electric), Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1500. The address of Technical Standards Committee “B” is: Chairman, Technical Standards Committee “B” (Electric), Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1500.
(c)
Review by Technical Standards Committee “A”.
All proposals for listing a product in the List of Materials must be addressed to Technical Standards Committee “A.” This committee will consider all proposals made by sponsors of specifications, drawings, materials, or equipment in categories for which RUS has established criteria for acceptability. A sponsor may be a manufacturer, supplier, contractor or any other person or organization which has made an application for listing or has requested an action by the committee. Committee “A” will consider all relevant information presented in determining whether an item should be accepted by Technical Standards Committee “A.” Formal rules of evidence and procedure shall not apply to proceedings before this committee.
(d)
Action by Technical Standards Committee “A”.
(1) Committee “A” may take one of the following actions:
(i) Accept an item for listing without conditions (domestic items only),
(ii) Reject an item (domestic or nondomestic),

Nondomestic items are items which do not qualify as domestic products pursuant to RUS “Buy American” requirement.
(iii) Accept an item for listing with conditions (domestic items only),
(iv) Table an item for a time period sufficient to allow the sponsor to be notified and furnish additional information (domestic or nondomestic),
(v) Grant technical acceptance with or without conditions for a period of one year from the date of notification by RUS (nondomestic items only).
(2) All committee decisions regarding the actions listed above must be unanimous. If the vote is not unanimous, the item shall be referred to Technical Standards Committee “B.” Written notice of Technical Standards Committee “A's” decision, stating the basis for the decision, will be provided to the sponsor.
(3) Items accepted without conditions by the Technical Standards Committees will be considered to be accepted on a general basis. No restrictions as to quantity or application will be placed on items which have received general acceptance. Items accepted subject to certain conditions, such as limited use to gain service experience, or limited use appropriate to certain areas and conditions, will be considered to be accepted on a conditional basis. The conditions will be cited as a part of the listing provided for in § 1728.60, or as part of the technical acceptance for nondomestic items.

(a)
Scope.
(1) The specification in this section describes the minimum acceptable quality of wood transmission and distribution crossarms (hereinafter called arms) purchased by or for RUS borrowers. Where there is conflict between the specification in this section and any other specification referred to in this section, the specification in this section shall govern.
(2) The requirements of the specification in this section implement contractual provisions between RUS and borrowers receiving financial assistance
from RUS. The contractual agreement between RUS and a RUS borrower requires the borrower to construct its system in accordance with RUS accepted plans and specifications. Each RUS electric and telecommunications borrower shall purchase only arms produced in accordance with the specification in this section. Each RUS electric and telecommunications borrower shall require a written confirmation from their selected contractor that all material utilized shall be produced in accordance with the specifications in this section.
(b)
General stipulations.
(1) Conformance of arms to RUS specifications is the responsibility of the producer. A member of the producer's staff shall be designated as quality control supervisor and charged with the responsibility for the exercise of proper quality control procedures throughout the production process. The primary responsibility of third-party inspection agencies is to verify that producers involved in the manufacture of RUS treated wood products have functional in-house quality control systems in place that result in the shipment of materials meeting applicable RUS specification requirements to borrowers.
(2) Treated wood products intended for RUS borrowers shall not be inspected when in the opinion of the inspector, unsafe conditions are present.
(3) Various requirements relating to quality control and inspection that are contained in § 1728.202 and ANSI O5.2 and ANSI O5.3 (both incorporated by reference in § 1728.97) shall be followed exactly and shall not be interpreted or subject to judgment by the producer's quality control personnel or by the third party inspector.
(4) The requirements of AWPA M3 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97) pertaining to record keeping, pre-treatment storage, analytical laboratories, plant gauges and other plant facilities, shall be followed.
(5) The producer shall maintain its own properly staffed and equipped analytical laboratory or contract with an independent testing laboratory at or near the treating plant to provide the required analytical service. On a case-by-case basis, with written permission from RUS, a producer with more than one treatment facility may be allowed to use a central laboratory.
(6) Arms can be purchased under either of two purchase plans; a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan or an Independent Inspection Plan. The method of inspection described in this section shall be used no matter which plan timber products are purchased under.
(7) All third-party inspectors involved in the inspection of RUS products shall maintain their impartiality when providing their inspection service. This requires that these individuals and their employers, as well as producers and suppliers involved in providing RUS borrowers with treated wood products, maintain a professional separation during the performance of their respective functions to eliminate any possible conflict of interest.
(8) With the exception of financial agreements for inspection services, inspection agencies shall neither accept nor provide gratuities or free services to suppliers.
(9) Inspection agencies shall not offer product warranties on inspected material.
(10) Arms shall be warranted to conform to this specification. Arms shall meet or exceed their minimum allowable dimensions for at least one year from time of delivery to the borrower. If any arm is determined to be defective or does not conform to this specification within 1 year from the date of delivery to the borrower, it shall be replaced as promptly as possible by the supplier. In the event of failure to do so, the purchaser may make such replacement and the cost of the arm, at destination, shall be recovered from the supplier.
(11) Arm producers shall have and maintain liability insurance in the amount of $1 million. Evidence of compliance to this requirement shall be forwarded to the RUS annually. The evidence shall be in the form of a certificate of insurance or a bond signed by a representative of the insurance company or Surety Bonding company and include a provision that no change in, or cancellation of, will be made without the prior written notice to the

(b)
General stipulations.
(1) Conformance of poles and crossarms to RUS specifications is the responsibility of the producer. A member of the producer's staff shall be designated as quality control supervisor and charged with the responsibility for the exercise of proper quality control procedures throughout the production process. The primary responsibility of third party inspection agencies is to verify that producers involved in the manufacture of RUS treated wood products have functional in-house quality control systems in place that result in the shipment of materials meeting applicable RUS specification requirements to borrowers.
(2) The requirements of AWPA M3 (incorporated by reference at § 1728.97), pertaining to recordkeeping, pretreatment storage, analytical laboratories, plant gauges, and other plant facilities, shall be followed.
(3) Treated wood products intended for RUS borrowers shall not be inspected when in the opinion of the inspector, unsafe conditions are present.
(4) Poles and crossarms can be purchased under either of two purchase plans; a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan or an Independent Inspection Plan. The method of inspection described in this section shall be used no matter which plan timber products are purchased under.
(5) Under the Independent Inspection Plan, the borrower should designate in the purchase order which inspection agency it has selected. Unless the borrower contracts for inspection as a separate transaction, the treating company shall obtain the services of the borrower's designated inspection agency. For reserve treated stock held in inventory by the producer, the producer shall obtain the services of the appropriate inspection program.
(6) All third-party inspectors involved in the inspection of RUS products shall maintain their impartiality when providing their inspection service. This requires that these individuals and their employers, as well as producers and suppliers involved in providing RUS borrowers with treated wood products, maintain the greatest degree of professional separation during the performance of their respective functions to eliminate any possible conflict of interest.
(7) With the exception of financial agreements for inspection services, inspection agencies shall not accept nor provide gratuities or free services to suppliers.
(8) Inspection agencies shall not offer product warranties on inspected material.
(9) Inspection agencies shall have and maintain liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 and a surety bond or miscellaneous Errors and Omission insurance for consequential damages for not less than $250,000. Evidence of compliance to the requirement in this paragraph (b)(9) shall be forwarded to the RUS annually. The evidence shall be in the form of a certificate of insurance or a Bond signed by a representative of the insurance or Surety Bonding company and include a provision that no change in, or cancellation of, will be made without the prior written notice to Chairman, Technical Standards Committee “A” (Electric).
(10)(i) Inspection agencies shall maintain their own properly equipped laboratory that, at a minimum, is able to run the referee methods listed in table 1 to this paragraph (b)(10) for retention
analysis for all preservatives being inspected. This laboratory shall be independent from any treating plant laboratory. Inspection Agencies may use one central laboratory. All XRF units maintained by third party inspection agencies as part of their RUS required laboratories shall be calibrated at least quarterly by said agency utilizing the referee method for each preservative treatment being analyzed or via comparison with a set of graduated treated wood standards. Each agency shall keep an up-to-date written record of these quarterly calibration results.

(11) If used for analysis, plant XRF units shall be accurate and generate reproducible results per AWPA A9. At least once monthly, their accuracy and precision shall be checked by the third-party inspector. This verification shall consist of the inspector taking a retention sample previously analyzed by the plant quality control supervisor on-site and rerunning it in the inspection agency's own laboratory using said agency's XRF unit or the referee method for a specific preservative. If the inspection agency's analytical result is within +5% of the plant's retention result on that sample, the plant XRF unit needs no further calibration.
(12) Individual inspectors in the employ of inspection agencies shall be properly trained and experienced. See § 1728.203, for details of an inspector's minimum qualifications. Upon request, inspection agencies must provide RUS with detailed written documentation verifying that each of their employees inspecting RUS materials has the minimum experience and training described in § 1728.203. Failure of an individual inspector to follow proper procedures or failure of an inspection agency to properly train and supervise their inspectors or follow applicable RUS specifications constitutes grounds for RUS debarment of said inspector and said inspection agency from future inspection of RUS financed material.
(c)
Quality control and inspection procedures.
It is the responsibility of the plant quality control supervisor to perform the following procedures to ensure that a particular lot of material conforms to the requirements of the applicable Agency specification prior to treatment. After the plant quality control supervisor has performed these procedures, a particular lot of material shall be released to the inspector for verification of conformance.
(1) For poles, inspection prior to treatment shall include:
(i) Ample space and assistance shall be provided by the treating plant for handling and turning poles. Regardless of the purchase plan poles are being purchased under, all poles in a lot shall be inspected by the plant quality control supervisor prior to offering the lot for verification by a third party.
(ii) When limited by the purchaser in a written purchase order, moisture content shall be measured with a calibrated electronic moisture meter. Calibration of the moisture meter shall include not only the zero settings for the X and Y readings, but also two resistance standards for 12 and 22 percent moisture content. Material failing to conform for moisture content may be retested upon request after recalibration of the moisture meter.
(iii) Dimensions, length, and circumference shall be measured by a standard steel tape to determine that they meet specification requirements and that they agree with the details for class and length found in the face brand/tag and butt of each pole. If it is obvious by visual comparison with a measured pole that the brand information regarding class and length is correct, individual poles need not be measured. Pole circumference dimensions measured prior to treatment shall govern acceptance. Reduction in dimension due to treatment and shipping shall be no more than 2 percent below the minimum for the pole class.
(iv) Poles in a lot shall be of the same seasoning condition and all shall be inspected for decay. If the plant quality control supervisor suspects that decay is present in a pole, a slice from both ends shall be cut for closer examination. If 3 percent or more of the poles in the lot inspected by the plant quality control supervisor show evidence of decay, the entire lot shall be unconditionally withdrawn without further sorting.
(v) Under the Independent Inspection Plan, all poles shall be examined by the third-party Inspector for verification of conformance. Under a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan, the number of poles inspected for verification of conformance may vary according to the terms of the approved plan.
(vi) Whenever it becomes evident during third party inspection of any lot of poles offered by the producer that non-conforming pieces exceed 3 percent for any one defect or 5 percent for all defects, the inspector shall withhold further inspection and reject the balance of the lot. After the producer has acted to eliminate all defective pieces, the rejected balance may be inspected as a new lot. Sorting, however, shall not be permitted when a lot has been rejected for decay.
(vii) Re-examination for mechanical damage or deterioration and for original acceptance shall be conducted on timber products not treated within 10 days after the original third-party inspection.
(2) For crossarms, inspection prior to treatment shall include:
(i) Regardless of the purchase plan arms are being purchased under, all arms in a lot shall be inspected by the plant quality control supervisor prior to offering the lot for verification by a third party.
After
the plant quality control supervisor has performed the procedures in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (vii) of this section, a particular lot of arms shall be released to the inspector for verification of conformance.
(ii) Moisture content of the arms in the lot shall be checked with a calibrated moisture meter.
(iii) Surface inspection of both ends and the side surfaces of each arms. Particular attention shall be paid to visible defects such as compression wood, red heart, honeycomb and other forms of decay, shakes, splits, through checks, low density, wane, undersize, and pitch pockets.
(iv) Inspection of bolt and insulator pin holes for proper location, dimension and excessive splintering.
(v) Inspection of brands for proper location, required content and legibility.
(vi) Under the Independent Inspection, both ends of all crossarms and a random representative sample of the lengthwise side faces of all crossarms shall be inspected. The sample size shall equal 20 percent of the lot size or 200 arms, whichever is smaller. Under a RUS approved Quality Assurance Plan, the number of crossarms inspected for verification of conformance may vary according to the terms of the approved plan.
(vii) Whenever it becomes evident during third party inspection of any lot of arms offered by the producer that non-conforming pieces exceed 2 percent of the sample size, the entire lot shall be rejected. After the producer has acted to eliminate all defective pieces,
the rejected balance may be inspected as a new lot.
(d)
Preservatives.
Creosote, waterborne preservatives, pentachlorophenol, DCOI, and copper naphthenate shall conform to current AWPA U1 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97).
(e)
Results of treatment—Poles.
(1) Following treatment, poles shall be sampled for preservative retention and penetration utilizing a calibrated increment borer 0.2 inches +0.02 inches in diameter in accordance with procedures listed in AWPA M2 (incorporated by reference in § 1728.97).
(2) Inspectors may take their own retention samples and analyze them concurrently with those taken by the quality control supervisor, but each shall work independently. The results of the plant's analysis shall be presented before verification and acceptance of the charge by the third-party inspector.
(3) Unless otherwise specified, borings shall be taken from the section of the pole extending from 1 foot below the face brand/tag to 1 foot above the face brand/tag. For pressure treated Western Red Cedar, Alaska Yellow Cedar and all butt treated poles, borings shall be taken from the section of the pole approximately 1 foot below groundline.
(4) For all species, core samples shall be taken from 20 poles in charges of 20 or more poles. If a charge consists of less than 20 poles, each pole shall be bored and then individual poles shall be bored a second time to obtain a minimum of 20 core samples. Any additional borings required to obtain the required 20 core samples shall be taken in a manner that represents the lot of material with respect to variations in size, seasoning condition, or other features that may affect the results of treatment.
(5) Retention and penetration samples shall consist of borings representative of pole volumes for each class and length in the charge, as illustrated in the following table:

# Subpart B—Operations and Maintenance Requirements
§ 1730.20
General.
Each electric program distribution, transmission and generation borrower (as defined in § 1710.2) shall operate and maintain its system in compliance with prudent utility practice, in compliance with its loan documents, and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and orders, shall maintain its systems in good repair, working order and condition, and shall make all needed repairs, renewals, replacements, alterations, additions, betterments and improvements, in accordance with applicable provisions of the borrower's security instrument. Each borrower is responsible for on-going operations and maintenance programs, individually or regionally performing a system security Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (VRA), establishing and maintaining an Emergency Restoration Plan (ERP), maintaining records of the physical, cyber and electrical condition and security of its electric system and for the quality of services provided to its customers. The borrower is also responsible for all necessary inspections and tests of the component parts of its system, and for maintaining records of such inspections and tests. Each borrower shall budget sufficient resources to operate and maintain its system and annually exercise its ERP in accordance with the requirements of this part. An actual manmade or natural event on the borrowers system in which a borrower utilizes a significant portion of its ERP shall count as an annual exercise for that calendar year, provided that after conclusion of the event, the borrower verifies accuracy of the emergency points-of-contact (POC) and the associated contact numbers as listed in their ERP. For portions of the borrower's system that are not operated by the borrower, if any, the borrower is responsible for ensuring that the operator is operating and maintaining the system properly in accordance with the operating agreement.
[69 FR 60540, Oct. 12, 2004]
§ 1730.21
Inspections and tests.
(a) Each borrower shall conduct all necessary inspections and tests of the component parts of its electric system, annually exercise its ERP, and maintain records of such inspections and tests. For the purpose of this part, “Exercise” means a borrower's Tabletop execution of, or actual implementation of, the ERP to verify the operability of the ERP. Such Exercise may be performed singly by an individual borrower, or as an active participant in a multi-party (to include utilities, government agencies and other participants or combination thereof) Tabletop execution or actual full implementation of the ERP. For the purpose of this part, “Tabletop” means a hypothetical emergency response scenario in which participants will identify the policy, communication, resources, data, coordination, and organizational elements associated with an emergency response.
(b) The frequency of inspection and testing will be determined by the borrower in conformance with applicable laws, regulations, national standards, and Prudent Utility Practice. The frequency of inspection and testing will
be determined giving due consideration to the type of facilities or equipment, manufacturer's recommendations, age, operating environment and hazards to which the facilities are exposed, consequences of failure, and results of previous inspections and tests. The records of such inspections and tests will be retained in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and Prudent Utility Practice. The retention period should be of a sufficient time period to identify long-term trends. Records must be retained at least until the applicable inspections or tests are repeated.
(c) Inspections of facilities must include a determination of whether the facility complies with the National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical Code (as applicable), and applicable State or local regulations and whether additional security measures are considered necessary to reduce the vulnerability of those facilities which, if damaged or destroyed, would severely impact the reliability and security of the electric power grid, cause significant risk to the safety and health of the public and/or impact the ability to provide service to consumers over an extended period of time. The electric power grid, also known as the transmission grid, consists of a network of electrical lines and related facilities, including certain substations, used to connect distribution facilities to generation facilities, and includes bulk transmission and subtransmission facilities as defined in § 1710.2 of this title. Any serious or life-threatening deficiencies shall be promptly repaired, disconnected, or isolated in accordance with applicable codes or regulations. Any other deficiencies found as a result of such inspections and tests are to be recorded and those records are to be maintained until such deficiencies are corrected or for the retention period required by paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is longer.
[63 FR 3450, Jan. 23, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 60540, Oct. 12, 2004]
§ 1730.22
Borrower analysis.
(a) Each borrower shall periodically analyze and document its security, operations and maintenance policies, practices, and procedures to determine if they are appropriate and if they are being followed. The records of inspections and tests are also to be reviewed and analyzed to identify any trends which could indicate deterioration in the physical or cyber condition or the operational effectiveness of the system or suggest a need for changes in security, operations or maintenance policies, practices and procedures. For portions of the borrower's system that are not operated by the borrower, if any, the borrower's written analysis would also include a review of the operator's performance under the operating agreement.
(b) When a borrower's security, operations and maintenance policies, practices, and procedures are to be reviewed and evaluated by RUS, the borrower shall:
(1) Conduct the analysis required by paragraph (a) of this section not more than 90 days prior to the scheduled RUS review;
(2) Complete RUS Form 300, Review Rating Summary, and other related forms, prior to RUS' review and evaluation; and
(3) Make available to RUS the borrower's completed RUS Form 300 (including a written explanation of the basis for each rating) and records related to the operations and maintenance of the borrower's system.
(c) For those facilities not included on the RUS Form 300 (e.g., generating plants), the borrower shall prepare and complete an appropriate supplemental form for such facilities.

§ 1730.23
Review rating summary, RUS Form 300.
The RUS Form 300 is available from RUS and shall be used when required by this part.
[86 FR 36198, July 9, 2021]
§ 1730.24
RUS review and evaluation.
RUS will initiate and conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the operations and maintenance practices of each borrower for the purpose of assessing loan security and determining borrower compliance with RUS policy as outlined in this part. This review
will normally be done at least once every four years for all Borrowers. The borrower will make available to RUS the borrower's policies, procedures, and records related to the operations and maintenance of its complete system. Reports made by other inspectors (
e.g.,
other Federal agencies, State inspectors, etc.) will also be made available, as applicable. RUS will not duplicate these other reviews but will use their reports to supplement its own review. RUS may inspect facilities, as well as records, and may also observe construction and maintenance work in the field. Key borrower personnel responsible for the facilities being inspected are to accompany RUS during such inspections, unless otherwise determined by RUS. RUS personnel may prepare an independent summary of the operations and maintenance practices of the borrower. The borrower's management will discuss this review and evaluation with its Board of Directors.
[89 FR 17276, Mar. 11, 2024]
§ 1730.25
Corrective action.
(a) For any items on the RUS Form 300 rated unsatisfactory (i.e., 0 or 1) by the borrower or by RUS, the borrower shall prepare a corrective action plan (CAP) outlining the steps (both short term and long term) the borrower will take to improve existing conditions and to maintain an acceptable rating. The CAP must include a time schedule and cost estimate for corrective actions, and must be approved by the borrower's Board of Directors. The CAP must be submitted to RUS for approval within 90 days after the completion of RUS' evaluation noted in § 1730.24.
(b) The borrower must periodically report to RUS in writing progress under the CAP. This report must be submitted to RUS every six months until all unsatisfactory items are corrected unless RUS prescribes a different reporting schedule.

# Subpart A—Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant Program—General
§ 1734.1
Purpose.
The purpose of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Loan and Grant Program is to encourage and improve telemedicine services and distance learning services in rural areas through the use of telecommunications, computer networks, and related advanced technologies by students, teachers, medical professionals, and rural residents. This subpart describes the general policies for administering the DLT program. Subpart B of this part contains the policies and procedures related to grants; subpart C contains the policies and procedures related to a combination loan and grant; and subpart D contains the policies and procedures related to loans.
§ 1734.2
Policy.
(a) The transmission of information is vital to the economic development, education, and health of rural Americans. To further this objective, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) will provide financial assistance to distance learning and telemedicine projects that will improve the access for people residing in rural areas to educational, learning, training, and health care services.
(b) In providing financial assistance, RUS will give priority to rural areas that it believes have the greatest need for distance learning and telemedicine services. RUS believes that generally the need is greatest in areas that are economically challenged, costly to serve, and experiencing outward migration. This program is consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that designate telecommunications service discounts for schools, libraries, and rural health care centers. RUS will take into consideration the community's involvement in the proposed project and the applicant's ability to leverage grant funds.
(c) In administering this subpart, RUS will not favor or mandate the use of one particular technology over another.
(d) Rural institutions are encouraged to cooperate with each other, with applicants, and with end-users to promote the program being implemented under this subpart.
(e) RUS staff will make diligent efforts to inform potential applicants in rural areas of the programs being implemented under this subpart.
(f) The Administrator may provide loans under this subpart to an entity that has received a telecommunications or electric loan under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. A borrower receiving a loan shall:
(1) Make the funds provided available to entities that qualify as distance learning or telemedicine projects satisfying the requirements of this subpart, under any terms it so chooses as long as the terms are no more stringent than the terms under which it received the financial assistance.
(2) Use the loan to acquire, install, improve, or extend a distance learning or telemedicine system referred to in this subpart.
(g) The Administrator will allocate funds that are appropriated each fiscal year for subparts B, C, and D, of this part respectively. Not more than 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, the Administrator may transfer any funds not committed to grants in the combination loan and grant program to the grant program.
(h) Financial assistance may be provided for end user sites. Financial assistance may also be provided for hubs located in rural or non-rural areas if they are necessary to provide distance learning or telemedicine services to rural residents at end user sites.
(i) The Administrator will publish, at the end of each fiscal year, a notice on the RUS Telecommunications Program Web site of all applications receiving financial assistance under this subpart. Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), applications will be available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250.

of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, operation, or sustainability of the project;
(3) Other applications would provide more benefit to rural America based on a review of the financial and technical information submitted in accordance with § 1734.25(e).
(4) Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirement of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT Program contained in § 1734.2.
(d) RUS may reduce the amount of the applicant's grant based on insufficient program funding for the fiscal year in which the project is reviewed. RUS will discuss its findings informally with the applicant and make every effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the applicant. Any discussions with the applicant and agreements made with regard to a reduced grant amount will be confirmed in writing.
§ 1734.28

(a) Loans will be approved based on availability of funds, the financial feasibility of the project in accordance with § 1734.44(d), the services to be provided which demonstrate that the project meets the general requirements of this subpart, the design of the project; costs; location; and other characteristics of the application.
(b) RUS will determine, from the information submitted with each application for a loan, whether the application achieves sufficient priority, based on the criteria set forth in the 1996 Act, to receive a loan from funds available for the fiscal year. If such priority is achieved, RUS will process the loan application on a first-in, first-out basis, provided that the total amount of applications on-hand for loans does not exceed 90 percent of the total loan funding available for the fiscal year. At such time as the total amount of applications eligible for loans, if such applications were approved, exceeds 90 percent of amount of loan funding available, RUS will process the remaining applications using the evaluation criteria referenced in § 1734.26.
(c) A loan will not be approved if it is determined that:
(1) The applicant's proposal does not indicate financial feasibility, or is not adequately secured in accordance with the requirements of § 1734.44(d);
(2) The applicant's proposal indicates technical flaws, which, in the opinion of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, or operation of the project; or
(3) Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirements of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT program contained in § 1734.2.
(d) RUS will provide the applicant with a statement of any determinations made with regard to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The applicant will be provided 15 days from the date of the RUS letter to respond, provide clarification, or make any adjustments or corrections to the project. If, in the opinion of the Administrator, the applicant fails to adequately respond to any determinations or other findings made by the Administrator, the loan will not be approved, and the applicant will be notified of this determination. If the applicant does not agree with this finding an appeal may be filed in accordance with § 1734.47.
§ 1734.46
Submission of applications.
(a) RUS will accept applications for loans submitted by RUS Telecommunications GFRs, by Rural Development State Directors, or by applicants themselves. Applications for loans under this subpart may be filed at any time and will be evaluated as received on a non-competitive basis.

To be considered for a loan, the applicant must submit any additional information requested to complete the application within 15 working days of the date of the State Director's written response. If the applicant fails to submit such information, the application will be returned to the applicant.
(2) Within 30 days of the determination of a completed application in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, review the application to determine suitability for financial assistance in accordance with § 1734.45, and other requirements of this subpart. Based on its review, the State Director will work with the applicant to resolve any questions or obtain any additional information. The applicant will be notified, in writing, of any additional information required to allow a financial assistance recommendation and will be provided a reasonable period of time to furnish the additional information.
(3) Based on the review in accordance with § 1734.45 and other requirements of this subpart, make a preliminary determination of suitability for financial assistance. A loan recommendation will be prepared by the State Director with concurrence of the RUS telecommunications GFR that addresses the provisions of §§ 1734.44 and 1734.45 and other applicable requirements of this subpart.
(4) If the application is determined suitable for further consideration by RUS, forward an original and an electronic version of the application with a loan recommendation, signed jointly, to the Assistant Administrator, Telecommunications Program, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC. The applicant will be notified by letter of this action. Upon receipt of the application from the State Director, RUS will conduct a cursory review of the application and the recommendation. A final determination will be made within 15 days. If the Administrator determines that a loan can be approved, the State Director will be notified and the State Director will notify the applicant. Applications for loans will be processed, and approved loans serviced, in accordance with §§ 1734.5 through 1734.12.

Subparts F through J of this part implement those provisions by setting forth the policies, procedures, and requirements for telephone borrowers planning to acquire existing telephone lines, facilities, or systems with RUS loan or other funds, or planning to merge or consolidate with another system. This part supersedes all RUS Bulletins that are in conflict with it.
(c) Subparts F through J of this part also detail RUS's requirements with respect to mergers and acquisitions involving RUS loan funds.
(d) Entities applying for a loan under this part may be eligible to receive a grant under 7 CFR 1738.101, for a portion of the project providing retail broadband service.

§ 1735.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Access line

Acquisition
means the purchase of another telephone system, lines, or facilities whether by acquiring telephone plant in service or majority stock interest of one or more organizations.

the weighted (by dollar amount of each class of facility in the loan) average economic life of all classes of facilities in the loan.
Consolidation
means the combination of two or more borrower or nonborrower organizations, pursuant to state law, into a new successor organization that takes over the assets and assumes the liabilities of those organizations.

Economic life
as applied to facilities financed by loan funds, means the number of years resulting from dividing 100 percent by the depreciation rate (expressed as a percent) approved by the regulatory body with jurisdiction over the telephone service provided by the borrower for the class of facility involved or, if no approved rate exists, by the median depreciation rate expressed as a percent as published by RUS in its Statistical Report, Rural Telephone Borrowers for all RUS borrowers for that class of facility.
Exchange access
means the offering of access to telephone exchange services or facilities for the purpose of the origination or termination of telephone toll services.
