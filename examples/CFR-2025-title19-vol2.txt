# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart A—Liability for Duties and Requirement To Enter Merchandise
§ 141.1
Liability of importer for duties.
(a)
Time duties accrue.
Duties and the liability for their payment accrue upon imported merchandise on arrival of the importing vessel within a Customs port with the intent then and there to unlade, or at the time of arrival within the Customs territory of the United States if the merchandise arrives otherwise than by vessel, unless otherwise specially provided for by law.
(b)
Payment of duties
—(1)
Personal debt of importer.
The liability for duties, both regular and additional, attaching on importation, constitutes a personal debt due from the importer to the United States which can be discharged only by payment in full of all duties legally accruing, unless relieved by law or regulation. Payment to a broker covering duties does not relieve the importer of liability if the duties are not paid by the broker. The liability may be enforced notwithstanding the fact that an erroneous construction of law or regulation may have enabled the importer to pass his goods through the customhouse without payment. Delivery of a Customs bond with an entry is solely to protect the revenue of the United States and does not relieve the importer of liabilities incurred from the importation of merchandise into the United States.
(2)
Means of payment.
An importer or his agent may pay Customs by using any of the applicable means provided in § 24.1(a).
(3)
Methods of payment.
An importer may pay duties either:
(i) Directly to Customs whether or not a licensed customhouse broker is used; or
(ii) Through a licensed customhouse broker. When an importer uses a broker and elects to pay by check or bank draft, the importer may issue the broker either:
(A) One check or bank draft payable to the broker covering both duties and the broker's fees and charges, in which case the broker shall pay the duties to Customs on behalf of the importer, or
(B) Separate checks or bank drafts, one covering duties payable to the “U.S. Customs Service,” for transmittal by the broker to Customs, and the other covering the broker's fees and charges. The importer's check or bank draft for duties shall be delivered to Customs by the broker.
(c)
Claim against estate of importer.
The claim of the Government for unpaid duties against the estate of a deceased or insolvent importer has priority over obligations to creditors other than the United States. To the extent that a broker or a surety pays duties on behalf of an importer which files for bankruptcy protection, the broker or surety shall be entitled to assume the priority status of Customs under section 507(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code for that portion of Customs claim which the surety or broker has paid.
(d)
Lien against merchandise.
The liability for duties also constitutes a lien upon the merchandise imported which may be enforced while such merchandise is in the custody or subject to the control of the United States.
(e)
States and their instrumentalities.
Neither the States nor their instrumentalities are entitled to any constitutional exemption from the payment of Customs duties.
(f)
Unordered merchandise.
There shall be no liability for the payment of duties on the part of anyone to whom merchandise is consigned without his authority, if he refuses it. Such merchandise shall be treated as unclaimed (see part 27 of this chapter).
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17447, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 82-134, 47 FR 32419, July 27, 1982; T.D. 92-58, 57 FR 27160, June 18, 1992; T.D. 97-82, 62 FR 51770, Oct. 3, 1997]
§ 141.2
Liability for duties on reimportation.
Dutiable merchandise imported and afterwards exported, even though duty thereon may have been paid on the first importation, is liable to duty on every subsequent importation into the Customs territory of the United States, but this does not apply to the following:
(a) Personal and household effects taken abroad by a resident of the United States and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.31 of this chapter);
(b) Professional books, implements, instruments, and tools of trade, occupation, or employment taken abroad by an individual and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.53 of this chapter);
(c) Automobiles and other vehicles taken abroad for noncommercial use (see § 148.32 of this chapter);
(d) Metal boxes, casks, barrels, carboys, bags, quicksilver flasks or bottles, metal drums, or other substantial outer containers exported from the United States empty and returned as usual containers or coverings of merchandise, or exported filled with products of the United States and returned empty or as the usual containers or coverings of merchandise (see § 10.7(b), (c), (d), and (e) of this chapter);

Merchandise not released directly to carrier.
Except where merchandise is released directly to the carrier in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, one of the following types of evidence of the right to make entry shall be filed in connection with the entry of merchandise imported by common carrier:
(1) A bill of lading or air waybill, presented by the holder thereof, properly endorsed when endorsement is required under the law. A nonnegotiable bill of lading, or air waybill, may not be endorsed by the named consignee to give someone else the right to make entry. If the person making entry intends to use the original bill of lading or air waybill to obtain a duplicate bill of lading, duplicate air waybill, or carrier's certificate from the carrier, the exchange shall be made before the entry is filed, and the duplicate bill of lading, duplicate air waybill, or carrier's certificate shall be used to make entry in accordance with paragraph (a)
(3) or (4) of this section. For purposes of this part, the rights of the consignor relating to an air waybill as prescribed by the Warsaw Convention (49 Stat. 3017) shall be protected.
(2) An extract from a bill of lading or air waybill certified to be genuine by the carrier bringing the merchandise to the port of entry. Customs officers shall not certify extracts from bills of lading or air waybills.

The rubber-stamped or typewritten certificate shall be in substantially the following form, which may be varied to include any of the qualifications on release shown in § 141.111(d):
Date ____________
The undersigned carrier, to whom or upon whose order the articles described herein or in the attached document must be released, hereby certifies that the consignee named in this document is the owner or consignee of such articles within the purview of section 484(h), Tariff Act of 1930.

(b)
Merchandise released directly to carrier.
Where, in accordance with subsection (j) of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), merchandise is released from Customs custody (either under immediate delivery procedures in accordance with the provisions of subpart C of part 142 of this chapter, or after an entry has been filed in accordance with subpart A of part 142 of this chapter, or after an entry summary, which shall serve as both the entry and entry summary has been filed with estimated duties attached where appropriate in accordance with subpart B of part 142 of this chapter), to the carrier by whom the merchandise was brought to the port, the delivery of the merchandise by the carrier to the person filing the entry summary with estimated duties attached shall be deemed to be the certification required by subsection (h), section 484, Tariff Act of 1930. Customs responsibility under this optional entry procedure is limited to the collection of duties, and constitutes no representation whatsoever regarding the right of any person to obtain possession of the merchandise from the carrier. Consequently, no Customs official shall be liable to any person in respect to the delivery of merchandise released from Customs custody in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

Underwriters of abandoned merchandise or salvors of merchandise saved from a wreck who are unable to produce a bill of lading, air waybill, certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, or carrier's certificate, shall produce evidence satisfactory to the port director of their right to act.

The bond shall be for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, unless the person making entry intends to produce a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. In that case, no bond is required because section 484(c) does not apply to entries made on a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. If the port director is in doubt as to the propriety of accepting entry on a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, he shall request authority to do so from the Commissioner of Customs.

The bond shall be on Customs Form 301 and contain the bond conditions set forth in § 113.69 of this chapter.

The receipt shall also show any freight charges and weights that appear on the bill of lading or air waybill. The port director shall then return the bill of lading or air waybill to the person making entry with a notation thereon to the effect that entry has been made for the merchandise.

(2)
Other agents.
When entry is made in a consignee's name by an agent who does not meet the qualifications in paragraph (b)(1) of this section either:

(ii) A charge for the production of the declaration shall be made against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter.

—(1)
Declaration of owner.
A consignee in whose name an entry summary for consumption, warehouse, or temporary importation under bond is filed, or in whose name a rewarehouse entry or a manufacturing warehouse entry is made, and who desires, under the provisions of section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), to be relieved from statutory liability for the payment of increased and additional duties shall declare at the time of the filing of the entry summary or entry documentation, as provided in § 141.19(a), that he is not the actual owner of the merchandise, furnish the name and address of the owner, and file with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically within 90 days from the time of entry (see § 141.68) a declaration of the actual owner of the merchandise acknowledging that the actual owner will pay all additional and increased duties.

Filing of declaration of owner for purposes other than relief from liability.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the nominal consignee from filing the actual owner's declaration without the superseding bond for purposes other than relief from statutory liability for the payment of increased and additional duties under the provisions of section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)).

[T.D. 79-221, 44 FR 46817, Aug. 9, 1979]
§ 141.57
Single entry for split shipments.
(a)
At election of importer of record.
At the election of the importer of record, Customs may process a split shipment, pursuant to section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), under a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.
(b)
Split shipment defined.
A “split shipment”, for purposes of this section, means a shipment:
(1) Which may be accommodated on a single conveyance, and which is delivered to and accepted by a carrier in the exporting country under one bill of lading or waybill, and is thus intended by the importer of record to arrive in the United States as a single shipment;
(2) Which is thereafter divided by the carrier, acting on its own, into different portions which are transported and consigned to the same party in the United States; and
(3) Of which the first portion and all succeeding portions arrive at the same port of entry in the United States, as listed in the original bill of lading or waybill; and all the succeeding portions arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the date of the first portion. If any portion of the shipment arrives at a different port, such portion must be transported in-bond to the port of destination where entry of the shipment is made.
(c)
Notification by importer of record.
The importer of record must notify Customs, in writing, that the shipment has been split at the carrier's initiative, that the remainder of the shipment will arrive by subsequent conveyance(s), and that an election is being made to file a single entry for all portions. The required notification must be given as soon as the importer of record becomes aware that the shipment has been split, but in all cases notification must be made before the entry summary is filed.
(d)
Entry or special permit for immediate delivery.
In order to make a single entry for a split shipment or obtain a special permit for the release of a split shipment under immediate delivery, an importer of record may follow the procedure prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.
(1)
Entry or special permit after arrival of entire shipment.
An importer of record may file an entry at such time as all portions of the split shipment have arrived at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section). In the alternative, again after the arrival of all portions of a split shipment at the port of entry, the importer of record may instead file a special permit for immediate delivery provided that the merchandise is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(f) and (h) of this chapter. In either case, the importer of record must file Customs Form (CF) 3461 or CF 3461 alternate (CF 3461 ALT) as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, with Customs. The entry or special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment.
(2)
Special permit prior to arrival of entire shipment.
As provided in § 142.21(g) of this chapter, an importer of record may also file a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of a split shipment at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section), but before the arrival of the entire shipment at such port, thus qualifying the split shipment for incremental release, under paragraph (e) of this section, as each portion of the shipment arrives at the port of entry (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section). In such case, a CF 3461 or CF 3461 ALT as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, must be filed with Customs. As each portion arrives at the port of entry, the importer of record must submit a copy of the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or its electronic equivalent, adjusted to reflect the quantity of that particular portion relative to the quantity contained in the entire split shipment (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); however, if both the carrier and the importer of record are automated, such adjustments may instead be made electronically to the CBP Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system. In the event that an entry has been pre-filed with Customs (see § 142.2(b) of this chapter), notification to Customs by the importer of record that a single entry will be filed for shipments released incrementally will serve as a request that the pre-filed entry be converted to an application for a special permit for immediate delivery (see § 142.21(g) of this chapter). The special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment. Customs may limit the release of each portion of the split shipment upon arrival at the port of entry, as permitted under this paragraph, due to the need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Release.
To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a split shipment at the port of destination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the carrier responsible for initially splitting the shipment must present to Customs, either on a paper manifest or through an authorized electronic data interchange system, manifest information relating to the shipment that reflects exact information for each portion of the split shipment. The carrier responsible for splitting the shipment must notify other obligated entities (such as another carrier or freight forwarder) that have submitted electronic manifest information to Customs about the shipment that was split so that these parties can update their manifest information to Customs.
(f)
Examination.
Customs may require examination of any or all parts of the split shipment. For split shipments subject to the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, Customs reserves the right to deny incremental release should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(g)
Entry summary
—(1)
Entry.
For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file an entry summary within 10 working days from the time of entry.
(2)
Release for immediate delivery
—(i)
Release under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery
pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days after the merchandise or any part of the merchandise is authorized for release under the special permit or, for quota class merchandise, within the quota period, whichever expires first (see § 142.23 of this chapter).
(ii)
Release under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the split shipment. The filed entry summary must reflect all portions of the split shipment which have been released, to include quantity, value, correct classification and rate of duty. The entry summary cannot include any portions of the split shipment which have not been released.
(3)
Duty payment.
With the entry summary filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the importer of record must attach estimated duties, taxes and fees applicable to the released merchandise. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse (see § 24.25 of this chapter).
(h)
Classification.
For purposes of section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of a split shipment included on one entry will be classified as though imported together.
(i)
Separate entry required
—(1)
Untimely arrival.
The importer of record must enter separately those portions of a split shipment that do not arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the portion that arrived there first (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
(2)
Different rates of duty for identically classified merchandise.
An importer of record will be required to file a separate entry for any portion of a split shipment if necessary to preclude the application of different rates of duty on a split shipment entry for merchandise that is classifiable under the same subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).
(j)
Requirement of importer of record to review entry and maintain evidence substantiating splitting of shipment
—(1)
Review of entry.
The importer of record will be responsible for reviewing the total manifested quantity shown on the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, in relation to all portions of the split shipment that arrived at the port of entry under paragraph (b)(3) of this section within the specified 10 calendar day period. At the conclusion of the specified 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must make any adjustments necessary to reflect the actual amount, value, correct classification and rate of duty of the merchandise that was released incrementally under the split shipment procedures. If all portions of the split shipment do not arrive within the required 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must file an additional entry or entries as appropriate to cover any remaining portions of the split shipment that subsequently arrive (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section).
(2)
Evidence for splitting of shipment; recordkeeping.
The importer of record must maintain sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier acting on its own, and not at the request of the foreign shipper and/or the importer of record. This documentation should include a copy of the originating bill of lading or waybill under which the shipment was delivered to the carrier in the country of exportation or other supporting documentary evidence, such as a letter from the carrier confirming that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier on its own initiative. This documentary evidence as well as all other necessary records received or generated by or on behalf of the importer of record under this section must be maintained and produced, if requested, in accordance with part 163 of this chapter.
(k)
Single entry limited; exclusions from single entry under incremental release
procedure
—(1)
Quota/visa merchandise.
Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is excluded from incremental release under the immediate delivery procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter. Additionally, if by splitting a shipment any portion of it is subject to quota, no portion of the split shipment may be released incrementally.
(2)
Other merchandise.
In addition, the port director may deny the use of the incremental release procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, as circumstances warrant.
(3)
Limited single entry available.
For merchandise described in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, that is excluded from the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, the importer of record may still file a single entry or special permit for immediate delivery under paragraph (d)(1) of this section covering the entire split shipment of such merchandise following, and to the extent of, its arrival within the required 10 calendar day period.
[T.D. 03-09, 68 FR 8719, Feb. 25, 2003, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61288, Oct. 13, 2015; 80 FR 65135, Oct. 26, 2015]
§ 141.58
Single entry for separately arriving portions of unassembled or disassembled entities.
(a)
At election of importer of record.
At the election of the importer of record, an unassembled or disassembled entity arriving on multiple conveyances as contemplated under section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), may be processed as a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.
(b)
Unassembled or disassembled entities covered.
An unassembled or disassembled entity for purposes of this section is an entity which:
(1) Cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on a single conveyance, and is thus imported in an unassembled or disassembled condition;
(2) Is ordered, invoiced and is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as a single entity and is consigned to one person in the United States;
(3) Is imported on more than one conveyance to the same port of entry in the United States; and
(4) Involves the first portion and all succeeding portions arriving at the same United States port of entry within either:
(i) 15 calendar days after the unlading of the first portion or arrival at the destination port if transported in bond for entities entered under the “hold all” method permitted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
(ii) 10 calendar days after the release of the first portion under special permit procedures for entities released incrementally as permitted in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(c)
Application by importer.
The importer of record must apply to file a single entry covering an entity described in paragraph (b) of this section. Applications may be made either by appropriately annotating a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form 3461, CBP Form 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, or by submitting a letter to CBP. The required application must be made no later than 5 working days in advance of the arrival of the first conveyance. Justification for the need for more than one conveyance must be provided in the application, which must include an affirmative statement that the entity cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on one conveyance. A copy of the relevant invoice or purchase order, or electronic equivalent, must accompany the application, along with the proposed appropriate single tariff number under the HTSUS. The port director will notify the applicant of the approval or denial of the application within 3 working days of the receipt of the application.
(d)
Entry or special permit for immediate delivery.
In order to make a single entry for portions of an entity covered under this section that arrive at different times, an importer of record must follow the procedure prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.
(1)
Entry or special permit after arrival of all portions (Hold All).
An importer may file an entry at such time as all portions of the entity have arrived at
the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made. In the alternative, the importer may file a special permit for immediate delivery after arrival of all portions of the entity provided that it is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(d), (f) and (i) of this chapter.
(2)
Special permit for immediate delivery after arrival of first portion (Incremental Release).
As provided in § 142.21(h) of this chapter, an importer of record may file an application for a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of the entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section, and its remaining portions may be released incrementally pursuant to the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. All portions of the shipment must timely arrive at the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made.
(e)
Release.
If an importer wishes to secure release of an entity under paragraph (d)(1) of this section after the entity's arrival, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent. To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a shipment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent after arrival of the first portion. As each successive portion arrives, the importer must submit a copy of the originally submitted CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT, annotated to specifically identify that particular portion. The CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT must indicate the order of the arriving portion in relation to the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice (for example, third of six portions). If both the carrier and the importer are automated, such adjustments may be made electronically through the CBP Automated Commercial System (ACS). The release of each portion upon arrival as permitted under this paragraph may be restricted due to CBP's need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the importer of record must present to CBP either on paper or through an authorized electronic equivalent, specific and detailed information supplementing the CBP Form 3461 or 3461 ALT, relating to the merchandise on each conveyance which reflects exact information for that portion of the ordered entity (for example, detailed packing lists).
(f)
Examination.
CBP may require examination of any or all portions of the entity. CBP reserves the right to deny the release of each portion of such shipments as they arrive (
i.e.
, incremental release) should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(g)
Entry summary.
(1) For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an entry summary must be filed within 10 working days from the time of entry. For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days after the first portion of the entity is authorized for release under the special permit.
(2) For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the unassembled or disassembled entity. However, the entry/entry summary for the entity cannot be filed before the last portion of the entity which is to be included on the entry has arrived.
(3)
Duty payment.
At the time the entry summary is filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, estimated duties, taxes and fees must be attached. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse procedures (
see
19 CFR 24.25).
(h)
Classification.
Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, for purposes of section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of an entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section included on one entry will be classified as though imported together. Any spare parts accompanying a portion of an entity must be classified and entered separately.
(i)
When separate entry and entry summary required.
When all portions of an entity do not arrive at the port of entry within the time constraints of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable, a separate entry and entry summary must be filed for each portion that has already arrived, and for each portion that subsequently will arrive on separate conveyances. The merchandise included on each separate entry shall be classified in its condition as imported. Each entry would reflect the quantities, values, classifications and rates of duty, as appropriate, of the various components conveyed in each shipment, and not the value or classification of the ordered single entity.
(j)
Exclusions.
Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is entirely excluded from the procedures set forth in this section. Also, CBP reserves the right for the port director to deny use of the incremental release procedure and only release the shipment in its entirety as circumstances warrant, such as in the case where a particular shipment has been selected for examination.

Statistical information
—(1)
Information required on entry summary or withdrawal form
—(i)
Where form provides space
—(A)
Single invoice.
For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), must be shown on the entry summary, CBP Form 7501. The applicable information must also be shown on the in-bond application filed pursuant to part 18 of this chapter when it is used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third country pursuant to an entry for transportation and exportation, or immediate exportation.

) list each invoice separately on the appropriate form listed under paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section and for each class or kind of merchandise within each invoice subject to a separate statistical reporting number, report the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, HTSUS; or (
2
) combine the information for each class or kind of merchandise and report it under one statistical reporting number for all invoices. When consolidating information from several invoices under one reporting number, a worksheet itemizing the entered value of the merchandise from each invoice in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section must be attached to the appropriate form.
(ii)
Where form does not provide space.
In addition to the information required by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, statistical information for which spaces are not provided on the appropriate form, must be shown as follows:

cannot be obtained readily, the person filing the form must provide reasonable estimates of the required information. The acceptance of an estimate for a particular transaction does not relieve the person filing the form from obtaining the necessary information for similar future transactions. The Center director may require additional documentation to substantiate the statistical information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The importer must give an appropriate bond for the production of the required documentation, as follows:
(i) Except for merchandise entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary (or the entry, if there is no entry summary) is required to be filed.
(ii) If merchandise is entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 2 months after the date of withdrawal, except that if an invoice is part of the documentation, the invoice must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary for warehouse is required to be filed.
The Center director may grant a reasonable extension of time to produce the required documentation for good cause shown. (See § 141.91(d) for bond requirements relating to failure to produce an invoice.)
(3)
Estimates of statistical information.
When the person filing the form estimates any of the values or charges, as provided for in General Statistical Note 1(b)(ii), HTSUS, except Canadian rail and truck charges, he must place either “(estimate)”, “(est)”, or (“E”) after the amount of each value or charge.
(4)
Rejection of form.
The Center director will reject a form for failure to provide required statistical information if the information is omitted or if the information provided clearly appears on its face, or is known to the CBP officer, to be erroneous.
(5)
Penalty procedures; when not invoked.
Penalty procedures relating to erroneous statistical information will not be invoked against any person who in good faith attempts to comply with the statistical requirements of the General Statistical Note, HTSUS.
(f)
Value of each invoice
—(1)
Single invoice.
If the entry, entry summary, or withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice information must be restated to show:
(i) Gross amount of the invoice;
(ii) Deduction of the aggregate amount of any non-dutiable charges involved in the amount;
(iii) Further deduction of the aggregate of any deductions from the invoice values to make entered values; and
(iv) Addition of the aggregate of any dutiable charges not included in the gross amount of the invoice and of any other additions to the invoice values to make entered values. The final amount in the summary computations must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise covered by the invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent and in the same general location on CBP Forms 7505, 7506.
(2)
Multiple invoices.
(i) If the importer or his agent elects the first option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.
(ii) If the importer or his agent elects the second option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The final amount in the summary computation must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise on each of the multiple invoices. The required information must be shown on an attached worksheet.
(iii) The worksheet also must contain:
(A) A statistical reporting number restatement for the merchandise from
each invoice subject to the same statistical reporting number from the same country of origin, and
(B) An aggregate total value which represents the entered value.
(iv) To permit the identification of the merchandise entered under each reporting number, each class or kind of merchandise, from one country reported under a single statistical reporting number must be coded identically on each invoice and on the worksheet.

Definitions
for some of the terms used in questions A to Z above: For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the approximate definitions below. If either a more complete definition or a decision as to its application to a particular article is needed, the maker or importer of record (or the agent of either) should contact Customs prior to entry of the article.
a. In an
exclusively adhesive construction,
all of the piece(s) of the bottom would separate from the upper or from each other if all adhesives, cements, and glues were dissolved. It includes shoes in which the pieces of the upper are stitched to each other, but not to any part of the bottom. Examples include:
1. Vulcanized construction footwear;
2. Simultaneous molded construction footwear;
3. Molded footwear in which the upper and the bottom are one piece of molded rubber or plastic, and
4. Footwear in which staples, rivets, stitching, or any of the methods above are either primary or just extra or auxiliary, even though adhesive is a major part of the reason the bottom will not separate from the upper.
b.
Composition leather
is made by binding together leather fibers or small pieces of natural leather. It does not include imitation leathers not based on natural leather.
c.
Leather
is the tanned skin of any animal from which the fur or hair has been removed. Tanned skins coated or laminated with rubber and/or plastics are “leather” only if the leather gives the material its essential character.
d. A
line of demarcation
exists if one can indicate where the sole ends and the upper begins. For example, knit booties do not normally have a line of demarcation.
e.
Men's, boys' and youths'
sizes cover footwear of American youths sizes 11
1/2
and larger for males, and do not include footwear commonly worn by both sexes. If more than 4% of the shoes sold in a given size will be worn by females, that size is “commonly worn by both sexes.”
f. Footwear is designed to
protect
against water, oil or cold or inclement weather only if it is substantially more of a protection against those items than the usual shoes of that type. For example, leather oxfords will clearly keep one's feet warmer and drier than going barefoot, but they are not a protection in this sense. On the other hand the snow-jobber is the protective version of the nonprotective jogging shoe.
g.
Rubber and/or plastics
includes any textile material visibly coated (or covered) externally with one or both of those materials.
h.
Slip-on
includes:
1. A boot which must be pulled on.
2. Footwear with elastic cores which must be stretched to get it on, but not bootwear having a separate piece of elasticized fabric which forms a full circle around the foot or ankle.
i.
Sports footwear
includes only:
(1) Footwear which is designed for a sporting activity and has, or has provision for, the attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, clips, bars or the like;
(2) Skating boots (without skates attached), ski boots and cross-country ski footwear, wrestling boots, boxing boots and cycling shoes.
j.
Tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like
covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear, whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.
k.
Textile materials
are made from cotton, other vegetable fibers, wool, hair, silk or man-made fibers. Note: Cork, wood carboard and leather are not textile materials.
l. In
turned
construction, the upper is stitched to the leather sole wrong side out and the shoe is then turned right side out.
m.
Vegetable fibers
include cotton, flax and ramie, but do not include either rayon or plaiting materials such as rattan or wood strips.
n.
Waterproof footwear
includes footwear designed to protect against penetration by water or other liquids, whether or not such footwear is primarily designed for such purposes.
o.
Welt footwear
means footwear constructed with a welt, which extends around the edge of the outer sole, and in which the welt and shoe upper are sewed to a lip on the surface of the insole, and the outer sole is sewed or cemented to the welt.
p. A
zori
has an upper consisting only of straps or thongs of molded rubber or plastic. This upper is assembled to a foamed rubber or plastic sole by means of plugs.

the merchandise in order for the extension of the conditional release period to be valid.
(3)

If FDA refuses admission of a food, drug, device, cosmetic, or tobacco product into the United States, or if any notice of sampling or other request is not complied with, FDA will communicate that fact to the Center director. An authorized CBP official will demand the redelivery of the product to CBP custody. CBP will issue a notice of redelivery within 30 days from the date the product was refused admission by the FDA or from the date FDA determined the noncompliance with a notice of sampling or other request. The demand for redelivery may be made contemporaneously with the notice of refusal issued by the FDA. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, a failure to comply with a demand for redelivery made under this paragraph (c) will result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of the merchandise involved unless the port director has prescribed a bond equal to the domestic value of the merchandise pursuant to § 12.3(b) of this Chapter.
(d)
Other merchandise not entitled to admission.
If at any time after entry an authorized CBP official finds that any merchandise contained in an importation is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States for any reason not enumerated in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, an authorized CBP official shall promptly demand the return to CBP custody of any such merchandise which has been released.
(e)

(g)
Form of demand.
A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall be made on Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, or other appropriate form, or by letter. One copy, with the date of mailing or delivery noted thereon, shall be retained by an authorized CBP official and made part of the entry record.
(h)
Time limitation.
A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall not be made after the liquidation of the entry covering such merchandise has become final.
(i)
Demand not complied with.
When the demand of an authorized CBP official for return of merchandise to CBP custody is not complied with, liquidated damages shall be assessed, except in the case of merchandise entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise not returned or three times the value of the merchandise not returned if the merchandise is restricted or prohibited merchandise or alcoholic beverages, as determined at the time of entry.

# Subpart C—Special Permit for Immediate Delivery
§ 142.21
Merchandise eligible for special permit for immediate delivery.
Merchandise may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery, in accordance with section 448(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), in the following circumstances:
(a)
Contiguous countries.
At the discretion of the port director, merchandise arriving by land from Canada or Mexico may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. An entry summary shall be filed in accordance with § 142.22(b)(1), and estimated duties, if any, shall be deposited,
within the time period specified in § 142.23 for all merchandise from contiguous countries released under a special permit except for fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption released under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Fresh fruits and vegetables.
(1) An application for a special permit for immediate delivery may be made for the transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption arriving from Canada or Mexico to the importer's premises within the port of importation, but removed from the area immediately contiguous to the border.
(2) The application shall be accompanied by a continuous bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter.
(3) The fresh fruits and vegetables shall be transported to the importer's premises in the vehicles in which they crossed the border or, if transshipment is necessary in vehicles provided by the importer. The fresh fruits and vegetables may be examined at the importer's premises. Those portions without commercial value may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § 158.11(b) of this chapter, and the balance shall be entered for consumption or transported in bond under an entry for immediate transportation without appraisement or under an entry for transportation and exportation.
(c)
Agency of U.S. Government.
Merchandise may be released under the immediate delivery procedure if the shipment is consigned to or for the account of any agency or office of the United States Government, or to an officer or official of any such agency in his official capacity, as provided in § 10.101 of this chapter.
(d)
Articles of a trade fair.
Articles for a trade fair may be released under the immediate delivery procedure, as provided in § 147.13 of this chapter.
(e)
Quota-class merchandise
—(1)
Tariff rate quotas.
At the discretion of the port director, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to 19 CFR 141.58(d)(1). Where a special permit is authorized, an entry summary will be properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If proper presentation is not made until after the tariff-rate quota is filled, the merchandise shall not be entitled to the quota rate of duty, and the importer shall pay duties at the over-quota rate.
(2)
Absolute quotas.
At the discretion of the port director, perishable merchandise of a class approved by CBP Headquarters which is subject to an absolute quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery for removal to the importer's premises, or to any other location approved by the port director, until an entry summary is properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to an absolute quota under this paragraph may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to § 141.58(d)(1) of this chapter. Where a special permit is authorized, a proper entry summary must be presented for merchandise so released within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If the absolute quota is filled before the importer has properly presented an entry summary, he may either present an entry summary for warehouse or, under CBP supervision, export or destroy the merchandise.
(f)
Release from warehouse followed by warehouse withdrawal for consumption.
Merchandise may be released from warehouse under a special permit:
(1) At the discretion of the port director when:
(i) The warehouse is located a considerable distance from the customhouse and actual release of the merchandise from the warehouse may not be effected within the next full business day
after the day of the payment of duty, and
(ii) The port has sufficient manpower to permit such practice;
(2) The importer shall have on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter; and
(3) The immediate delivery permit shall be annotated to state that a warehouse withdrawal for consumption will be filed for this merchandise.
(g)
Split shipments.
Merchandise subject to § 141.57(d)(2) of this chapter, which is invoiced and delivered to the carrier as a single shipment, but which, due to the carrier's inability to accommodate the merchandise on a single conveyance, is shipped by the carrier in separate portions to the same port of entry in the United States as listed on the original bill of lading, may be released incrementally under a special permit. Incremental release means releasing each portion of such shipments separately as they arrive.
(h)
Entities shipped unassembled or disassembled on multiple conveyances.
Merchandise subject to § 141.58(d)(2) of this chapter, which is purchased, invoiced, and classified as a single entity under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and which is shipped in separate portions because its size or nature prevents shipping the entity on a single conveyance, may be released incrementally under a special permit.
(i)
When authorized by Headquarters.
Headquarters may authorize the release of merchandise under the immediate delivery procedure in circumstances other than those described in § 142.21(a) through (h) provided a bond on CBP Form 301 containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter is on file.

A commercial invoice will not be required, except for merchandise released under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1484(j). Instead of a commercial invoice, the importer may deliver to CBP a pro forma invoice, waybill, or other document setting forth an adequate description of the merchandise and the quantities, together with the values or approximate values when values are needed for the purpose of examination. If the merchandise is to be released under a term special permit, the documentation also shall show the term special permit number, as provided for in § 142.24.

(2) A withdrawal for consumption, with estimated duties attached, which shall be filed only for merchandise released from warehouse under § 142.21(f) of this part;
(3) An entry for transportation and exportation, immediate transportation without appraisement, or direct exportation, which shall be filed in those circumstances under § 142.21(b) and (e)(2) of this part; or entry for transportation and exportation, or direct exportation,

T.D. 92-93, 57 FR 44093, Sept. 24, 1992, unless otherwise noted.
§ 142.41
Line Release.
Line Release is an automated system designed to release and tract repetitive shipments. It is a method of entry or
immediate delivery extended to importers of merchandise which CBP deems to be repetitive and high volume. Line Release may be used only at locations approved by CBP for handling Line Release. At certain high-risk locations along the land borders of the United States (the locations to be published in the
Federal Register
), which are approved by CBP for handling Line Release, the use of Line Release for particular shipments may be denied by CBP unless the imported merchandise is transported by carriers that participate in a CBP-approved industry partnership program.
[T.D. 92-93, 57 FR 44093, as amended by T.D. 99-2, 64 FR 33, Jan. 4, 1999; CBP Dec. 11-04, 76 FR 6690, Feb. 8, 2011]
§ 142.42
Application for Line Release processing.
In order to obtain approval for processing import transactions through Line Release, a broker or importer filing its own entries (entry filer) must submit an application to the port director, signed by the entry filer, in a format described as a Line Release Data Loading Sheet. The application must be accompanied by a representative sample of an actual commercial invoice for the products sought to be processed under Line Release. The Line Release Data Loading Sheet must contain the following information with each information element appearing on a separate line.
(a) Port where application is being made.
(b) Initiating Company Information: name, address, city, state, contact person, phone number of contact person, and signature.
(c) Listing of all ports in which the initiating company has filed a similar application for Line Release.
(d) Country of origin codes (ISO codes from Annex B of HTSUS) for the merchandise.
(e) Shipper or manufacturer information: Name, address, city, province/state, country, postal code, indication by noting “M” or “S” whether this information relates to a manufacturer (M) or a shipper (S), and manufacturer identification number of the shipper or manufacturer.
(f) Importer information (if importer is different than filer): Name, address, city, state and country, zip code, importer number, bond number, and surety code.
(g) Entry filer information: Name, importer number, filer code, bond number, and surety code.
(h) Product information: Product description, manifest unit of measure, HTSUS number described to sub-heading level for particular product or range of HTSUS numbers at sub-heading levels for multiple products for which Line Release is sought.
(i) Election of whether the Line Release transaction is to be considered an entry or an immediate delivery.
§ 142.43
Line Release application approval process.
(a)
Port review.
The port director shall review each Line Release application to determine whether the shipments qualify for Line Release processing. The port director may contact the applicant for further information, if necessary. An application that fails to elect whether the Line Release transaction is to be considered an entry or an immediate delivery will be returned to the applicant. If all required information is submitted, the application will be forwarded to Headquarters for final processing.
(b)
Assignment of C-4 Codes.
A C-4 Code (Common Commodity Classification Code), which is a unique code identifying the shipper or manufacturer, importer, entry filer, and the product for each Line Release shipment, shall be assigned by Headquarters to each application approved for Line Release. Headquarters shall annotate each approved application with a C-4 Code and return the application to the port director who shall return the approved application to the entry filer.
(c)
Denial of Line Release application.
If the port director is considering the denial of a Line Release application, consideration shall be given to whether an application by the same filer for the same transaction has been approved at another port. If there is not an approved application at another port and the port director determines that the
application shall be denied, the application shall be noted denied and returned to the entry filer without a C-4 Code annotation by the port director. If an application has been approved at another port, but the port director still questions whether the application should be approved at his port, the port director shall forward the application to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Information Management. The Office of Information and Technology will review the application and will notify the port director of the final determination.
§ 142.44
Entry number range.
After an application for Line Release has received final approval, filers must provide the port director, in writing, with a range of entry numbers for use in the system so that an entry number can be assigned automatically to each Line Release transaction. For the purposes of this subpart, “entry number”, when the release is an immediate delivery, merely refers to the Line Release transaction number; this number does not become the actual entry number until an entry for the merchandise released under the immediate delivery procedure is filed. A separate range must be provided for each Line Release site at the port. These entry numbers shall be used for assignment within the Line Release system. Entry filers shall not assign these numbers to other entry transactions.
§ 142.45
Use of bar code by entry filer.
(a)
Printing of C-4 Code.
Upon receipt of an approved Line Release application, the entry filer, in accordance with instructions from the port director, shall preprint invoices with the C-4 Code in bar code and alpha-numeric format or print labels with the necessary information. Bar codes shall be printed in accordance with the specifications stated in Customs Publication 561 (
Line Release Overview
). Labels or preprinted invoices also shall state the name of the shipper or manufacturer of the product and the name of the importer of record, if other than the entry filer, above the bar code and the name of the entry filer and a product description below the bar code.
(b)
Multiple commodity processing.
Multiple commodity processing allows more than one product to be released under one entry number. The shipper/manufacturer, importer of record and the entry filer must be the same. The product description is the only variable allowed. The commodities should be listed on one invoice with C-4 Code labels for each commodity attached to the invoice.
(c)
Distribution of labels.
If labels are used, the labels shall be affixed to the invoices in accordance with instructions from the port director. The entry filer may either affix the labels or distribute the labels to the shippers/manufacturers and instruct them in the use and placement of the labels.
§ 142.46
Presentation of invoice and assignment of entry number.
(a)
Presentation of invoice.
When merchandise that has been approved for Line Release is imported at a Line Release site, the carrier, importer or filer shall present Customs with an invoice with the bar code or codes printed or affixed and, according to the method of transportation, the appropriate manifest document.
(b)
Verification of data.
If after scanning the bar code at the Line Release site, the Customs officer verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice, he will key the quantity on the invoice and an entry number will be automatically assigned to the transaction. If there are any differences between the system data and the invoice and bar code, including any differences in entry filer, the Customs officer shall order an examination.
(c)
Other agency documentation.
If the Line Release shipment requires other agency documentation, the Customs officer at the Line Release site will be alerted to that requirement electronically when he verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice. If the required form is presented to the officer with the documentation package, the shipment may be released.
§ 142.47
Examinations of Line Release transactions.
(a)
General.
Merchandise imported under Line Release generally may be
released without further CBP processing. CBP, however, may choose to inspect any Line Release shipment. Examinations may be either specifically ordered by the CBP officer or random.
(b)
Voiding of Line Release transaction.
CBP may void a Line Release transaction for the following reasons: Because of an examination, because a carrier transporting the Line Release merchandise is not a participant in a CBP-approved industry partnership program, or because a driver or conveyance is not authorized in accordance with the LBCIP. If this occurs, CBP will return the invoice to the carrier, and the entry filer, in order to enter merchandise, must prepare and submit either a CF 3461 or 3461 Alternate, or its electronic equivalent.
[T.D. 92-93, 57 FR 44093, Sept. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 99-2, 64 FR 33, Jan. 4, 1999; CBP Dec. 11-04, 76 FR 6690, Feb. 8, 2011; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61289, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 142.48
Release procedure.
(a)
General.
When the Customs officer at the Line Release site determines that a shipment is ready for release, release data, consisting of the entry number, the date and time of release, the inspector's badge number, the quantity and unit of measure, and the C-4 Code will be printed on the invoice and the manifest document and, when other agency documentation is presented, may be printed on that documentation. The invoice shall be returned to the entry filer and the manifest document shall be retained by Customs.
(b)
Notification to non-ABI participants.
The returned invoice with the release data shall be the release notification to non-ABI participants.
(c)
Notification to ABI participants.
If the Line Release entry filer is an operational ABI participant, the filer shall receive an electronic notification of the release consisting of the importer of record number, the port of entry, the filer code, the entry number, the date and time of release, the manufacturer code, the quantity and unit of measure, the release site, the HTSUS number(s), the C-4 Code and the country or countries of origin.
§ 142.49
Deletion of C-4 Code.
(a)
By Customs.
A port director may temporarily or permanently delete an entry filer's C-4 Code without providing the participant with any justification and without prior notification in cases of willfulness or when public health, interest, or safety so requires, thereby revoking the filer's use of Line Release.
(b)
By entry filer.
Entry filers may delete C-4 Codes from Line Release by notifying the port director in writing on a Deletion Data Loading Sheet. Such notification shall state the C-4 Code which is to be deleted, the port where the C-4 Code is to be deleted and the reason for the requested deletion. A copy of the originally approved Data Loading Sheet must be submitted with the Deletion Data Loading Sheet. If only a temporary deletion is desired, the filer shall state the requested effective date for the deletion and the date the C-4 Code is requested to be returned to Line Release processing.
§ 142.50
Line Release data base corrections or changes.
The applicant shall notify the port director of any changes in names, importer or filer numbers or bond information on a Line Release Data Loading Sheet as soon as possible. Notification shall be accomplished by the submission of a copy of the original loading sheet with a Correction Data Loading Sheet.
§ 142.51
Changing election of entry or immediate delivery.
An applicant who has already received a C-4 Code and wishes to change the election chosen on his Line Release application as to whether the release should be considered an entry or an immediate delivery must submit a letter requesting such change to the port director where the C-4 Code is used. This letter must include the C-4 Code to be changed and the date the change is to be effective. If the requested change is for a temporary time period, the letter shall include the date the releases are to return to the release type originally requested. Applications that fail to state the effective dates of the changes requested will be returned to the applicant.
§ 142.52
Port-wide and multiple port acceptance of Line Release.
(a)
Port-wide processing.
If a C-4 Code has been approved by the port director, the C-4 Code may be used at any Line Release site at the port.
(b)
Multiple port processing.
In order for a C-4 Code approved at one port to be used at another port, the entry filer must submit an application to the port director of the other port. While uniform criteria shall be applied to approving similar shipments for Line Release at all ports, a port director may exercise his discretion to deny Line Release at his port even though a similar shipment may be approved at another port.

# Subpart A—Automated Broker Interface

# Source:
T.D. 90-92, 55 FR 49884, Dec. 3, 1990, unless otherwise noted.
§ 143.1
Eligibility.
The Automated Broker Interface (ABI) allows participants to transmit
data electronically to CBP through ABI and to receive transmissions from Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system. Its purposes are to improve administrative efficiency, enhance enforcement of customs and related laws, lower costs and expedite the release of cargo.
(a)
Participants for entry and entry summary purposes.
Participants in ABI for the purposes of transmitting data relating to entry and entry summary may be:
(1) Customs brokers as defined in § 111.1 of this chapter;
(2) Importers as defined in § 101.1 of this chapter; and
(3) ABI service bureaus, that is, an individual, partnership, association or corporation which provides communications facilities and data processing services for brokers and importers, but which does not engage in the conduct of customs business as defined in § 111.1 of this chapter.
(b)
Participants for Importer Security Filing purposes.
Any party may participate in ABI solely for the purposes of filing the Importer Security Filing pursuant to § 149.2 of this chapter if that party fulfills the eligibility requirements contained in § 149.5 of this chapter. If a party other than a customs broker as defined in § 111.1 of this chapter or an importer as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1484 submits the Importer Security Filing, no portion of the Importer Security Filing can be used for entry or entry summary purposes pursuant to § 149.5 of this chapter.
(c)
Participants for other purposes.
Upon approval by CBP, any party may participate in ABI for other purposes, including transmission of protests, filing of in-bond applications, and applications for FTZ admission (CBP Form 214).
[CBP Dec. 08-46, 73 FR 71782, Nov. 25, 2008, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61290, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. 17-13, 82 FR 45406, Sept. 28, 2017]

§ 143.4
Confidentiality of data.
The electronic data received and exchanged by a service bureau shall be considered confidential, and the service bureau shall maintain the accuracy of data received in the process of formatting and transmitting such data on behalf of a filer, and shall not disclose this data or any information connected therewith to any persons other than the filer or Customs (see § 111.24 of this chapter).
§ 143.5
System performance requirements.
The performance requirements and operational standards for electronic data filing are detailed in Customs Publication 552, Customs And Trade Automated Interface Requirements (CATAIR), which is updated periodically. The User Support Services Division, Customs Headquarters, upon request, shall provide each prospective participant with a copy of this publication. Each prospective participant must demonstrate that his system can interface directly with the Customs computer and ensure accurate submission of required data. Such demonstration will include intensive testing of the participant's system and monitoring of its performance in accordance with Publication 552.
§ 143.6
Failure to maintain performance standards.
ABI participants must adhere to the performance requirements and operational standards of the ABI system and maintain a high level of quality in the transmission of data, as defined in Customs Publication 552 (CATAIR) and Customs directives and policy statements, in order to participate in ABI.
(a)
Probational status.
A participant who does not adhere to the requirements and standards of the ABI system or maintain a high level of quality as described above may be placed on probational status. The participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the Director, User Support Services Division, of any action to place the participant on probation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds for the proposed probation, and advise the participant that he will have 15 days from the date of the notice to show cause why the probationary period should not take effect. If the participant fails to respond within the allotted time, or fails to show to the satisfaction of the Director, User Support Services Division, that the probationary period should not take effect, the Director will notify the participant of the effective date of the probationary period. The length of the probationary period may, in the discretion of the Director, User Support Services Division, be extended up to a maximum of 90 days, if the participant's performance remains below standard, but, except for immediate revocation under § 143.7, participation will not be suspended or revoked until the probationary period has lasted a minimum of 30 days. The participant's performance will be closely monitored during this time, which will include working with the participant and providing any necessary guidance to assist the participant in bringing his performance back to standard.
(b)
Suspension following probationary period.
If deficiencies are not corrected within the probationary period, the participant will be suspended from operational status. The participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the Director, User Support Services Division, of any action to suspend participation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds and effective date for the suspension, and the right to appeal the suspension to the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of suspension (see § 143.8).
(c)
Reinstatement following suspension.
To obtain reinstatement to operational status, a suspended participant must submit a letter to the Director, User Support Services Division, stating that the deficiencies for which the suspension was invoked have been corrected.
If, after the participant has demonstrated compliance with the system performance requirements and operational standards specified in § 143.5 of this part, if required, the Director is satisfied that the deficiencies have been corrected, the participant will be reinstated.
§ 143.7
Revocation of ABI participation.
(a)
Fraud or misstatement of material fact.
If it is determined at any time that participation in the system was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact, the Executive Director, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, will immediately revoke ABI participation.
(b)
Risk of significant harm to system.
If the participant's continued use of ABI would pose a potential risk of significant harm to the integrity and functioning of the system, the Director, User Support Services Division, will immediately revoke ABI participation.
(c)
Notification to participant.
The participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the applicable Director, of the revocation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds and effective date of revocation, and the right to appeal the revocation to the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of revocation.
§ 143.8
Appeal of suspension or revocation.
If the participant files a written appeal with the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of action to suspend or revoke participation as provided in §§ 143.6 and 143.7, the suspension or revocation of participation shall not take effect until the appeal is decided, except in those cases where the Executive Director, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, or the Director, User Support Services Division, respectively, determines that participation was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact, or that continued participation would pose a potential risk of significant harm to the integrity and functioning of the system. The CBP officer who receives the appeal shall stamp the date of receipt of the appeal and the stamped date is the date of receipt for purposes of the appeal. The Assistant Commissioner shall inform the participant of the date of receipt and the date that a response is due under this paragraph. The Assistant Commissioner shall render his decision to the participant, in writing, stating his reasons therefor, by letter mailed within 30 working days following receipt of the appeal, unless this period is extended with due notification to the participant.

This subpart sets forth the general requirements and procedures for Remote Location Filing (RLF). RLF entries are subject to the documentation, document retention and document retrieval requirements of this chapter as well as the general entry requirements of parts 141, 142 and 143 of this chapter. Participation in the RLF program is voluntary and at the option of the filer.
§ 143.42
Definitions.
The following definitions, in addition to the definitions set forth in § 143.32 of this part, apply for purposes of this subpart E:
(a)
Remote Location Filing (RLF)
—“RLF” is an elective method of making entry by which a customs broker with a national permit electronically transmits all data information associated with an entry that CBP can process in a completely electronic data interchange system to a RLF-operational CBP location from a remote location other than where the goods are being entered. (Importers filing on
their own behalf may file electronically in any port, subject to ABI filing requirements.)
(b)
RLF-operational CBP location
—“RLF-operational CBP location” means a CBP location within the customs territory of the United States that is staffed with CBP personnel who have been trained in RLF procedures and who have operational experience with the Electronic Invoice Program (EIP). EIP is defined in § 143.32 of this chapter. A list of all RLF-operational locations is available for viewing on the CBP Internet Web site located at
http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/trade_programs/remote_location_filing/.
§ 143.43
RLF eligibility criteria.
(a)
Automation criteria.
To be eligible for RLF, a licensed customs broker or importer of record must be:
(1) Operational on the ABI (
see
19 CFR part 143, subpart A);
(2) Operational on the EIP prior to applying for RLF; and
(3) Operational on the ACH (or any other CBP-approved method of electronic payment), for purposes of directing the electronic payment of duties, taxes and fees (
see
19 CFR 24.25), 30 days before transmitting a RLF entry.
(b)
Broker must have national permit.
To be eligible for RLF, a licensed customs broker must hold a valid national permit (
see
19 CFR 111.19(f)).
(c)
Continuous bond.
A RLF entry must be secured with a continuous bond.
§ 143.44
RLF procedure.
(a)
Electronic transmission of invoice data.
For RLF transactions, a customs broker or importer of record must transmit electronically, using EIP, any invoice data required by CBP.
(b)
Electronic transmission of payment.
For RLF transactions, a customs broker or importer of record must direct the electronic payment of duties, taxes and fees through the ACH (
see
19 CFR 24.25) or any other method of electronic payment authorized by CBP.
(c)
Automation requirements.
Only those entries and entry summaries that CBP processes completely in an electronic data interchange system will be accepted for RLF. For a listing of entry types that may be filed via RLF, go to
http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/trade_programs/remote_location_filing/.
(d)
Combined electronic entry and entry summary.
For RLF transactions using a combined electronic entry and entry summary, a customs broker must submit to CBP, through ABI or any other electronic interface authorized by CBP, a complete and error-free electronic data transmission constituting the entry summary that serves as both the entry and entry summary.
(e)
No line release or immediate delivery entries permitted under RLF.
Line release (
see
19 CFR, Part 142, Subpart D) or immediate delivery procedures may not be combined with RLF transactions.
(f)
Data acceptance and release of merchandise.
Data that are complete and error free will be accepted by CBP. If electronic invoice or additional electronic documentation is required, CBP will so notify the RLF filer. If no documentation is required to be filed, CBP will so notify the RLF filer. If CBP accepts the RLF entry (including invoice data) under §§ 143.34 through 143.36 of this part, the RLF entry will be deemed to satisfy all filing requirements under this part and the merchandise may be released.
(g)
Liquidation.
The entry summary will be scheduled for liquidation once payment is made under statement processing (
see
19 CFR 24.25).
§ 143.45
Filing of additional entry information.
When filing from a remote location, a RLF filer must electronically file all additional information required by CBP to be presented with the entry and entry summary information (including facsimile transmissions) that CBP can accept electronically. If CBP cannot accept additional information electronically, the RLF filer must file the additional information in a paper format at the CBP port of entry where the goods arrived.

(a)
Form.
A withdrawal for either direct or indirect exportation must be filed by submitting an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter or on CBP Form 7501 in 3 copies for merchandise being exported under cover of a TIR carnet. The in-bond application or CBP Form 7501 must contain all of the statistical information as provided in § 141.61(e) of this chapter. The port director may require an extra copy or copies of CBP Form 7501 for use in connection with the delivery of merchandise to the carrier.
(b)
Procedure for indirect exportation
—(1)
Forwarding.
Merchandise withdrawn for indirect exportation (transportation and exportation) must be forwarded to the port of exportation in accordance with the general provisions for transportation in bond (part 18 of this chapter).
(2)
Dividing of shipments.
The dividing up for exportation of shipments arriving under warehouse withdrawals for indirect exportation will be permitted only when various portions of a shipment are destined to different destinations, when the export vessel cannot properly accommodate the entire quantity, or in other similar circumstances. In the case of merchandise moving under cover of a TIR carnet, if the merchandise is not to be exported or if the shipment is to be divided, appropriate entry will be required and the carnet discharged. The provisions of §§ 18.23 and 18.24 of this chapter concerning change of destination or retention of merchandise on the dock must also be followed in applicable cases.
(c)
Exportation by mail.
Merchandise may be withdrawn from warehouse for exportation by mail in accordance with the provisions of subpart F of part 145 of this chapter.
(d)
Marks on packages.
The exportation must be made under the original marks of importation. Port marks may be added by authority of the port director under CBP supervision. The original and port marks must appear in all CBP papers pertaining to the exportation.
(e)
Weight, gauge, or measure.
Merchandise in bulk and packaged articles which are customarily bought and sold by weight, gauge, or measure may be withdrawn for exportation or transportation only at the actual quantities ascertained at the time of the original entry for warehouse, except as otherwise provided for by law. In any case, the port director may require a special report of weight, gauge, or measure of the merchandise being exported if he deems it necessary.
(f)
Merchandise not laden.
Merchandise withdrawn for exportation but not laden must be sent to general order unless other disposition is prescribed by the port director.
(g)
Exportation at a foreign trade zone.
Merchandise may be withdrawn for exportation at a foreign trade zone in the same or at a different port. The merchandise will be considered exported upon admission to a zone in zone-restricted status, as provided in § 146.44(c) of this chapter.
(h)
Class 9 warehouse withdrawals for exportation
—(1)
Applicability of sales ticket procedure.
Merchandise in a Class 9 warehouse (duty-free store) may be withdrawn for any of the purposes set forth in this subpart. However, only conditionally duty-free merchandise in a Class 9 warehouse intended for exportation or for delivery to persons and organizations set forth in subpart I, part 148, of this chapter, will be eligible for withdrawal under the sales ticket procedure specified in this paragraph.
(2)
Sales ticket content and handling.
Sales ticket withdrawals must be made only under a blanket permit to withdrawal (see § 19.6(d) of this chapter) and the sales ticket will serve as the equivalent of the supplementary withdrawal. A sales ticket is an invoice of the proprietor's design which will include:
(i) Serial number and date of preparation of each ticket;
(ii) Warehouse entry number or specific identifier, if approved by the port director;
(iii) Quantity of goods sold;
(iv) Brief description of the articles including the size of bottles;
(v) The full name and address of the purchaser. However, the port director may waive the address requirement for all merchandise except for alcoholic beverages in quantities in excess of 4 liters and cigarettes in quantities in excess of 3 cartons. Also, the address requirement is not applicable with respect to purchasers at airport duty-free enterprises; and
(vi) A statement on the original copy (purchaser's copy) to the effect that goods purchased in a duty-free store will be subject to duty and/or tax with personal exemption if returned to the United States. At the time of purchase, the original sales ticket must be made out in the name of the purchaser and given to the purchaser. One copy of the sales ticket must be retained by the proprietor. This copy may be maintained electronically. A permit file copy will be attached to the parcel containing the purchased articles unless the proprietor has established and maintained an effective method to match the parcel containing the purchased articles with the purchaser. Additional copies may be retained by the proprietor.
(3)
Sales ticket register.
In addition to the records required in § 19.12(a) of this chapter, Class 9 warehouse proprietors must maintain a sales ticket register or similar accounting record for each warehouse entry. The sales ticket register of the proprietor must include the following information:
(i) Warehouse entry number;
(ii) Specific identifier, if applicable;
(iii) Sales ticket date and number;
(iv) Description;
(v) Quantity; and
(vi) Current balance.
As each warehouse entry is closed out, the warehouse proprietor must verify the sales ticket register total with the amount withdrawn so as to account for all merchandise so withdrawn and certify on the register that all the goods have been exported or sold to qualifying persons and organizations under part 148 of this chapter. The sales ticket register must be included in the permit file folder with or in lieu of the blanket permit summary, as provided in § 19.6(d)(5) of this chapter. A copy of all sales tickets must be retained by the proprietor for not less than 5 years after the date of the last sales ticket in the entry. In lieu of placing a copy of sales tickets in each permit file folder, the warehouse proprietor may keep all sales tickets in a readily retrievable manner in a separate file.

# Subpart C—Administrative Review of Mail Entries
§ 145.21
Administrative review.
Requests for adjustment of the amount of duty assessed under mail entries shall be handled as requests for administrative review in accordance with this subpart.
§ 145.22
Procedures for obtaining administrative review.
If an addressee is dissatisfied with the amount of duty assessed under a mail entry made before December 18, 2004, he may obtain administrative review in the following ways:
(a) He may pay the assessed duty, take delivery of the merchandise, and send a copy of the mail entry to the issuing CBP office indicated on the mail entry, together with a statement of the reason it is believed the duty assessed is incorrect. Any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence should be submitted with the statement. The addressee may show the mail entry number and date on his statement instead of sending a copy of the mail entry, but this may result in delay.
(b) He may postpone acceptance of the shipment, and within the time allowed by the Postal regulations provide the postmaster with a written statement of his objections. The postmaster will forward the mail entry together with the addressee's statement and any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence submitted by the addressee to the port director who issued the entry, and retain custody of the shipment until advice is received from the port director as to the disposition to be made. If the addressee is located near one of the ports at which CBP officers are authorized to review mail entries (see 39 CFR 10.5), the postmaster may send the mail entry to that port, together with the addressee's statement and evidence, for reconsideration by the port director.
(c) He may pay the assessed duty and take delivery of the merchandise, and file a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), in the form and manner prescribed in part 174 of this chapter. For mail entries made before December 18, 2004, a protest must be filed no later than 90 days after payment of the duties by the addressee. All other mail entries must be protested within 180 days after payment of the duties by the addressee.

§ 145.23
Time limits.
A mail entry made before December 18, 2004 may be amended under section 520(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)), only if the addressee requests such amendment within the time limits prescribed therein (see §§ 173.4 and 173.5 of this chapter), and the claim is allowable under section 520(c). Requests for adjustment in the amount of duty assessed under mail entries made under § 145.22(a) must be made in such time that the request can be acted upon by the port director within 90 days after receipt of the mail article and payment of the duties by the addressee. For a mail entry made before December 18, 2004, protests under § 145.22(c) of this chapter must be filed no later than 90 days after payment of the duties by the addressee, but may be acted upon by CBP after expiration of that 90-day period.

§ 145.24
Amendment of entry.
If the port director is satisfied that the objection is valid and timely, he shall amend the mail entry. If the duty has already been paid, Customs shall issue an appropriate refund of duty.
§ 145.25
Entry correct.
If the port director believes the duty originally assessed was correct, he shall send the addressee a notice in writing that the request for refund of duty has been denied. If the duty has not been paid, the mail entry shall be returned to the postmaster concerned, together with a copy of the notice sent to the addressee. The postmaster will then collect the duty and deliver the shipment, or, if the addressee refuses to pay the duty, will treat the shipment as undeliverable.
§ 145.26
Rates of duty not binding.
Rates of duty assessed on a mail entry, whether assessed on the original entry or as amendments under § 145.24, are not binding for future importations. A binding ruling on tariff classification may be obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 177 of this chapter.

# Policy Statement to Part 145—Examination of Sealed Letter Class Mail
A. Customs officers and employees shall not open first class mail arriving in the U.S. Virgin Islands for delivery there, if it originated in the Customs territory of the United States, unless a search warrant or written authorization of the sender or addressee is obtained. Customs officers or employees may open and examine all other sealed letter class mail which is subject to the Customs mail regulations (see 19 CFR part 145) and which appears to contain matter in addition to, or other than, correspondence, provided they have “reasonable cause to suspect” the presence of merchandise or contraband.
B. Customs officers and employees shall not open any sealed letter class mail which appears to contain only correspondence unless a search warrant or written authorization of the sender or addressee is obtained in advance of the opening.
C. Customs officers and employees are prohibited from reading, or authorizing or allowing others to read, any correspondence contained in any letter class mail unless there has been obtained in advance either a search warrant or written authorization of the sender or addressee. This prohibition, which will continue to be strictly enforced, also applies to correspondence between school children and correspondence of the blind which are authorized to be mailed at other than the letter rate of postage in international mail.
D. If a violation of law is discovered upon opening any mail article referred to in paragraph C, and it is believed that the correspondence may provide additional information concerning the violation and is therefore needed for further investigation or use in court, a search warrant shall be obtained before any correspondence is seized, read, or referred to another agency. Search warrants shall be promptly sought. Correspondence may be detained while a search warrant is being sought.
E. If no controlled delivery is arranged and correspondence is not to be otherwise seized pursuant to a search warrant (see “F” below), the item which constitutes the violation shall be removed and any correspondence shall be replaced in the wrapper, or in a new wrapper if the original wrapper has been seized pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a. The wrapper shall then be resealed, marked to indicate it was opened by Customs, and returned to postal channels. Appropriate seizure notices shall be sent in accordance with 19 CFR 145.59(b).
F. No mail article may be referred to another agency without a search warrant unless—
(1) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article is being referred for examination and clearance under 19 CFR 145.57,
(2) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article has been lawfully seized by Customs,
(3) The mail article is being referred to Postal Service channels to effect a controlled delivery in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, or
(4) The mail article is being returned to Postal Service channels for normal processing.
G. Whenever sealed letter class mail is opened, the factors giving the Customs officer or employee “reasonable cause to suspect” the presence of merchandise or contraband shall be recorded on the appropriate form and on the opened envelope or other container by means of appropriate coded symbols. Should a seizure result, these factors shall also be recorded on the seizure report.
H. Sealed letter class mail with the green Customs label on a Customs declaration may be opened without additional cause. Correspondence in such mail is subject to the restrictions regarding the detention, reading, and referral of mail to other agencies found in paragraphs C through F.
I. Whenever any sealed letter class mail is opened for any of the reasons set forth in the above paragraphs, a Postal Service employee shall be present and shall observe the opening.
J. Any violation of the Customs mail regulations or any of these policies will lead to appropriate administrative sanctions, as well as possible criminal prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1702.
[T.D. 73-135, 38 FR 13369, May 21, 1973, as amended by T.D. 84-213, 49 FR 41185, Oct. 19, 1984]
Pt. 145, App.

# Appendix to Part 145
A.
Scope.
The Customs Service is authorized to examine, with certain exceptions for diplomatic and governmental mail, all mail arriving from outside the Customs territory of the United States (CTUS) which is to be delivered within the CTUS, and all mail arriving from outside the U.S. Virgin Islands which is to be delivered within the U.S. Virgin Islands. The term “Customs territory of the United States” is limited to the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Consequently, mail arriving from other U.S. territories and possessions is subject to Customs examination even though it is designated “domestic” mail for Postal Service purposes. Likewise, mail in the APO/FPO military postal system is subject to Customs examination, even though it also is designated “domestic” mail for Postal Service purposes. The Customs Service therefor is responsible for examining all international mail to be delivered in the CTUS and certain limited categories of so-called “domestic mail”.
B.
Definitions.
Under various international conventions and bilateral agreements, international mail falls within two main classes, Parcel Post and Postal Union mail.
Parcel Post is not permitted to contain correspondence but is to be used for the transmission of merchandise and is fully subject to Customs examination in the same manner as other merchandise shipments (e.g., luggage, cargo, containers, etc.). Postal Union mail is divided into “LC” mail (Lettres et Cartes) and “AO” mail (Aures Objets).
“LC mail consists of letters, packages paid at the letter rate of postage, post cards, and aerogrammes. The term “letter class mail” as used in the Customs Regulations and in this policy statement means “LC” mail as well as equivalent articles in “domestic” mail subject to Customs examination. Equivalent articles in “domestic” mail would include articles mailed at the letter rate, or equivalent class or category, in the APO/FPO military system or from a U.S. territory or possession outside the CTUS. Since the term “letter class mail” thus includes packages and bulky envelopes as long as they are mailed at the letter rate, or equivalent class or category, the restrictions relating to opening and reading of correspondence apply equally to such packages or bulky envelopes.
“AO” mail is to be treated in the same manner as Parcel Post mail since the Universal Postal Union Convention requires
that they “be made up in such a manner that they may be easily examined” and generally are not permitted to “contain any document having the character of current and personal correspondence.” Exceptions to the latter requirement exist for matter for the blind and certain correspondence between school children. Because of these exceptions, the prohibition against reading correspondence without a search warrant or authorization of the sender or addressee applies to correspondence of the blind and correspondence between school children contained in “AO” mail. “AO” mail can usually be identified by the following words: “Imprime” or “Printed Matter”, “Cecogramme” or “Literature for the Blind”, “Petit Paquet” or “Small Packet” or similar terms or their equivalents.
C.
Reasonable Cause to Suspect.
Determining whether there is “reasonable cause to suspect” that merchandise or contraband is contained in sealed letter class mail is ultimately a matter of judgment for each Customs official, based on all relevant facts and circumstances. This judgment should be exercised within the framework of the Customs regulation that sealed letter class mail which appears to contain only correspondence is not to be opened unless a search warrant or written authorization from either the sender or the addressee has been obtained in advance of the opening.
Past practice indicates that the following circumstances (which are illustrative and not exhaustive) provide “reasonable cause to suspect” and permit the opening of sealed letter class mail without a search warrant or authorization of the sender or addressee.
1. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or explosives in a specific mail article.
2. X-ray of fluoroscope examination indicates the presence of merchandise or contraband.
3. The weight, shape, feel, or sound of the mail article or its contents may indicate that merchandise or contraband (e.g., a hard object which may be jewelry, a stack of paper which may be counterfeit money, or coins) could be in the mail article. Contents of a mail article which feel lumpy, powdery, or spongy may, for example, indicate the presence of narcotics.
4. Information from a source previously shown to be reliable indicates that an identifiable mail article contains merchandise or contraband.
5. The mail article is insured.
6. The mail article is a box, carton, or wrapper other than a thin envelope.
7. The sender or addressee of the mail article is known to be fictitious.
On the other hand, certain facts standing alone generally will not provide “reasonable cause to suspect” the presence of merchandise or contraband and therefore do not permit the opening of sealed letter class mail. For example, sealed letter class mail may not be opened merely because:
1. The mail article is registered.
2. The feel of a letter-size envelope suggests that it contains one or a limited number of photographs.
3. The mail article appears to be part of a mass mailing.
4. The mail article is from a particular country, whether or not a known source country of contraband.
5. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or explosives somewhere within a tray of mail (the individual articles of mail must then be examined individually).
6. The sender of addressee of the mail article is known to have mailed or received contraband or merchandise in violation of law in the past.
7. The wrapper contains writing or typing similar to that previously found on articles of mail which contained contraband or merchandise in violation of law.
In case where any one of the above facts is present, additional evidence must exist which in conjunction with that fact provides reasonable cause to suspect the presence of merchandise or contraband.

§ 146.0
Scope.
Foreign trade zones are established under the Foreign Trade Zones Act and the general regulations and rules of procedure of the Foreign Trade Zones Board contained in 15 CFR part 400. This part 146 of the Customs Regulations governs the admission of merchandise into a foreign trade zone, manipulation, manufacture, or exhibition in a zone; exportation of the merchandise from a zone; and transfer of merchandise from a zone into Customs territory.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 146.1
Definitions.
(a) The following words, defined in section 1 of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a), are given the same meaning when used in this part, unless otherwise stated: “Board”, “Grantee”, and “Zones”.
(b) The following are general definitions for the purpose of this part:
Act.
“Act” means the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (48 Stat. 998-1003; 19 U.S.C. 81a-u).
Activation.
“Activation” means approval by the grantee and port director for operations and for the admission and handling of merchandise in zone status.
Admit.
“Admit” means to bring merchandise into a zone with zone status.
Alteration.
“Alteration” means a change in the boundaries of an activated zone or subzone; activation of a
separate site of an already-activated zone or subzone with the same operator at the same port; or the relocation of an already-activated site with the same operator.
Conditionally admissible merchandise.
“Conditionally admissible merchandise” is merchandise which may be imported into the U.S. under certain conditions. Merchandise which is subject to permits or licenses, or which may be reconditioned to bring it into compliance with the laws administered by various Federal agencies, is an example of conditionally admissible merchandise.
Constructive transfer.
“Constructive transfer” is a legal fiction which permits acceptance of a Customs entry for merchandise in a zone before its physical transfer to the Customs territory.
Customs territory.
“Customs territory” is the territory of the U.S. in which the general tariff laws of the U.S. apply. “Customs territory of the United States” includes only the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. (General Note 2, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)).
Deactivation.
“Deactivation” means voluntary discontinuation of the activation of an entire zone or subzone by the grantee or operator. Discontinuance of the activated status of only a part of a zone site is an alteration.
Default.
“Default” means an action or omission that will result in a claim for duties, taxes, charges, or liquidated damages under the Foreign Trade Zone Operator Bond.
Domestic merchandise.
“Domestic merchandise” is merchandise which has been (i) produced in the U.S. and not exported therefrom, or (ii) previously imported into Customs territory and properly released from Customs custody.
Foreign merchandise.
“Foreign merchandise” is imported merchandise which has not been properly released from Customs custody in Customs territory.
Fungible merchandise.

In that case, the operator shall supervise the receipt of merchandise into the zone, report the receipt and condition of the merchandise, and mark packages with the unique Customs Form 214 number so that the merchandise can be traced to a particular Customs Form 214. Packages that are accounted for under a Customs-authorized inventory method other than specific identification, need not be marked with a unique Customs Form 214 number but must be adequately identified so Customs can conduct an inventory count. The operator shall submit the Custom Form 214 to Customs at the location specified by the port director.

Arrival of conveyance.
Upon arrival at a subzone or zone site of a conveyance containing foreign merchandise, the operator shall:

(2) Check the condition of any seal affixed to the conveyance, and if broken, missing or improperly affixed, notify the port director and receive instructions before unloading the merchandise;
(3) Check each incoming in-bond and cartage shipment to determine if the manifested quantity or the quantity on the cartage document agrees with the quantity actually received;
(4) Sign and date the in-bond or cartage documentation to accept responsibility for the merchandise under the Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond and to relieve the carrier of responsibility.
(5) Forward the in-bond or cartage documentation so as to reach the port director within 2 working days after the date of arrival of the conveyance at the subzone or zone site;
(6) Maintain a file of open in-bond manifests in chronological order of date of conveyance arrival to identify shipments that have arrived but the entire contents of which have not been admitted to the subzone or zone site; and
(7) Notify the port director, by annotation on the Customs Form 214, when the entire contents of a shipment have been admitted.
(b)
Transportation by operator.
If merchandise is transported to a subzone or zone site by the foreign trade zone operator from a location in the district (see definition of “district” at § 112.1) in which the subzone or zone site is situated, the merchandise is deemed admitted at the time the foreign trade zone operator picks it up. At the time of pick-up, the operator is responsible for:
(1) Receipting for the merchandise and recording on the appropriate document any discrepancies regarding quantity, condition or the status of the seals;
(2) Transporting the merchandise to the zone or subzone; and
(3) Ensuring that the zone records reflect that the merchandise is received in the zone.

The forms shall be submitted within 10 days after the end of the month in which the merchandise was received in the zone, and no extension beyond that time will be approved by the port director.
(3)
General order.
Merchandise not admitted into a subzone or zone site as provided in this section within 15 calendar days after its arrival there shall be disposed of in accordance with the applicable procedures in § 4.37 or § 122.50 or § 123.10 of this chapter.
(4)
Inventory control and recordkeeping system.
The operator shall establish and maintain a continuing input quality control program to ensure that information concerning merchandise in admission documents, verified or corrected by counts and checks, is accurately recorded in the inventory control and recordkeeping system. Quantities recorded in the system, after allowance by the port director for any discrepancies, will be the quantities of merchandise for which the operator shall be held liable under its bond for admission to the subzone or zone site. A discrepancy involving a within-case shortage (or overage) need not be reported on Customs Form 5931, if the operator is able to report that information in another manner so that the port director can determine whether there is liability for the discrepancy under the bond of any party to the importation.

§ 146.66
Transfer of merchandise from one zone to another.
(a)
At the same port.
A transfer of merchandise to another zone with a different operator at the same port (including a consolidated port) must be made by a licensed cartman or a bonded carrier as provided for in § 112.2(b) of this chapter or by the operator of the zone for which the merchandise is destined under an entry for immediate transportation filed via an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter or other appropriate form with a CBP Form 214 filed at the destination zone. A transfer of merchandise between zone sites at the same port having the same operator may be made under a permit on CBP Form 6043 or under a local control system approved by the port director wherein any loss of merchandise between sites will be treated as if the loss occurred in the zone.
(b)
At a different port.
A transfer of merchandise from a zone at one port of entry to a zone at another port must be made by bonded carrier under an entry for immediate transportation filed via an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter. All copies of the entry must bear a notation that the merchandise is being transferred to another zone designated by its number.
(c)
Forwarding of merchandise history; documentation.
When merchandise is transferred under the provisions of this section, the operator of the transferring zone shall provide the operator of the destination zone with the documented history of the merchandise being transferred.

§ 146.70
Transfer of zone-restricted merchandise into Customs territory.
(a)
General.
Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred to Customs territory only for entry for exportation, for entry for transportation and exportation, for warehousing pending exportation, for destruction (except destruction of distilled spirits, wines and fermented malt liquors), for transfer from one zone to another, or for delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft or as ground equipment of a qualified aircraft under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317), unless the Board has ruled that the return of the merchandise to Customs territory for domestic consumption is in the public interest. With Board approval (See 15 CFR part 400), that merchandise may be entered for consumption, for warehousing, for immediate transportation without appraisement, or under any other provision of the Customs laws, unless the Board has specified the form of entry to be made.
(b)
For consumption.
If the return of zone-restricted merchandise to Customs territory for consumption has been ruled by the Board to be in the public interest, the entry shall be endorsed by the port director to show the authority under which it was made, and that the merchandise is subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter I, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
(c)
For warehousing.
Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse for storage pending exportation. The Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption. In the case of zone-restricted merchandise transported in bond to another port for warehousing and exportation, Customs Form 7512 shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise is foreign trade zone merchandise in zone-restricted status, which shall be entered for warehouse with proper endorsement on Customs Form 7501, and which may not be withdrawn for consumption. Zone-restricted merchandise transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse may not be manipulated, except for packing or unpacking incidental to exportation.
(d)
For other purposes.
Upon acceptance of an entry or withdrawal for zone-restricted merchandise for any purpose other than that described in a Board order, the entry shall be endorsed by the person making entry to show that actual exportation of the merchandise is required by the fourth proviso to section 3 of the Act, as amended, or the entry endorsed to require delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft, under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317).
[T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51263, Dec. 21, 1988; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61291, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 146.71
Release and removal of merchandise from zone.
(a)
General.
Except as provided for in § 146.43, no merchandise will be transferred from a zone without a Customs permit on the appropriate entry or withdrawal form or other document as required in this part. This port director may authorize transfer from a zone without physical supervision or examination by a Customs officer. Upon issuance of a permit, the port director will authorize delivery of the merchandise only to the operator, who then may release the merchandise to the importer or carrier.
(b)
Liability for discrepancy.
When a transfer is not physically supervised by a Customs officer, the operator will be relieved of responsibility only for the
merchandise in a zone in the condition and quantity as shown on the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form. The operator will be relieved of responsibility only if it receives the signed receipt on the document of the importer or the carrier named in that document. The responsibility of the operator may be adjusted by any discrepancy report made jointly by the operator and the bonded cartman, lighterman, or carrier, or the importer, and signed by the above or an authorized representative within 15 days after transfer of the merchandise from the zone. Any adjustment must be noted on the permit copy of the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form or document. A copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be submitted to the port director within 10 working days of signing by the parties.
(c)
Time limit.
Except in the case of articles for use in a zone, merchandise for which a Customs permit for transfer to Customs territory has been issued must be physically removed from the zone within 5 working days of issuance of that permit. The port director, upon request of the operator, may extend that period for good cause. Merchandise awaiting removal within the required time limit will not be further manipulated or manufactured in the zone, but will be segregated or otherwise identified by the operator as merchandise that has been constructively transferred to Customs territory.
(d)
Retention or return of merchandise to zone for consumption.
(1) The port director shall cancel any entry for consumption where: (i) The merchandise is not removed from the zone within the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or (ii) the merchandise was removed from the zone but did not enter the commerce of the U.S. in Customs territory and was subsequently readmitted to a zone in domestic status. If the port director has reason to believe any new entry would be cancelled under the provisions of this paragraph, he may reject the entry or demand a written stipulation, as a condition of entry acceptance, that the merchandise will not be returned to a zone in domestic status. Merchandise covered by an entry which has been cancelled under this paragraph shall be restored to its last foreign status.
(2) A component of merchandise which has been entered, but not physically removed from a zone, shall be restored to its last zone status, provided the port director determines that the component was included in the entry through clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence not amounting to an error in the construction of the law. Such an error, including that in appraisement of any entry or liquidation due to the above circumstances, may be corrected pursuant to section 520(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), in accordance with the procedures described in part 173 of this chapter. If the port director decides there has been no error, mistake, or inadvertence, or that the information was not timely provided, the component will be considered as an overage and subject to the provisions of § 146.53(d).
(3) When merchandise which has been entered for consumption is subsequently returned to a zone for a reason other than that specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it shall be admitted in domestic status.

§ 146.81
Penalties.
(a)
Amount.
Upon violation of the Act, or any regulation issued under the Act, by the grantee, or any officer, agent, operator or employee thereof, the person responsible for or permitting the violation shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000. Each day during which a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Liquidated damages, where applicable, will be imposed in addition to the fine (19 U.S.C. 81s).
(b)
Review.
All fines assessed by the port director under this section will be reviewed by the Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, or his designee, Headquarters, to determine whether further action against
the grantee or operator, such as suspension or a recommendation for revocation of the grant, is warranted.
[T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46115, Sept. 10, 1991]
§ 146.82
Suspension.
(a)
For cause.
The port director may suspend for cause the activated status of a zone or zone site, or the privilege to admit, manufacture, manipulate, exhibit, destroy, transfer or remove merchandise at a zone or zone site for a period not to exceed 90 days. Upon order of the Board the suspension may be continued. If appropriate, the suspension may be limited to an individual user or users and not to the zone or zone site as a whole, or may be limited to a particular activity of an operator or user, such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise or the privilege to manufacture. An action to suspend will be taken in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) The approval of the application to activate the zone was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;
(2) The operator neglects or refuses to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relating to the operation or administration of a zone;
(3) The operator, or any officer of a corporation which has been granted the right to operate a zone, is convicted of or has commited acts which would constitute a felony, or misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;
(4) The operator fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses, or other information as required by § 146.7;
(5) The operator does not provide a secure facility or properly safeguard merchandise within a zone;
(6) [Reserved]
(7) The operator, or any officer, agent, or employee of the operator, discloses to an unauthorized person proprietary information contained on a Customs form or in the inventory control and recordkeeping system; or
(8) The inventory control and recordkeeping system is impaired to the point where the identity of merchandise in zone status has been lost and cannot be reestablished without a suspension of zone operations.
(b)
Procedure
—(1)
Notice.
The port director may, at any time, serve notice, in writing, upon an operator to show cause why its right to continue operation of a zone should not be suspended or why an individual user or activities of an individual user should not be suspended, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. The notice will advise the operator of the grounds for the proposed action and will afford the operator an opportunity to respond, in writing, within 15 days after receipt of the notice. Thereafter, the port director shall consider the allegations and any response made by the operator and issue a decision, unless the operator requests a hearing in the matter.
(2)
Hearing.
If the operator requests a hearing, it will be held before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Customs or his designee within 30 days following the operator's request. The operator may be represented by counsel at the hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding, including substantiation of the allegations and the response thereto, will be presented. The right of cross-examination will be available to both parties. A stenographic record of the proceeding will be made and a copy will be delivered to the operator. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly all papers and the stenographic record of the hearing to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, together with a recommendation for final action.
(3)
Decision of Assistant Commissioner.
Within 10 calendar days after delivery to the operator of a copy of the stenographic record of the hearing, the operator may submit to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, in writing any additional
views or arguments. The Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, shall then render a written decision stating his reasons therefor. That decision will be served on the operator and will be considered the final Customs administrative action in the case.
(4)
Grantee.
If the grantee of the zone is not the operator, a copy of the notice to show cause will be served upon the grantee. The grantee, as a party-in-interest, may join the operator in any proceedings under this section.
[T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, as amended by T.D. 88-63, 53 FR 40220, Oct. 14, 1988; T.D. 95-99, 60 FR 62733, Dec. 7, 1995]
§ 146.83
Revocation of zone grant.
(a)
Recommendation of port director.
The port director may at any time recommend to the Board that the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a zone or subzone under CBP jurisdiction be revoked for willful and repeated violations of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81r). If the port director believes that a substantial question of law exists as to whether willful and repeated violations of the Act have occurred, that officer may request internal advice under the provisions of part 177 of this chapter from the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters. A recommendation to the Board that a zone or subzone grant be revoked does not preclude, and may be in addition to, any liquidated damages, penalty, or suspension for cause.
(b)
Decision of the Board.
The procedure for revocation of a grant, the decision of the Board, and appeal is covered by the provisions of the Act and title 15, chapter IV, part 400, Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart H—Petroleum Refineries in Foreign-Trade Subzones

# Source:
T.D. 95-35, 60 FR 20632, Apr. 27, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 146.91
Applicability.
This subpart applies only to a petroleum refinery (as defined herein) engaged in refining petroleum in a foreign-trade zone or subzone. Further, the provisions relating to zones generally, which are set forth elsewhere in this part, including documentation and document retention requirements, and entry procedures, such as weekly entry, shall apply as well to a refinery subzone, insofar as applicable to and not inconsistent with the specific provisions of this subpart. It does not cover zone-to-zone transfers in which the fact of removal from one zone is ignored.
§ 146.92
Definitions.
(a)
Attribution.
“Attribution” means the association of a final product with its source material.
(b)
Feedstocks.
“Feedstocks” means crude petroleum or intermediate product that is used in a petroleum refinery to make a final product.
(c)
Feedstock factor.
“Feedstock factor” means the relative value of final products utilizing T.D. 66-16 (see § 146.92(h)), and which takes into account any volumetric loss or gain.
(d)
Final product.
“Final product” means any petroleum product that is produced in a refinery subzone and thereafter removed therefrom or consumed within the zone.
(e)
Manufacturing period.
“Manufacturing period” means a period selected by the refiner which must be no more than a calendar month basis, for which attribution to a source feedstock must be made for every final product made, consumed in, or removed from the refinery subzone.
(f)
Petroleum refinery.
“Petroleum refinery” means a facility that refines a feedstock listed on the top line of the tables set forth in T.D. 66-16 into a product listed in the left column of the tables set forth in T.D. 66-16.
(g)
Price of product.
“Price of product” means the average per unit market value of each final product for a given manufacturing period or the published standard product value if updated each month.
(h)
Producibility.
“Producibility” is a method of attributing products to feedstocks for petroleum manufacturing in
accordance with the Industry Standards of Potential Production set forth in T.D. 66-16.
(i)
Relative value.
“Relative value” means a value assigned to each final product attributed to the separation from a privileged foreign feedstock based on the ratio of the final product's value compared to the privileged foreign feedstock's duty.
(j)
Time of separation.
“Time of separation” means the manufacturing period in which a privileged foreign status feedstock is deemed to have been separated into two or more final products.
(k)
Weighted average.
“Weighted average” means the relative value of merchandise, which is determined by dividing the total value of shipments in a given period by the total quantity shipped in the same given period. See example in section VI of the appendix to this part.
§ 146.93
Inventory control and recordkeeping system.
(a)
Attribution.
All final products removed from or consumed within a petroleum refinery subzone must be attributed to feedstock admitted into said petroleum refinery subzone in the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution must be based on records maintained by the operator. Attribution may be made by applying one of the authorized methods set forth in this section. Records must be maintained on a weight or volume basis.
(1)
Producibility.
The producibility method of attribution requires that records be kept to attribute final products to feedstocks which are eligible for attribution as set forth in this section during the current or prior manufacturing period.
(2)
Actual production records.
An operator may use its actual production records as provided for under § 146.95(b) of this subpart.
(3)
Other inventory method.
An operator may use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of accounting (see § 191.22(c) of this chapter). The use of this method is illustrated in the appendix to this part.
(b)
Feedstock eligible for attribution.
Only a feedstock that has been admitted into the refinery subzone is eligible for attribution. For a given manufacturing period, the quantity of feedstock eligible for attribution may be computed as beginning inventory, plus receipts less shipments of feedstock out of the subzone, and less ending inventory.
(c)
Consumption or removal of final product.
Each final product that is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to a feedstock eligible for attribution during the current or a prior manufacturing period. Each final product attributed as being produced from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be assigned the proper relative value as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Relative value.
A relative value calculation is required when two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of duty must be converted to specific rates of duty in order to make a relative value calculation.
(e)
Privileged status after admission.
Nonprivileged status feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed in an empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with § 146.95(b). A request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is granted.
The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in the tank.
(f)
Consistent use required.
The operator must use the selected method, measurement (weight or volume), and the price of product consistently (see § 146.92(g) of this subpart and paragraph (a) of this section).
§ 146.94
Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period.
(a)
Feedstock admitted into the refinery subzone.
The operator must maintain appropriate inventory records during the manufacturing period to substantiate the feedstock(s) eligible for attribution under § 146.93(b) and in accordance with the operator's selected attribution method.
(b)
Final product consumed in or removed from subzone.
The operator must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or removed from the subzone.
(c)
Consumption or removal.
The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see section II of the appendix to this part).
(d)
Gain or loss.
A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in a final product attributed to a non-privileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless otherwise exempt from duty.
(e)
Determining gain or loss; acceptable methods
—(1)
Converting volume to weight.
Volume measurements may be converted to weight measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors to account for gain or loss.
(2)
Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain or loss.
A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain.
(3)
Calculating volume difference.
Volume difference may be determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given period with the amount of final products produced during the period, and then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately.
§ 146.95
Methods of attribution.
(a)
Producibility
—(1)
General.
A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks which were eligible for attribution during the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution of final products is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution.
(2)
Industry standards of potential production.
The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66-16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing period.
(3)
Attribution to product or feedstock not listed in T.D. 66-16.
(i) For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66-16, the operator must submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate port director. The port director shall refer the request to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit (“ORA”), who will verify the refiner's records
and will coordinate with the Director, Office of Laboratories and Scientific Services (“OLSS”). The Director, ORA, shall either approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, the Director, ORA, shall publish a modification of T.D. 66-16. If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, the operator shall use its actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation upon the Customs Service demand and subject to verification.
(ii) An operator may attribute a final product to a feedstock in excess of the amount allowed under T.D. 66-16, when authorized by Customs, without losing the ability to attribute under T.D. 66-16 for all other feedstock-final product combinations. The operator must use its actual production records for the requested feedstock-final product combination. The operator must agree in writing that it will not, and it will not enable any other person, to file a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313 inconsistent with those actual production records for that feedstock-final product combination. The operator shall file its request in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Director, ORA, and the Director, OLSS, must determine whether T.D. 66-16 needs to be modified and shall publish in the Customs Bulletin each approval granted under this paragraph and request public comments with each such approval.
(4)
Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value.
If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock a relative value must be assigned (see section IV of the appendix to this part).
(b)
Refinery operating records.
An operator may use the actual refinery operating records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's operating conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that it actually uses these conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever conventions are elected by the operator, they must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. Additionally, Customs may use these records to test the validity of admissions into the subzone, consumption within and removals from the subzone.

# Example.
If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in a day tank and treats that product as a three-part mixture in its production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed of the three materials. If, in the alternative, the operator assumes that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being composed of the first material put into the day tank, the second product as composed of the second material put into the day tank, and the third product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, Customs will accept that convention also.
§ 146.96
Approval of other recordkeeping systems.
(a)
Approval procedure.
An operator must seek prior approval of another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit:
(1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented;
(2) A mathematical example covering at least two months which shows the amounts attributed, all necessary relative value calculations, the dates of consumption and removal, and the amounts and dates that the transactions are reported to Customs.
(b)
Failure to comply.
Requests received that fail to comply with paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the requester with the defects noted by the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit.
(c)
Determination by Director.
When the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit, determines that the recordkeeping procedures provide an acceptable basis for verifying the admissions and removals from or consumption in a refinery subzone, the Director will issue a written approval to the applicant.
Pt. 146, App.

# Appendix to Part 146—Guidelines for Determining Producibility and Relative Values for Oil Refinery Zones
Where an example is set out in this appendix, the example is for purposes of illustrating the application of a provision, and where there is any inconsistency between the example and the provision, the provision prevails to the extent of the inconsistency. Alternative formats are also acceptable so long as they are consistent with the provisions of this part.

# I. Attribution Using Producibility Showing Manufacturing Periods From Admission to Removal Within a Calendar Month.
Volume losses and gains accounted for by weight.

# Day 1
Receipt into the refinery subzone during a 30-day month:
50,000 pounds privileged foreign (PF) class II crude oil.
50,000 pounds PF class III crude oil.
50,000 pounds domestic status class III crude oil.

# Day 10
Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 pounds of aviation gasoline.
The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 10. The refiner must first attribute the designated source of the aviation gasoline.
In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported aviation gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables for potential production (T.V. 66-16), class II crude has a 30% potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000 × .30). The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the privileged foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000 × .40). The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation gasoline.
The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class III crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the 50,000 pounds of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged foreign class III crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status class III crude oil would be available for further production, of which up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline.

# Day 21
Receipt in the refinery subzone:
50,000 pounds PF status class I crude oil.
50,000 pounds PF status class IV crude oil.

# Day 30
Removal from the refinery subzone:
30,000 pounds of motor gasoline for consumption.
10,000 pounds of jet fuel sold to the US Air Force for use in military aircraft.
10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline sold to a U.S. commuter airline for domestic flights.
10,000 pounds of kerosene for exportation.
To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 are attributed as the designated sources for the products removed on Day 30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses to attribute the crude oils that were admitted on Day 21 as the designated sources of the products removed on Day 30 using the production standards published in T.D. 66-16, the manufacturing period is Day 21 to Day 30. This choice will be important if a relative value calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, because the law requires the value used for computing the relative value to be the average per unit value of each product for the manufacturing period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is separated into two or more products that are removed from the subzone refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between the manufacturing period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the calculation.
In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to attribute the production of the exported kerosene and the sale of the jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For the same reason, the refiner would try to attribute the removed motor gasoline and the aviation gasoline for the commuter airline to the domestic crude oil.
Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of the domestic status class III crude as the source of the 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter airline. Since no other aviation gasoline could have been produced from the crude oils that were admitted into the refinery subzone Day 1, the refiner must attribute the remainder to the crude oils that entered production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D. 66-16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 10,000 pounds (50,000 × .20). Likewise, the class IV crude oil could
produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000 × .17).
The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to 27,300 pounds (35,000−5,000 × .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the motor gasoline. This would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class III crude available for further production for other than aviation gasoline or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign crude oil. The refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered production on Day 1 as the source for the remaining 2,700 pounds of motor gasoline.
This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which no more than 27,400 pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner attributes the jet fuel that is removed from the refinery subzone for the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300 × .65). Designating that class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 22,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline and the jet fuel, under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been separated from the privileged foreign class II crude oil, a relative value calculation would be required.
The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner could attribute the privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel (22,300 × .65). The refiner chooses to attribute the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet fuel. The refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000 × .50).

# II. Attribution on a FIFO Basis
(Accounting for volume losses or gains by the weight method)

# Day 1-5
Transfer, into the Refinery Subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 150 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) Class II crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds.

# Day 6
Removal from the refinery subzone 119 barrels of residual oils to customs territory, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.
Since the operator uses the FIFO method of attribution, as the product is removed from the subzone, or consumed or lost within the subzone, attribution must be to the oldest feedstock available for attribution. Accordingly, the 40,000 pounds of residual oils will be attributed to 40,000 pounds of the PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5.

# Day 10
Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks 4 barrels of domestic motor gasoline blend stock, equivalent to 1,000 pounds to motor gasoline blending tank.

# Day 6-15
Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 320 barrels of Domestic Class III crude oil, equivalent to 100,000 pounds.

# Day 16
Removal from the refinery subzone 14 barrels of asphalt to customs territory, equivalent to 5,000 pounds.
The 5,000 pounds of asphalt will be attributed to 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5.

# Day 17
Removal from the refinery subzone, 324 barrels of motor gasoline to customs territory, equivalent to 81,000 pounds.
The 81,000 pounds of motor gasoline will be attributed to 1,000 pounds of domestic motor gasoline blend stock from Day 10, to the remaining 5,000 pounds of PF Class II crude oil from Day 1-5 and 75,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6-15.

# Day 16-20
Transfer, into the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks into process 169 barrels of Privileged Foreign (PF) Class III crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds.

# Day 22
Removal from the refinery subzone, 214 barrels of jet fuel for exportation, equivalent to 60,000 pounds.
The 60,000 pounds of jet fuel will be attributed to the remaining 25,000 pounds of domestic Class III crude oil from Day 6-15 and 35,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20.

# Day 21-25
Transfer, into the refinery subzone from one or more storage tanks into process, 143 barrels of domestic Class I crude oil, equivalent to 50,000 pounds.

# Day 30 (End of the Manufacturing Period)
It is determined that during the manufacturing period just ended, that 34 barrels of
fuel, equivalent to 10,000 pounds was consumed, and 5 barrels of oil, equivalent to 1,500 pounds was lost in the refining production process within the refinery subzone.
The 10,000 pounds of fuel consumed will be attributed 10,000 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. The 1,500 pounds of oil lost in the refining production process will be attributed to 1,500 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20. The remaining 3,500 pounds of PF Class III crude oil from Day 16-20 will be the first to be attributed during the next manufacturing period.

# III. Relative Value Calculation
Because privileged foreign feedstocks transferred into process during Day 1-5 and Day 16-20 have two or more products attributed to them, each feedstock will require a relative value calculation.
Relative value calculation for UIN Day 1-5, 50,000 pounds, equivalent to 150 barrels.

Since jet fuel was exported, no duty is applicable. Fuel consumed for refinery process was consumed within the subzone premises and did not enter customs territory, thus no duty is applicable (assume refinery not barred by duty-free consumption restriction). Likewise, the process loss occurred entirely within the subzone. Therefore, no duty is applicable.

# IV. Attribution to Privileged Foreign Feedstock; Relative Value; Monthly Manufacturing Period, Weekly Entries, Attribution to a Prior Period; Volume Loss or Gain Shown by Volume Differences.
An operator who elects to attribute on a monthly basis files the following estimated removal of final products for the first week in September:
Jet Fuel (deemed exported on international flights)
20,000
Gasoline—Domestic Consumption
15,000
Duty-free certified as emergency war material
10,000
Petroleum coke exportations
10,000
Distillate for consumption
5,000
Petrochemicals exported
10,000
Total removals
70,000
Because it does not elect to make attributions for feedstocks that were charged to operating units during the same week, the operator attributes the estimated removals to final products made during August from the following feedstocks:
Class II PF (privileged foreign) crude
20,000
Class III PF crude
35,000
Class III D (domestic) crude
20,000
Class III NPF (nonprivileged foreign crude

# V. Weekly Entry, Weekly Manufacturing Period, and Relative Values Calculated on the Actual Weighted Average Values at the End of the Week.
On the weekly estimated production CF 3461, the refiner is required to provide a pro forma invoice or schedule showing the number of units of each type of merchandise to be removed during the week and their zone and dutiable values. For example, on CF 3461 the refiner estimates the following shipments and relative values for the next week and files this on the preceding Friday.

Note: No change in amended total duties, because duty is computed on total quantity of class III crude used. The difference is amongst the various products,
i.e.
, estimated weekly CF 7501 duties paid for Motor Gasoline was $2,317, while the reconciled amount as shown above is $2,298. Additional duties owed or refunds due would depend on the reconciliation of the weekly entry as an entirety.

Note: Actual monthly reconciliation data could result in attributions on a product basis that are less than or greater than weekly distributions. This is due to the “weighing” of the data
i.e.
, motor gasoline on a weekly basis was $10,996 as compared to $10,379 as above. No additional duties are due to the averaging.

Entry of unaccompanied shipments of effects subject to personal exemptions.
(a)
Declaration to support free entry.
When effects claimed to be free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.10, 9804.00.20, 9804.00.25, 9804.00.35 or 9804.00.45, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), do not accompany the importer on his arrival in the United States or are forwarded in bond, a declaration of the importer on Customs Form 3299, or its electronic equivalent, shall be required to support the claim for free entry. However, an oral declaration may be accepted in lieu of a written declaration on Customs Form 3299, for effects of a resident which are free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.10 or 9804.00.45. Effects of returning residents entitled to free entry under subheadings 9804.00.10 or 9804.00.45 (except automobiles and other vehicles of residents returning from countries other than Canada or Mexico) need not be itemized if a written declaration is required.
(b)
Exemption from entry.
If the port director is satisfied that an entry would serve no good purpose, none need be required, but evidence of ownership for Customs purposes, such as a carrier's certificate or properly endorsed bill of lading, shall be required with the declaration. Such exemption from entry may also be applied with respect to household effects or tools of trade entitled to free entry (see §§ 148.52 and 148.53 respectively) which are unaccompanied or forwarded in bond.

(a) The person claiming the status shall agree to export all such articles upon his departure from the United States, except articles imported as gifts under subheading 9804.00.30, and articles consumed during his visit;
(b) When required to do so, the person claiming the status shall list all articles of substantial value which he is importing on Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent in duplicate, noting thereon the expected duration of his visit. He shall present the completed form to the inspecting officer who will initial both copies and return the duplicate to him;

(b)
After examination is begun.
A passenger shall be permitted to add an article to his declaration after examination of his baggage has begun if, before any undeclared article is found, the passenger advises the examining officer that he has such an article and the officer is satisfied that there was no fraudulent intent. Under no circumstances shall a passenger be permitted to add any undeclared article to his declaration after such article has been discovered by the examining officer.
§ 148.17
Declaration on arrival incidental to further foreign travel.

Declaration on incidental arrival.
A resident who enters the United States merely as an incident of foreign travel and who will continue his foreign travel before finally returning to the United States from a continuous trip must declare, but need not clear through CBP, any articles he has acquired or had repaired or altered while abroad. The incidental character of the arrival must be made known to the CBP officer.
(b)
Treatment of articles on incidental arrival.
In order that a resident may claim the $800 or $1,600 exemption upon his final arrival in the United States from a continuous trip, articles accompanying him at the time of an incidental arrival may be exported directly from CBP custody or after transportation in bond, or the articles may be left in CBP custody if the resident upon his final return is to arrive at the CBP facility where the articles are deposited.
(c)
Failure to advise of incidental character of arrival.
If the traveler fails to advise the CBP officer of the incidental character of his arrival, or for other reason declares any articles for allowance of the $800 or $1,600 exemption, such declaration will mark the beginning of the respective period or periods during which a further exemption cannot be granted.

Failure to declare.
(a)
Penalty incurred.
Any article in the baggage of a passenger arriving from a foreign country which is not declared as required by this subpart shall be seized if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and the personal penalty prescribed by section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be demanded from the passenger. If the article is not seized, a claim for the personal penalty shall be made against the person who imported the article without declaration. No duty shall be collected, because undeclared articles are treated as smuggled.
(b)
Remission of liability.
When an article not declared as required by this subpart is found in the baggage of a person arriving in the United States, the personal penalty and forfeiture may be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter.

A passenger who makes any false or fraudulent statement or engages in other conduct within the purview of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), whereby a Customs officer is or may be induced to pass an article free of duty or at less than the proper amount of duty, or to treat an article in some other manner in order to obtain a benefit, shall be deemed to have violated 19 U.S.C. 1592. In any such case the article involved shall be seized only if one or more of the conditions set forth in section 162.75 of this chapter are present, if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and if such seizure is otherwise practicable, unless the article is in the possession of an innocent holder for value who has full right to possession as against any party to the Customs violation. If seizure is not made, an amount equivalent to the maximum penalty which may be assessed in accordance with the passenger's degree of culpability as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1592(c) shall be demanded from the passenger. The amount demanded in lieu of seizure shall be determined in accordance with the guidelines contained in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter. In all
cases, the estimated duties shall be demanded of the passenger as soon as possible after the discovery of the violation. Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded unless the merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

(2) $800 in the case of a direct arrival from a beneficiary country, as defined in U.S. Note 4 to Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, whether or not the articles accompany the returning resident.

Articles acquired elsewhere than in such insular possessions that do not accompany the returning resident are not entitled to the duty exemption.
(b)
Application to articles of highest rate of duty.
The $800 or $1,600 exemption will be applied to the aggregate fair retail value in the country of acquisition of the articles acquired abroad which are subject to the highest rates of duty. If an internal revenue tax is applicable, it will be combined with the duty in determining which rates are highest.
(c)
Gifts.
An article acquired abroad by a returning resident and imported by him to be disposed of after importation as his bona fide gift is considered to be for the personal use of the returning resident and may be included in the exemption.
(d)
Tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.
Cigars, cigarettes, manufactured tobacco, and alcoholic beverages may be included in the exemption to which a returning resident is entitled, with the following limits:
(1) No more than 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars may be included, except that in the case of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands of the United States the cigarette limit is 1,000, not more than 200 of which shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such locations;

(f)
Remainder not applicable to subsequent journey.

Family grouping of exemptions for articles acquired abroad.
(a)
Grouping of exemptions.
Each member of a family is entitled to the $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad, subject to the conditions prescribed in this subpart. When members of a family residing in one household travel together on their return to the United States, the $800 or $1,600 exemption to which the several members of the family may be entitled may be grouped and allowed without regard to which member of the family is the owner of the articles. However, a group exemption will not include an exemption for a family member not entitled to it in his own right, nor will a group exemption be applied to any property of such a member. The exemption of a family member who has not attained the age of 21 will not be applied under the group exemption to alcoholic beverages. No exemptions allowable to individuals employed by the household and accompanying the family but not related by blood, marriage, domestic relationship, or adoption will be included in the family grouping.
(b)
Members of a family residing in one household.
“Members of a family residing in one household” includes all persons who:
(1) Are related by blood, marriage, domestic relationship, or adoption;
(2) Lived together in one household at their last permanent residence; and
(3) Intend to live in one household after their arrival in the United States.
(c)
Domestic relationship.
As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the term “domestic relationship” includes foster children, stepchildren, half-siblings, legal wards, other dependents, individuals with an
in loco parentis
or guardianship relationship, and two adults who are in a committed relationship including, but not limited to, long-time companions, and couples in civil unions, or domestic partnerships, wherein the partners are financially interdependent, and are not married to, or a partner of, anyone else. The term “domestic relationship” does not extend to roommates or other cohabitants not otherwise meeting this definition.

§ 148.35
Length of stay for exemption of articles acquired abroad.
(a)
Requirements for allowance of $800 or $1,600 exemption.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or in paragraph (b) of this section, the $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad will not be allowed unless the returning resident has remained beyond the territorial limits of the
United States for a period of not less than 48 hours. The $800 exemption may be allowed on articles acquired abroad by a returning resident arriving directly from Mexico without regard to the length of time the person has remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.
(b)
Not required for allowance of $1,600 exemption on return from the Virgin Islands.
The $1,600 exemption applicable in the case of the arrival of a returning resident directly or indirectly from the Virgin Islands of the United States may be allowed without regard to the length of time such person has remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.
(c)
Computation of time.
The 48-hour period a returning resident must have completed abroad to be entitled to an exemption will be computed exactly. For example, a resident leaving United States territory at 1:30 p.m. on June 1 would complete the 48-hour period at 1:30 p.m. on June 3.
[T.D. 73-27, 38 FR 2449, Jan. 26, 1973, as amended by T.D. 86-118, 51 FR 22516, June 20, 1986; T.D. 97-75, 62 FR 46442, Sept. 3, 1997; CBP Dec. 09-37, 74 FR 48855, Sept. 25, 2009]
§ 148.36
Frequency of allowance of exemption for articles acquired abroad.
(a)
30-day period.
The $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad will not be granted to a returning resident who has taken advantage of such exemption within the 30-day period immediately preceding his return to the United States. The date of the returning resident's latest prior arrival on which he declared articles acquired abroad for allowance of the $800 or $1,600 exemption will be deemed the date he took advantage of the applicable exemption.
(b)
Computation of time.
The 30-day period immediately preceding the resident's return will be computed by excluding the day of arrival and counting backward 30 days. For example, in the case of an arrival on May 28, the resident would not be entitled to the $800 or $1,600 exemption if he had taken advantage of such exemption on or after the preceding April 28.
[T.D. 73-27, 38 FR 2449, Jan. 26, 1973, as amended by T.D. 86-118, 51 FR 22516, June 20, 1986; T.D. 97-75, 62 FR 46442, Sept. 3, 1997; CBP Dec. 09-37, 74 FR 48855, Sept. 25, 2009]
§ 148.37
Replacement of unsatisfactory articles acquired abroad.
(a)
Free entry of replacement articles.
An article furnished by a foreign supplier to replace a like article of comparable value previously exempted from duty under the $800 or $1,600 exemptions for articles acquired abroad will be allowed free entry if the original article is found by the importer to be unsatisfactory and the procedures provided by paragraph (b) of this section are followed. In any case in which the importer has failed to follow these procedures, the port director may allow free entry of the replacement article if he is satisfied that the unsatisfactory article was timely exported and that the failure to comply with the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section was due to inadvertence or lack of experience in customs matters and was without willful intent to avoid CBP supervision.
(b)
Procedure for replacement.
Any article previously exempted from duty under the $800 or $1,600 exemptions found by the importer to be unsatisfactory must be returned to CBP custody and exported under CBP supervision at the expense of the importer within 60 days after its importation. A certificate of registration on CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer with instructions as to its use when the unsatisfactory article is exported for replacement under the provisions of subheading 9804.00.75, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
(c)
Articles found damaged upon declaration.
The requirement that the original article be exported under CBP supervision does not apply when a duplicate article is furnished by a foreign supplier as a replacement for an article declared for entry under the $800 or $1,600 exemption and found by the CBP inspector or other examining officer to be so damaged as to constitute a nonimportation (§ 158.11 of this chapter). In
such a case, CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer at the time the determination of nonimportation is made and the duplicate replacement will be considered to have been acquired abroad for the purposes of the $800 or $1,600 exemption provision, provided no charge is made to the importer for the duplicate replacement.

Sale of articles acquired abroad.
An article brought in under the $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad for personal or household use and subsequently sold is not dutiable or subject to forfeiture by reason of the sale if the returning resident actually acquired and imported the article for his bona fide personal or household use and not for sale.

(b)
Unauthorized use or failure to export.
If any automobile exempted from duty under subheading 9804.00.60, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), is used otherwise than for the purpose expressed or is not returned abroad within 30 days, without prior payment to a port director of the duty which would have been payable at the time of entry if entered without benefit of the exemption, the automobile or its value (to be recovered from the importer) shall be subject to forfeiture.

Household effects used abroad not less than 1 year by a family of which the importer was a resident member for not less than 1 year during the period of use may be allowed free entry whether or not the importer owned the effects at the time of such use.

(b)
Proof of use.
In order to obtain free entry for household effects under this section, the use of the effects abroad for 1 year must be proven to the satisfaction of the port director. The port director, in his discretion, may require evidence of use other than the declaration provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.

admitted free of duty under this exemption unless the port director is satisfied from the importer's explanation that the effects were unavoidably detained beyond the 10-year period.

The entry shall be made under subheading 9816.00.20 or 9816.00.40, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), and is subject to the limitations and conditions in this subpart. Except as provided in § 148.105, the flat rate of duty shall be assessed in place of any rates of duty other than free rates of duty. If the dutiable amount of the article(s) is over $1,000 fair retail value, the flat rate of duty provisions shall apply to the amount not over $1,000 fair retail value, and the excess amount shall be valued under section 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a). The article(s) shall be classified under the appropriate subheading number of the tariff schedule. For purposes of this subpart, “fair retail value” in the country of acquisition means the price at which the merchandise is freely offered there for sale at retail and “country of acquisition” includes America Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.
Two examples of the application of this subpart are set forth below:

# Example 1:
B returned from Europe where he acquired merchandise having a fair retail value of $1,950. Assume for purposes of this example that (1) in addition to the personal exemption of $400, $100 of the merchandise carries a free rate of duty, (2) allowances and exemptions have not been used within the past 30 days, and (3) all articles in excess of allowances and exemptions and duty-free articles are dutiable at rates other than the flat rate.
B presents his baggage to the Customs officer for examination and his declaration for verification. Duty is figured as follows:
Fair retail value
Duty
(a) The $400 personal exemption
$400
(b) Articles which carry a free rate of duty
100
(c) The $1,000 flat rate of duty allowance calculated at:

The articles not covered by exemptions, allowances, and duty-free rates will be valued under section 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and duty calculated at rates other than the flat rate.

# Example 2:
Mr. and Mrs. B return from the U.S. Virgin Islands. During the trip, they acquired merchandise having a fair retail value of $4,900. Assume for purposes of this example that (1) in addition to the personal exemption of $1,200 for each returning resident, $100 of the merchandise carries a free rate of duty, (2) allowances and exemptions have not been used within the past 30 days, (3) all articles in excess of allowances and exemptions and duty-free articles are dutiable at rates other than the flat rate, and (4) Mrs. B made $400 in purchases on the trip, none of which carries a free rate of duty.
Mr. and Mrs. B present their baggage to the Customs officer for examination and their declaration for verification. Duty is figured as follows:
Fair retail value
Duty
(a) The $1,200 personal exemptions for residents returning from the U.S. Virgin Islands are grouped for a total of
$2,400
(b) Articles which carry a free rate of duty

# Subpart K—Unaccompanied Shipments From American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States
§ 148.110
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart are applicable to articles not accompanying a person, including a crewmember, which
are purchased in
and
shipped from American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States. However, this subpart is not applicable to the importation of unaccompanied articles in a manner prohibited by law or regulation (e.g., mail shipments of alcoholic beverages or alcoholic beverages shipped other than by mail in excess of quantities authorized by State laws or regulations).
The following is a summary of the procedure to be followed to obtain the benefits of this subpart: A person purchasing articles in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States would receive a sales slip, invoice, or other evidence of purchase which he would present to the Customs officer along with his baggage declaration, Customs Form 6059-B, and a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles, Customs Form 255. The latter form is prepared in triplicate for each shipment to follow. The Customs officer would verify the information, indicate on the form whether the article or articles were free of duty, dutiable at the flat rate, or a combination of the foregoing, and validate the form. Two copies would be returned to the traveler, who would send one form to the vendor. Upon receipt of the form the vendor would place it in an envelope, affix it to the outside of the package, clearly mark the package “Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment,” and send the package to the traveler, generally via mail, although it could be sent by other means. If sent through the mail, the package would be examined by Customs and forwarded to the Postal Service for delivery. Any duties due would be collected by the mailman. If the shipment arrives other than through the mail, the traveler would be notified by the carrier when the article arrives. Entry would be made by the carrier or the traveler at the customhouse. Any duties due would be collected at that time.

The packages need not be corded and sealed in accordance with § 151.7(a), but the port director may make such preliminary examination as he deems necessary to identify the merchandise with the invoice.
(c)
Removal of merchandise and notification of assembly.
After the bond required by § 151.7(d) has been filed and any necessary preliminary examination has been made, the port director may permit the merchandise to be removed to the place at which it is to be assembled for examination. Within 90 days after such removal, unless an extension has been applied for and granted by the port director, the importer shall notify the port director that the merchandise has been assembled and is ready for examination, whereupon final examination shall be made.

(b)
What is a “Customs-accredited laboratory”?
“Commercial laboratories” are individuals and commercial organizations that analyze merchandise,
i.e.,
determine its composition and/or characteristics, through laboratory analysis. A “Customs-accredited laboratory” is a commercial laboratory, within the United States, that has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Executive Director, pursuant to this section, the capability to perform analysis of certain commodities to determine elements relating to the admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of imported merchandise. Customs accreditation extends only to the performance of such functions as are vested in, or delegated to, Customs.
(c)
What are the obligations of a Customs-accredited laboratory?
A commercial laboratory accredited by Customs agrees to the following conditions and requirements:
(1) To comply with the requirements of part 151, Customs Regulations (19
CFR part 151), and to conduct professional services in conformance with approved standards and procedures, including procedures which may be required by the Commissioner of Customs or the Executive Director;
(2) To have no interest in or other connection with any business or other activity which might affect the unbiased performance of duties as a Customs-accredited laboratory. It is understood that this does not prohibit acceptance of the usual fees for professional services;
(3) To maintain the ability,
i.e.,
the instrumentation, equipment, qualified staff, facilities, etc., to perform the services for which the laboratory is accredited, and allow the Executive Director to evaluate that ability on a periodic basis by such means as on-site inspections, demonstrations of analysis procedures, reviews of submitted records, and proficiency testing through check samples;
(4) To retain those laboratory records beyond the five-year record-retention period and samples (see paragraph (j)(1) of this section) specified by Customs as necessary to address matters concerned in pending litigation, and, if laboratory operations or accreditation cease, to contact Customs immediately regarding the disposition of records/samples retained;
(5) To promptly investigate any circumstance which might affect the accuracy of work performed as an accredited laboratory, to correct the situation immediately, and to notify the port director, the Executive Director, and the Center director of such matters, their consequences, and any corrective action taken or that needs to be taken; and
(6) To immediately notify the port director, the Executive Director, and the Center director of any attempt to impede, influence, or coerce laboratory personnel in the performance of their duties, or of any decision to terminate laboratory operations or accredited status. Further, within 5 days of any changes involving legal name, address, ownership, parent-subsidiary relationships, bond, other offices or sites, or approved signatories to notify the Executive Director by certified mail.
(d)
What are the commodity groups for which accreditation may be sought?
(1) Commercial laboratories may apply for accreditation to perform tests for any of the commodity groups listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Applicable test procedures are listed in Commodity Group Brochures and the U.S. Customs Laboratory Methods Manual. Application may be made for accreditation in more than one commodity group. At the discretion of the Executive Director accreditation may be granted for subgroups of tests within a commodity group or for commodity groups not specifically enumerated.

(f)
What are the approval/reapproval fee requirements?
—(1)
In general.
A fixed fee, representing Customs administrative overhead expense, will be assessed for each application for approval or reapproval. In addition, associated assessments, representing the actual costs associated with travel and per diem of Customs employees related to verification of application criteria and background investigations will be charged. The combination of the fixed fee and associated assessments represent reimbursement to Customs for costs related to approval and reapproval. The fixed fee will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the
Federal Register.
Based on a review of the actual costs associated with the program, the fixed fee may be adjusted
periodically; any changes will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the
Federal Register.
(i)
Approval fees.
A nonrefundable pre-payment equal to 50 percent of the fixed approval fee to cover preliminary processing costs must accompany each application for approval. Before a gauger will be approved, it must submit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period the associated charges assessed for the approval and the balance of the fixed approval fee.
(ii)
Reapproval fees.
Before a gauger will be reapproved, it must submit to Customs, at the billing address specified, within the 30 day billing period, the fixed reapproval fee.
(2)
Disputes.
In the event a gauger disputes the charges assessed for travel and per diem costs associated with scheduled inspection visits, it may file an appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of the assessment with the Executive Director. The appeal letter must specify which charges are in dispute and provide such supporting documentation as may be available for each allegation. The Executive Director will make findings of fact concerning the merits of an appeal and communicate the agency decision to the gauger in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal.
(g)
Can existing Customs-approved gaugers continue to operate?
Commercial gaugers approved by the Executive Director prior to December 8, 1993, will retain approval under these regulations provided that they conduct their business in a manner consistent with the administrative portions of this section. This paragraph does not pertain to any gauger which has had its approval suspended or revoked. Gaugers which have had their approvals continued under this section will have their status reevaluated on their next triennial inspection date which is no earlier than three years after the effective date of this regulation. At the time of reapproval, these gaugers must meet the requirements of this section and remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period the fixed reapproval fee. Failure to meet these requirements will result in revocation or suspension of the approval.
(h)
How will Customs-approved gaugers operate?
—(1)
Reports
—(i)
Contents of reports.
The measurement results from a Customs-approved gauger that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry, in the absence of measurements conducted by Customs, will be accepted by Customs, provided that the importer of record certifies that the measurement was of the merchandise in the entry. All reports must measure net landed quantity, except in the case of crude petroleum of Heading 2709, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which may be measured by gross quantity. Reports must use the appropriate HTSUS units of quantity, e.g., liters, barrels, or kilograms.

(ii)
Status of commercial reports where Customs also gauges merchandise.
Nothing in these regulations will preclude Customs from gauging a shipment which has been gauged by a Customs-approved gauger at the request of an importer. In cases where a shipment has been gauged by both Customs and a Customs-approved gauger, all Customs actions will be based upon the gauging reports issued by Customs, unless the Executive Director advises other actions. If Customs gauges merchandise, it will release the report of its measurements to the importer of record or
its agent upon request unless the gauging information is proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent, or developed by Customs for enforcement purposes.
(2)
Recordkeeping requirements.
Customs-approved gaugers must maintain records of the type normally kept in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of law, and make them available during normal business hours for Customs inspection.

§ 151.14
Use of commercial laboratory tests in liquidation.
The analysis method for crude petroleum contained in ASTM D96 or other approved analysis method and as determined by a Customs-accredited commercial laboratory shall be used for Customs purposes if the difference between the value found by the commercial laboratory and the value found by the Customs laboratory does not exceed 0.11 percent. If the difference exceeds this limit and the Customs-accredited commercial laboratory cannot establish that Customs is in error, then the Customs results shall be used.
[T.D. 90-78, 55 FR 40167, Oct. 2, 1990, as amended by T.D. 99-67, 64 FR 48543, Sept. 7, 1999]
§ 151.15
Movement of merchandise to a centralized examination station.
(a)
Permission to transfer merchandise for examination.
When a shipment requires examination at a centralized examination station (CES), Customs Form 3461, or Customs Form 3461 (ALT), or their electronic equivalents, for land border cargo, or an attachment to either, may be used to request permission to transfer the merchandise to a CES. The entry filer must write, type or stamp the following lines on
the form or attachment, and must supply the information called for on the first three lines:
Containers to be transferred: ______ All or,
Container #'s ______, ______, ______←
To CES__________________________________←
Approved by: U.S. Customs Inspector______←
Date__________________________________←
Unless the port director exercises his authority pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the reviewing inspector will initial and date the form or attachment being used, or stamp one copy of the Customs Form 3461 or 3461 (ALT), or their electronic equivalents if required by the port director. A copy of this document will act as notification and authorization to the entry filer that the merchandise must be transferred to the importer-designated CES unless another CES is designated by the port director under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Assumption of liability during transfer.
Merchandise designated for examination may be transferred from the importing carrier's point of unlading or from a bonded facility, to a CES, only if the transfer takes place under bond. The entry filer shall select one of the following bonded movements for the transfer to the CES unless the type of bonded movement to be used is specified by the port director under paragraph (d) of this section:
(1) If the merchandise is tranferred directly to a CES by an importing carrier, the importing carrier shall remain liable under the terms of its international carrier bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.
(2) If the merchandise is transferred directly from a bonded carrier's facility to a CES or is delivered directly to the CES by a bonded carrier, the bonded carrier shall remain liable under the terms of its custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.
(3) If containerized cargo, including excess loose cargo that is part of the containerized cargo, is transferred to a CES operator's own facility using his own vehicles, the CES operator shall be liable under the terms of his custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise to the CES facility.
(4) If the importer or his agent acting as importer of record transfers the merchandise to a CES, that importer or agent shall assume liability under his importation and entry bond (see § 151.7(d) of this part) for the proper transfer of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.
(c)
Annual blanket transfer.
Port directors may institute an annual blanket transfer application procedure to facilitate any of the bonded movements described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Designation of bonded movement and CES to be used.
In the event the port director deems it necessary, he may direct the type of bonded movement to be used to transfer merchandise to a CES and may designate the CES at which examination must take place. In either case the port director's action will be noted on the Customs Form 3461 or 3461 (ALT), or their electronic equivalents, or attachment thereto.
[T.D. 93-6, 58 FR 5606, Jan. 22, 1993, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61290, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 151.16
Detention of merchandise.
(a)
Exemptions from applicability.
The provisions of this section are not applicable to detentions effected by CBP on behalf of other agencies of the U.S. Government in whom the determination of admissibility is vested.
(b)
Decision to detain or release.
Within five business days from the date on which merchandise is presented for CBP examination, CBP will decide whether to release or detain merchandise. Merchandise that is not released within the five business day period will be considered to be detained merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1499(c)(1). For purposes of this section, merchandise will be considered to be presented for CBP examination when it is in a condition to be viewed and examined by a CBP officer. Mere presentation to the examining officer of a cargo van, container, or instrument of international traffic in which the merchandise to be examined is contained will not be considered to be presentation of merchandise for
CBP examination for purposes of this section. Except when merchandise is examined at the public stores, the importer must pay all costs relating to the preparation and transportation of merchandise for CBP examination.
(c)
Notice of detention.
If a decision to detain merchandise is made, or the merchandise is not released within the five business day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, CBP will issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in such merchandise within five business days from such decision or failure to release. Issuance of a notice of detention is not to be construed as a final determination as to admissibility of the merchandise. The notice will be prepared by the CBP officer detaining the merchandise and will advise the importer or other interested party of the:
(1) Initiation of the detention, including the date the merchandise was presented for examination;
(2) Specific reason for the detention;
(3) Anticipated length of the detention;
(4) Nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and
(5) Nature of any information which, if supplied to CBP, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.
(d)
Providing testing results.
Upon written request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, CBP will provide copies of the results of any testing conducted on the merchandise together with a description of the testing procedures and methodologies used (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by CBP for enforcement purposes). The results and test description will be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.
(e)
Final determinations.
A final determination with respect to admissibility of detained merchandise will be made within 30 days from the date the merchandise is presented for CBP examination. Such a determination may be the subject of a protest.
(f)
Effect of failure to make a determination.
The failure by CBP to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for CBP examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, will be treated as a decision by CBP to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 514(a)(4) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(4)). Such a deemed exclusion may be the subject of a protest.
(g)
Failure to decide protest.
If a protest which is filed as a result of a final determination or a deemed exclusion of detained merchandise is not allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed, it will be treated as having been denied on such 30th day for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1581.
(h)
Decision before commencement of court action.
CBP may at any time after a deemed denial of a protest as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but before commencement of a court action as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, grant a protest and permit release of detained merchandise, or deny a protest in accordance with § 174.30 of this chapter.
(i)
Commencement of court action; burden of proof and decisions of the court.
Once a court action respecting a detention is commenced, unless CBP establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court will grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.
(j)
Seizure and forfeiture; denial of entry or exportation.
If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited. In lieu of seizure and forfeiture, where authorized by law, CBP may deny entry and permit the merchandise to be exported, with the importer responsible for paying all expenses of exportation.

Unlading facilities for bulk sugar.
When dutiable sugar is to be imported in bulk, a full description of the facilities to be used in unlading the sugar shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Customs as far as possible in advance of the date of importation, and special instructions will be issued as to the methods to be applied in weighing and sampling such sugar.
§ 151.25
Mixing classes of sugar.
No regulations relative to the weighing, taring, sampling, classifying, and testing of imported sugar shall be so construed as to permit mixing together sugar of different classes, such as centrifugal, beet, molasses, or any sugar different in character from those mentioned, for the purpose of weighing, taring, sampling, or testing.
§ 151.26
Molasses in tank cars.
When molasses is imported in tank cars, the importer shall file with the port director a certificate showing whether there is any substantial difference either in the total sugars or the character of the molasses in the different cars.
§ 151.27
Weighing and sampling done at time of unlading.
Sugar, sirup, and molasses requiring either weighing or sampling shall be weighed or sampled at the time of unlading. When such merchandise requires both weighing and sampling, these operations shall be performed simultaneously.
§ 151.28
Gauging of sirup or molasses discharged into storage tanks.
(a)
Plans of storage tank to be filed.
When sirup or molasses is imported in bulk in tank vessels and is to be pumped or discharged into storage tanks, before the discharging is permitted there shall be filed with the port director a certified copy of the plans and gauge table of the storage tank showing all inlets and outlets and stating accurately the capacity in liters per centimeter of height of the tank from an indicated starting point.
(b)
Settling before gauging.
After the discharge is completed, all inlets to the tank shall be carefully sealed and the
sirup or molasses left undisturbed for a period not to exceed 20 days to allow for settling before being gauged. When a request for immediate gauging is made in writing by the importer, it shall be allowed by the port director.
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17470, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 80-142, 45 FR 36384, May 30, 1980; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51268, Dec. 21, 1988]

If no positive evidence is at hand as to the actual date of exportation, the Center director shall ascertain or estimate the date of exportation by all reasonable ways and means in his power, and in so doing may consider dates on bills of
lading, invoices, and other information available to him.

(a)
Identical merchandise under decision favorable to Government.
The principles of any court decision favorable to the Government shall be applied to all merchandise identical with that passed on by the court which is covered by unliquidated entries, whether for consumption or warehouse.
(b)
Similar merchandise under decision favorable to Government.
The principles of any court decision favorable to the Government shall be applied to merchandise, though not identical with the merchandise the subject of the court's decision, if its classification is affected by such principles, provided that it has been entered or withdrawn for consumption after 30 days from the date of publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin.
(c)
Higher rate.
If a court decision overruling a protest contains a definite statement that a higher rate than that assessed by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, was properly chargeable, such higher rate shall be applied to all merchandise, whether identical or similar to that passed on by the court, which is affected by the principles of the court's decision and which is entered or withdrawn for consumption after 30 days from the date of the publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin.
(d)
American manufacturer's petition upheld.
If the court upholds a petition made by an American manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler under the provisions of section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516), the principles of the court's decision shall be applicable to all merchandise of that character which is entered or withdrawn for consumption after the date of publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin. The liquidation of entries covering merchandise of that character made after publication of the court's decision shall be suspended in accordance with § 159.57 of this chapter pending any rehearing or review, then liquidated, or, if necessary, reliquidated in accordance with the final judicial decision.
(e)
Other decisions adverse to Government.

§§ 152.20-152.22
[Reserved]
§ 152.23

Merchandise imported from one country, being the growth, production, or manufacture of another country, shall for value purposes (see sections 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1401a) be treated as an exportation of the country from which it is immediately imported. However, if it appears by the invoice, bill of lading, or other evidence that the merchandise was destined for the United States at the time of original shipment, it shall be treated as an exportation of the country from which it was originally exported. The term “country” is to be regarded for the purposes of this section as embracing all the possessions of a nation, however widely separated, which are subject to the same supreme executive and legislative authority and control.
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17477, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 87-89, 52 FR 24446, July 1, 1987]

(b)
Only for merchandise under Center director's jurisdiction.
The information will be given only in regard to merchandise to be appraised by, or under the jurisdiction of, the Center director who receives the request, and only with respect to merchandise for which there is presented evidence of a firm commitment or intent to import such merchandise into the United States.
(c)
Information by importer.
Each request must be accompanied by the latest information as to the values in question which the importer has or can reasonably obtain.
(d)
Information not binding.
Value information will be given by the Center director only with an understanding and agreement in each case that the information is in no sense an appraisement and is not binding upon the Center director's action when he appraises the merchandise.
(e)
No reply required after entry.
The Center director will not be required to reply to a written request for value information after a value for the merchandise has been declared on entry unless he has information indicating a probable appraised value different from such entered value.

The value for appraisement of merchandise exported to the United States on or after July 1, 1980, or, for articles classified under subheading 6401.10.00 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), on or after July 1, 1981, will be determined in accordance with section 402, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a), as amended by section 201, Trade Agreements Act of 1979.
(b)
Methods.
Imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis, and in the order, of the following:
(1) The transaction value provided for in § 152.103;
(2) The transaction value of identical merchandise provided for in § 152.104, if the transaction value cannot be determined, or can be determined but cannot be used because of the limitations provided for in § 152.103(j);
(3) The transaction value of similar merchandise provided for in § 152.104, if the transaction value of identical merchandise cannot be determined;
(4) The deductive value provided for in § 152.105, if the transaction value of similar merchandise cannot be determined;
(5) The computed value provided for in § 152.106, if the deductive value cannot be determined; or

The request must be made at the time the entry summary for the merchandise is filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically (see § 141.0a(b) of this chapter). If the importer makes the request, but the value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined using the computed value method, the merchandise will be appraised using the deductive value method if it is possible to do so. If the deductive value cannot be determined, the appraised value will be determined as provided for in § 152.107.
(d)
Explanation to importer.
Upon receipt of a written request from the importer within 90 days after liquidation, the Center director shall provide a reasonable and concise written explanation of how the value of the imported merchandise was determined. The explanation will apply only to the imported merchandise being appraised and will not serve as authority with respect to the valuation of importations of any other merchandise at the same or a different port of entry. This procedure is for informational purposes only, and will not affect or replace the protest or administrative ruling procedures contained in parts 174 and 177, respectively, of this chapter, or any other Customs procedures. Under this procedure, Customs will not be required to release any information not otherwise subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or any other statute (see part 103 of this chapter).

(6) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, five percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization, and that organization.
(7) Two or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, any person.
(h)
Same class or kind.
“Merchandise of the same class or kind” means merchandise (including, but not limited to, identical merchandise and similar merchandise) within a group or range of merchandise produced by a particular industry or industry sector.
(i)
Similar merchandise.
“Similar merchandise” means merchandise produced in the same country and by the same person as the merchandise being appraised, like the merchandise being appraised in characteristics and component material, and commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised. If similar merchandise cannot be found (or for purposes of related buyer and seller transactions (see § 152.103 (j)(2)(i)(A)) regardless of whether similar merchandise can be found), merchandise produced in the same country as, but not produced by the same person as, the merchandise being appraised, like the merchandise being appraised in characteristics and component material, and commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised, may be treated as “similar merchandise”. “Similar merchandise” does not include merchandise that incorporates or reflects any engineering, development, artwork, design work, or plan or sketch supplied free or at reduced cost by the buyer of the merchandise for use in connection with the production or the sale for export to the United States of the merchandise, and is not an assist because undertaken within the United States.
(j)
Sufficient information.
“Sufficient information” means information that establishes the accuracy of:
(1) Any amount:
(i) Added under § 152.103(b) to the price actually paid or payable;
(ii) Deducted under § 152.105(d) as profit or general expenses or value from further processing, or
(iii) Added under § 152.106(b) as profit or general expenses; or
(2) Any difference taken into account under § 152.103(j)(2)(ii); or
(3) Any adjustment made under § 152.104(d).
(k)
Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity.
“Unit price at which merchandise is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity” means the unit price at which the “merchandise concerned” is sold to unrelated persons at the first commercial level after importation (in cases to which § 152.105(c)(1) and (2) apply), or after further processing (in cases to which § 152.105(c)(3) applies), at which the sales take place in a total volume greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price and sufficient to establish the unit price.
[T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 97-82, 62 FR 51771, Oct. 3, 1997]
§ 152.103
Transaction value.
(a)
Price actually paid or payable
—(1)
General.
In determining transaction value, the price actually paid or payable will be considered without regard to its method of derivation. It may be the result of discounts, increases, or negotiations, or may be arrived at by the application of a formula, such as the price in effect on the date of export in the London Commodity Market. The word “payable” refers to a situation in which the price has been agreed upon, but actual payment has not been made at the time of importation. Payment may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments and may be made directly or indirectly.

# Example 1.
In a transaction with foreign Company X, a U.S. firm pays Company X $10,000 for a shipment of meat products, packed ready for shipment to the United
States. No selling commission, assist, royalty, or license fee is involved. Company X is not related to the U.S. purchaser and imposes no condition or limitation on the buyer.
The customs value of the imported meat products is $10,000—the transaction value of the imported merchandise.

# Example 2.
A foreign shipper sold merchandise at $100 per unit to a U.S. importer. Subsequently, the foreign shipper increased its price to $110 per unit. The merchandise was exported after the effective date of the price increase. The invoice price of $100 was the price originally agreed upon and the price the U.S. importer actually paid for the merchandise.
How should the merchandise be appraised?
Actual transaction value of $100 per unit based on the price actually paid or payable.

# Example 3.
A foreign shipper sells to U.S. wholesalers at one price and to U.S. retailers at a higher price. The shipment undergoing appraisement is a shipment to a U.S. retailer. There are continuing shipments of identical and similar merchandise to U.S. wholesalers.
How should the merchandise be appraised?
Actual transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable by the retailer.

# Example 4.
Company X in the United States pay $2,000 to Y Toy Factory abroad for a shipment of toys. The $2,000 consists of $1,850 for the toys and $150 for ocean freight and insurance. Y Toy Factory would have charged Company X $2,200 for the toys; however, because Y owed Company X $350, Y charged only $1,850 for the toys. What is the transaction value?
The transaction value of the imported merchandise is $2,200, that is, the sum of the $1,850 plus the $350 indirect payment. Because the transaction value excludes C.I.F. charges, the $150 ocean freight and insurance charge is excluded.

# Example 5.
A seller offers merchandise at $100, less a 2% discount for cash. A buyer remits $98 cash, taking advantage of the cash discount.
The transaction value is $98, the price actually paid or payable.
(2)
Indirect payment.
An indirect payment would include the settlement by the buyer, in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, or where the buyer receives a price reduction on a current importation as a means of settling a debt owed him by the seller. Activities such as advertising, undertaken by the buyer on his own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in § 152.103(b), will not be considered an indirect payment to the seller though they may benefit the seller. The costs of those activities will not be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value of the imported merchandise.
(3)
Assembled merchandise.
The price actually paid or payable may represent an amount for the assembly of imported merchandise in which the seller has no interest other than as the assembler. The price actually paid or payable in that case will be calculated by the addition of the value of the components and required adjustments to form the basis for the transaction value.

# Example 1.
The importer previously has supplied an unrelated foreign assembler with fabricated components ready for assembly having a value or cost at the assembler's plant of $1.00 per unit. The importer pays the assembler 50¢ per unit for the assembly. The transaction value for the assembled unit is $1.50.

# Example 2.
Same facts as Example 1 above except the U.S. importer furnishes to the foreign assembler a tooling assist consisting of a tool acquired by the importer at $1,000. The transportation expenses to the foreign assembler's plant for the tooling assist equal $100. The transaction value for the assembled unit would be $1.50 per unit plus a
pro rata
share of the tooling assist valued at $1,100.
(4)
Rebate.
Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually paid or payable made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller after the date of importation of the merchandise will be disregarded in determining the transaction value under § 152.103(b).
(5)
Foreign inland freight and other inland charges incident to the international shipment of merchandise
—(i)
Ex-factory sales.
If the price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the imported merchandise does not include a charge for foreign inland freight and other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise (an ex-factory price), those charges will not be added to the price.
(ii)
Sales other than ex-factory.
As a general rule, in those situations where the price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise includes a charge for foreign inland freight, whether or not itemized separately on the invoices or other commercial documents, that charge will be part of the transaction value to the extent included in the price. However, charges
for foreign inland freight and other services incident to the shipment of the merchandise to the United States may be considered incident to the international shipment of that merchandise within the meaning of § 152.102(f) if they are identified separately and they occur after the merchandise has been sold for export to the United States and placed with a carrier for through shipment to the United States.
(iii)
Evidence of sale for export and placement for through shipment.
A sale for export and placement for through shipment to the United States under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be established by means of a through bill of lading to be presented to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. Only in those situations where it clearly would be impossible to ship merchandise on a through bill of lading (e.g., shipments via the seller's own conveyance) will other documentation satisfactory to the Center director showing a sale for export to the United States and placement for through shipment to the United States be accepted in lieu of a through bill of lading.
(iv)
Erroneous and false information.
This regulation shall not be construed as prohibiting Customs from making appropriate additions to the dutiable value of merchandise in instances where verification reveals that foreign inland freight charges or other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise have been overstated.
(b)
Additions to price actually paid or payable.
(1) The transaction value of imported merchandise is the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, plus amounts equal to:
(i) The packing costs incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;
(ii) Any selling commission incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;
(iii) The value, apportioned as appropriate, of any assist;
(iv) Any royalty or license fee related to the imported merchandise that the buyer is required to pay, directly or indirectly, as a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for exportation to the United States; and
(v) The proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrue, directly or indirectly, to the seller.
(2) The price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise will be increased by the amounts attributable to the items (and no others) described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section to the extent that each amount is not otherwise included within the price actually paid or payable, and is based on sufficient information. If sufficient information is not available, for any reason, with respect to any amount referred to in this section, the transaction value will be treated as one that cannot be determined.
(3)
Interpretative note.
A royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the United States of a gallon of a particular product imported by the pound and transformed into a solution after importation. If the royalty is based partially on the imported merchandise and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported merchandise (such as if the imported merchandise is mixed with domestic ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or if the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to make an addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is based only on the imported merchandise and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable will be made.
(c)
Sufficiency of information.
Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made only if there is sufficient information to establish the accuracy of the additions and the extent to which they are not included in the price.
(d)
Assist.
If the value of an assist is to be added to the price actually paid or payable, or to be used as a component of computed value, the Center director shall determine the value of the assist and apportion that value to the price of the imported merchandise in the following manner:
(1) If the assist consist of materials, components, parts, or similar items incorporated in the imported merchandise, or items consumed in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be the cost of its production. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production.
(2) If the assist consists of tools, dies, molds, or similar items used in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller,the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be cost of its production. If the assist has been used previously by the buyer, regardless of whether it had been acquired or produced by him, the original cost of acquisition or production would be adjusted downward to reflect its use before its value could be determined. If the assist were leased by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist would be the cost of the lease. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production. Repairs or modifications to an assist may increase its value.

# Example 1.
A U.S. importer supplied detailed designs to the foreign producer. These designs were necessary to manufacture the merchandise. The U.S. importer bought the designs from an engineering company in the U.S. for submission to his foreign supplier.
Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of the assist?
No, design work undertaken in the U.S. may not be added to the price actually paid or payable.

# Example 2.
A U.S. importer supplied molds free of charge to the foreign shipper. The molds were necessary to manufacture merchandise for the U.S. importer. The U.S. importer had some of the molds manufactured by a U.S. company and others manufactured in a third country.
Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of the molds?
Yes. It is an addition required to be made to transaction value.
(e)
Apportionment.
(1) The apportionment of the value of assists to imported merchandise will be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The method of apportionment actually accepted by Customs will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer. If the entire anticipated production using the assist is for exportation to the United States, the total value may be apportioned over (i) the first shipment, if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at once, (ii) the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment, or (iii) the entire anticipated production. In addition to these three methods, the importer may request some other method of apportionment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If the anticipated production is only partially for exportation to the United States, or if the assist is used in several countries, the method of apportionment will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer.
(2)
Interpretative note.
An importer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the imported merchandise and contracts to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. The importer may request Customs to apportion the value of the mold over 1,000, 4,000, 10,000 units, or any other figure which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(f)
Royalties or license fees.
Royalties or license fees for patents covering processes to manufacture the imported merchandise generally will be dutiable. Royalties or license fees paid to third parties for use, in the United States, of copyrights and trademarks related to the imported merchandise generally will be considered selling expenses of the buyer and not dutiable. The dutiable status of royalties or license fees paid by the buyer will be determined in each case and will depend on (1) whether the buyer was required to pay them as a condition of sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States, and (2) to whom and under what circumstances they were paid. Payments made by the buyer to a third
party for the right to distribute or resell the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported merchandise if the payments are not a condition of the sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States.

# Example.
A foreign producer sold merchandise to an unrelated U.S. importer. The U.S. importer pays a royalty to an unrelated third party for the right to manufacture and sell a product made in part from the imported merchandise. The royalty is based on the selling price of the further-manufactured product in the U.S.
Is the license fee part of the appraised value? No. The license fee is not a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for export to the U.S.
(g)
Proceeds of subsequent resale.
Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made for the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller. Dividends or other payments from the buyer to the seller which do not relate directly to the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. Whether any addition would be made will depend on the facts of the particular case.

# Example.
A buyer contracts to import a new product. Not knowing whether the product ultimately will sell in the United States, the buyer agrees to pay the seller initially $1 per unit with an additional $1 per unit to be paid upon the sale of each unit in the United States. Assuming the resale price in the United States can be determined in a reasonable period of time, the transaction value of each unit would be $2. Otherwise, the transaction value could not be determined for want of sufficient information.
(h)
Right to reproduce.
Charges for the right to reproduce the imported merchandise in the United States will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. The right to reproduce denotes that an idea or an original work is incorporated in, or reflected by, the imported merchandise, and the right is reserved to reproduce that idea or work in other merchandise by using the imported merchandise. The concept of the right to reproduce relates only to the following classes of merchandise: originals or copies of artistic or scientific works; originals or copies of models and industrial drawings; model machines and prototypes; and plant and animal species.

# Example.
The importer purchases a painting. By purchasing the painting, the owner possesses the right to resell, lease, or otherwise place it on display. Absent an agreement to the contrary, he does not possess the right to reproduce copies of the painting. Fees paid for the right to reproduce the painting would not be dutiable.
(i)
Exclusions from transaction value.
The transaction value of imported merchandise does not include any of the following, if identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from any cost or other item referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) Any reasonable cost or charge that is incurred for—
(i) The construction, erection, assembly, or maintenance of, or the technical assistance provided with respect to, the merchandise after its importation into the United States; or
(ii) The transportation of the merchandise after its importation.
(2) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the imported merchandise by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable.

# Example.
A foreign shipper sells a piece of equipment to a U.S. buyer. The total contract price for the equipment includes technical assistance in the U.S. The equipment cannot be purchased without the technical assistance, but the contract provides a breakdown of costs.
Should the appraised value include the technical assistance? No, transaction value does not include any reasonable costs for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance of, or technical assistance, for the imported merchandise after its importation into the U.S., the cost of which can be accurately identified as being separate from the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise to which they relate.
(j)
Limitations on use of transaction value
—(1)
In general.
The transaction value of imported merchandise will be the appraised value only if:
(i) There are no restrictions on the disposition or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer, other than restrictions which are imposed or required by law, limit the geographical
area in which the merchandise may be resold, or do not affect substantially the value of the merchandise;
(ii) The sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the imported merchandise is not subject to any condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined;
(iii) No part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section; and
(iv) The buyer and seller are not related, or the buyer and seller are related but the transaction value is acceptable.
(2)
Related person transactions.
(i) The transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if an examination of the circumstances of sale indicates that their relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable, or if the transaction value of the imported merchandise closely approximates:
(A) The transaction value of identical merchandise; or of similar merchandise, in sales to unrelated buyers in the United States; or
(B) The deductive value or computed value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise; and
(C) Each value referred to in paragraph (j)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section that is used for comparison relates to merchandise that was exported to the United States at or about the same time as the imported merchandise.
(ii) In applying the values used for comparison, differences with respect to the sales involved will be taken into account if based on sufficient information supplied by the buyer or otherwise available to Customs and if the differences relate to:
(A) Commercial levels;
(B) Quantity levels;
(C) The costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(D) The costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are related.
(k)
Restrictions and conditions on sale.
(1) A restriction placed on the buyer of imported merchandise that does not affect substantially its value will not prevent transaction value from being accepted as the appraised value.
(i)
Interpretative note.
A seller requires a buyer of automobiles not to sell or exhibit them before a fixed date that represents the beginning of a model year.
(2) The transaction value will not be accepted as the appraised value if the sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the merchandise is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined.
(i)
Interpretative note 1.
The seller establishes the price of the imported merchandise on condition that the buyer also will buy other merchandise in specified quantities.
(ii)
Interpretative note 2.
The price of the imported merchandise is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the merchandise sells other merchandise to the seller of the merchandise.
(iii)
Interpretative note 3.
The price of the imported merchandise is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the merchandise, such as where the merchandise is to be further processed by the buyer, and has been provided by the seller on condition that he will receive a specified quantity of the finished merchandise.
(l)
Related buyer and seller
—(1)
Validation of transaction.
The Center director shall not disregard a transaction value solely because the buyer and seller are related. There will be related person transactions in which validation of the transaction value, using the procedures contained in § 152.103(j)(2), may not be necessary.
(i)
Interpretative note 1.
Customs may have previously examined the relationship or may already have sufficient detailed information concerning the buyer and seller to be satisfied that the relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable. In such case, if Customs has no doubts about the acceptability of the price, the price will be accepted without requesting further information from the importer. If Customs does have doubts about the acceptability of the price and is unable to
accept the transaction value without further inquiry, the importer will be given an opportunity to supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable Customs to examine the circumstances of the sale. In this context, Customs will examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived at in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price.
(ii)
Interpretative note 2.
If it is shown that the buyer and seller, although related, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship, and the transaction value will be accepted. If the price has been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question, or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to him, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship.
(iii)
Interpretative note 3.
If it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is equivalent to the firm's overall profit realized over a representative period of time (e.g., on an annual basis), in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price has not been influenced.

# Example.
A foreign seller sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign seller does not sell identical merchandise or similar merchandise to any unrelated parties. The transaction between the foreign seller and the U.S. importer is determined by Customs to be unaffected by the relationship.
How should the merchandise be appraised?
Transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable. A transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if the relationship did not affect the price actually paid or payable. This is so even if similar merchandise is being sold at a higher price, which includes a higher percentage for profit and general expenses.
(2)
Test values.
(i) The importer or the buyer may demonstrate that the transaction value in a related person transaction is acceptable by showing that the value “closely approximates” any one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i). The factors that will be examined to determine if the transaction value closely approximates a test value include:
(A) The nature of the imported merchandise and the industry,
(B) The season in which the merchandise is imported,
(C) Whether the difference in value is commercially significant, and
(D) Whether the difference in value is attributable to internal transport costs in the country of exportation.
(ii) Because these factors may vary, Customs will not be able to apply a uniform standard, such as a fixed percentage, in each case. A small difference in value in a case involving one type of imported merchandise may be unacceptable, although a large difference in a case involving another type may be acceptable, in determining if the transaction value closely approximates any of the test values. Customs will be consistent in determining if one value “closely approximates” another value. The same approach will be taken if Customs considers a transaction value that is higher than any of the enumerated test values as will be taken if the transaction value is lower than any of the test values.

# Example.
In applying any of the test values, if the transaction value in the sale under consideration is rejected because 95 does not closely approximate 100, then a transaction value for the sale of the same merchandise at 105 occurring at or about the same time likewise would have to be rejected. Similarly, if 103 were considered to closely approximate 100, a transaction value of 97 likewise would closely approximate 100.
(iii) If one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i) has been found to be appropriate, the Center director shall not seek to determine if the relationship between the buyer and seller influenced the price. If the Center director already has sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the test values is appropriate, he shall not require the importer to demonstrate that the test value is appropriate.
(m)
Rejection of transaction value.
When CBP has grounds for rejecting the transaction value declared by an importer and that rejection increases the duty liability, the Center director
shall inform the importer of the grounds for the rejection. The importer will be afforded 20 days to respond in writing to the Center director if in disagreement. This procedure will not affect or replace the administrative ruling procedures contained in part 177 of this chapter, or any other CBP procedures.
[T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 84-235, 49 FR 46888, Nov. 29, 1984; CBP Dec. No. 168-26, 81 FR 93023, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 152.104
Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise.
(a)
General.
The transaction value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise, is the transaction value (acceptable as the appraised value under § 152.103 but adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section) of imported merchandise that is—
(1) With respect to the merchandise being appraised, either identical merchandise, or similar merchandise; and
(2) Exported to the United States at or about the time that the merchandise being appraised is exported to the United States.
(b)
Identical merchandise.
Minor differences in appearance will not preclude otherwise conforming merchandise from being considered “identical”. See § 152.102(d).
(c)
Similar merchandise.
The quality of the merchandise, its reputation, and the existence of a trademark will be factors considered to determine whether merchandise is “similar”. See § 152.102(i).
(d)
Commercial level and quantity.
Transaction values determined under this section will be based on sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the sales of the merchandise being appraised. If no such sale is found, sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at either a different commercial level or in different quantities, or both, will be used, but adjusted to take account of that difference. Any adjustment made under this section will be based on “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j). If in applying this section to any merchandise, two or more transaction values for identical merchandise, or for similar merchandise, are determined, the merchandise will be appraised on the basis of the lower or lowest of those values.
(e)
Adjustments.
(1) Adjustments for identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, because of different commercial levels or quantities, or both, whether leading to an increase or decrease in the value, will be made only on the basis of sufficient information; e.g., valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or quantities.
(2)
Interpretative note.
If the imported merchandise being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical imported merchandise for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being
bona fide
through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the provisions for transaction value of identical or similar merchandise is not appropriate.
§ 152.105
Deductive value.
(a)
Merchandise concerned.
For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise concerned” means the merchandise being appraised, identical merchandise, or similar merchandise.
(b)
Merchandise of the same class or kind.
For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise of the same class or kind” includes merchandise imported from the same country as well as other countries as the merchandise being appraised.
(c)
Prices.
The deductive value of the merchandise being appraised is whichever of the following prices (as adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section) is appropriate depending upon when and in what condition the merchandise concerned is sold in the United States:
(1) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity at or about such date.
(2) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported but not sold at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised but before the close of the 90th day after the date of such importation.
(3) If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th day after the date of such importation. This provision will apply to appraisement of merchandise only if the importer so elects at the time of filing the entry summary.
(d)
Deductions from price.
The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to:
(1) Any commission usually paid or agreed to be paid, or the addition usually made for profit and general expenses, in connection with sales in the United States of imported merchandise that is of the same class or kind, regardless of the country of exportation, as the merchandise concerned;
(2) The actual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to international shipments of the merchandise concerned from the country of exportation to the United States;
(3) The usual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to shipments of the merchandise concerned from the place of importation to the place of delivery in the United States, if those costs are not included as a general expense under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
(4) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the merchandise concerned by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable; and
(5) But only in the case of price determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the value added by the processing of the merchandise after importation to the extent that the value is based on sufficient information relating to the cost of that processing.
(e)
Profit and general expenses; special rules.
(1) The deduction made for profit and general expenses (taken as a whole) will be based upon the importer's profit and general expenses, unless the profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind from all countries, in which case the deduction will be based on the usual profit and general expenses reflected in those sales, as determined from sufficient information. Any State or local tax imposed on the importer with respect to the sale of imported merchandise will be treated as a general expense.
(2) In determining deductions for commissions and usual profit and general expenses, sales in the United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, including the merchandise being appraised, for which sufficient information can be provided, will be examined.
(f)
Packing costs.
The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be increased, but only to the extent that the costs are not otherwise included, by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by the importer or the buyer with respect to the merchandise concerned.
(g)
Assists.
For purposes of determining deductive value, any sale to a person who supplies any assist for use in connection with the production or sale for export of the merchandise concerned will be disregarded.
(h)
Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity.
The unit price will be established after a sufficient number of units have been sold to an unrelated person. The unit price to be used when the units have been sold in different quantities will be that at which the total volume sold is greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price.
(1)
Interpretative note 1.
Merchandise is sold to an unrelated person from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities:
Sale quantity
Unit price
Number of sales
Total quantity sold at each price
1-10 units
$100
10 sales of 5 units
65
5 sales of 3 units
11-25 units
95
5 sales of 11 units
55
Over 25 units
90
1 sale of 30 units
80
1 sale of 50 units
The greatest number of units sold at a price is 80; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $90.
(2)
Interpretative note 2.
Two sales to unrelated persons occur: in the first sale, 500 units are sold at a price of $95 each; in the second sale, 400 units are sold at a price of $90 each. In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $95.
(3)
Interpretative note 3.
Various quantities are sold to unrelated persons at various prices:
(
i

In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 65; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $90.
(i)
Further processing
—(1)
Quantified data.
If merchandise has undergone further processing after its importation into the United States and the importer elects the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, deductions made for the value added by that processing will be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the cost of the work performed. Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of construction, and other industry practices would form the basis for the deduction. That deduction also will reflect amounts for spoilage, waste, or scrap derived from the further processing.
(2)
Loss of identity.
If the imported merchandise loses its identity as a result of further processing, the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be applicable unless the value added by the processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable difficulty for either importers or Customs. If the imported merchandise maintains its identity but forms a minor element of the merchandise sold in the United States, the use of paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be unjustified. The Center director shall review each case involving these issues on its merits.

# Example.
A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated person. The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production. The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and the type of processing involved can be accurately costed.
How should the merchandise be appraised?
The merchandise should be appraised under deductive value with allowances for profit and general expenses, freight and insurance, duties and taxes, and the cost of processing.
[T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 85-123, 50 FR 29956, July 23, 1985]
§ 152.106
Computed value.
(a)
Elements.
The computed value of imported merchandise is the sum of:
(1) The cost or value of the materials and the fabrication and other processing of any kind employed in the production of the imported merchandise;
(2) An amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by the producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States;
(3) Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section; and
(4) The packing costs.
(b)
Special rules.
(1) The cost or value of materials under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not include the amount of any internal tax imposed by the country of exportation that is directly applicable to the materials or their disposition if the tax is remitted or refunded upon the exportation of the merchandise in the production of which the materials were used.
(2) The amount for profit and general expenses under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based upon the producer's profit and general expenses, unless the producer's profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States. In that case, the amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based on the usual profit and general expenses of such producers in those sales, as determined from “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j).
(c)
Profit and general expenses.
The amount for profit and general expenses will be taken as a whole. If the producer's profit figure is low and general expenses high, those figures taken together nevertheless may be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of imported merchandise of the same class or kind.
(1)
Interpretative note 1.
A product is introduced into the United States, and the producer accepts either no profit or a low profit to offset the high general expenses required to introduce the product into this market. If the producer can demonstrate that there is a low profit on sales of the imported merchandise because of peculiar commercial circumstances, the actual profit figures will be accepted provided the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and his pricing policy reflects the usual pricing policies in the industry.
(2)
Interpretative note 2.
Producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforseeable drop in demand, or they sell merchandise to complement a range of merchandise being produced in the United States and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. If the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the merchandise being valued which are made in the country of exportation for export to the United States, the amount for profit and general expenses will be based upon reliable and quantifiable information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the merchandise.
(d)
Assists and packing costs.
Computed value also will include an amount equal to the apportioned value of any assists used in the production of the imported merchandise and the packing costs for the imported merchandise. The value of any engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in the United States will be included in computed value only to the extent that their value has been charged to the producer. Depending on the producer's method of accounting, the value of assists may be included (duplicated) in the producer's cost of materials, fabrication, and other processing, or in the general expenses. If duplication occurs, a separate amount for the value of the assists will not be added to the other elements as it is not intended that any component of computed value be included twice.
(e)
Merchandise of same class or kind.
Sales for export to the United States of
the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise, including the merchandise being appraised, will be examined to determine usual profit and general expenses. For the purpose of computed value, merchandise of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the merchandise being appraised.

# Example.
A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated persons. The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production. The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and the type of processing involved can be accurately costed. The U.S. importer has requested that the shipment be appraised under computed value. The profit and general expenses figure for the same class or kind of merchandise in the country of exportation for export to the U.S. is known.
How should the merchandise be appraised?
The merchandise should be appraised under computed value, using the company's profit and general expenses if not inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind.
(f)
Availability of information.
(1) It will be presumed that the computed value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined if:
(i) The importer is unable to provide required computed value information within a reasonable time, and/or
(ii) The foreign producer refuses to provide, or is legally prevented from providing, that information.
(2) If information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer is used to determine computed value, the Center director shall inform the importer, upon written request, of:
(i) The source of the information,
(ii) The data used, and
(iii) The calculation based upon the specified data,
if not contrary to domestic law regarding disclosure of information. See also § 152.101(d).
§ 152.107
Value if other values cannot be determined or used.
(a)
Reasonable adjustments.
If the value of imported merchandise cannot be determined or otherwise used for the purposes of this subpart, the imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis of a value derived from the methods set forth in §§ 152.103 through 152.106, reasonably adjusted to the extent necessary to arrive at a value. Only information available in the United States will be used.
(b)
Identical merchandise or similar merchandise.
The requirement that identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, should be exported at or about the same time of exportation as the merchandise being appraised may be interpreted flexibly. Identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, produced in any country other than the country of exportation or production of the merchandise being appraised may be the basis for customs valuation. Customs values of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, already determined on the basis of deductive value or computed value may be used.
(c)
Deductive value.
The “90 days” requirement for the sale of merchandise referred to in § 152.105(c) may be administered flexibly.
§ 152.108
Unacceptable bases of appraisement.
For the purposes of this subpart, imported merchandise may not be appraised on the basis of:
(a) The selling price in the United States of merchandise produced in the United States;
(b) A system that provides for the appraisement of imported merchandise at the higher of two alternative values;
(c) The price of merchandise in the domestic market of the country of exportation;
(d) A cost of production, other than a value determined under § 152.106 for merchandise that is identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, to the merchandise being appraised;
(e) The price of merchandise for export to a country other than the United States;
(f) Minimum values for appraisement;
(g) Arbitrary or fictitious values.

§ 158.0
Scope.
This part sets forth general rules for granting relief from duties on merchandise which is lost, damaged, abandoned, or exported.

# Subpart A—Lost or Missing Packages and Deficiencies in Contents of Packages
§ 158.1
Definition of “permitted” merchandise.
For the purpose of this subpart, merchandise is “permitted” when Customs authorizes the carrier bringing the shipment to the port to make delivery to the consignee or the next carrier and:
(a) These parties in interest, or their agents, make a joint determination of the quantities being delivered, or,
(b) The carrier bringing the shipment to the port, at its option, independently declares the quantities available for delivery by filing with the port director, no later than the close of business on the next working day after a determination of quantities is made, a signed statement that:
(1) An independent determination of quantities of merchandise available for delivery has been made, with the date of the determination shown;
(2) At least 4 days have elapsed since the consignee or his agent was notified that Customs has authorized delivery; and,
(3) The merchandise was and is available for delivery.
§ 158.2
Shortages in packages released under immediate delivery or entry.
An importer may file an entry summary for consumption or an entry summary for warehouse for less than the invoiced and manifested number of
packages in a shipment “permitted” and delivered to him or deposited in a bonded warehouse under the immediate delivery procedure in § 142.21 of this chapter, or under the entry documentation in § 142.3(a), if he files with the entry summary a Customs Form 5931 in triplicate. The Customs Form 5931 shall be completed by the importer with attached copies of the dock receipt or other documents evidencing nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.
[T.D. 85-159, 50 FR 38520, Sept. 23, 1985]
§ 158.3
Allowance for lost or missing packages included in an entry summary.
Allowance shall be made in the assessment of duties for lost or missing packages of merchandise included in an entry summary whenever it is established to the satisfaction of the Center director before the liquidation of the entry summary becomes final that the merchandise claimed to be lost or missing was not “permitted.” A claim for such allowance shall be made on Customs Form 5931, in triplicate, executed by the importer and the importing carrier or bonded carrier, as appropriate. When the importing or bonded carrier refuses to execute the Customs Form 5931, a claim may be allowed if the importer properly executes the Customs Form 5931 and attaches copies of the dock receipt or other document evidencing nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.
[T.D. 72-258, 37 FR 20171, Sept. 27, 1972, as amended by T.D. 79-221, 44 FR 46829, Aug. 9, 1979; CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93023, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 158.4
Liability of carrier for lost or missing packages.
Upon a joint determination or independent determination of quantity as set forth in § 158.1 (a) or (b) resulting in the merchandise being “permitted,” the carrier shall be responsible only for any discrepancy between the manifested quantity and the “permitted” quantity. In the case of an importing carrier, when there is a difference between the quantity shown on the inward foreign manifest and the quantity “permitted,” liquidated damages or duties shall be assessed under the provisions of the carrier's bond or under the provisions of section 448, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448), unless the carrier corrects his manifest (see § 4.12 of this chapter). In the case of a bonded carrier, liquidated damages for lost or missing merchandise shall be assessed in accordance with § 18.8 of this chapter.
§ 158.5
Deficiencies in contents of packages—general.
An allowance shall be made in the assessment of duties for deficiencies in the contents of packages when, before the liquidation of the entry becomes final, the importer files:
(a) In the case of a concealed shortage, a Customs Form 5931, in triplicate, executed by the importer alone, and the Center director is satisfied as to the validity of the claim; or,
(b) In the case of an unconcealed shortage, a Customs Form 5931, in triplicate, executed by both the importer and the importing or bonded carrier, as appropriate.
[T.D. 72-258, 37 FR 20171, Sept. 27, 1972, as amended by CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93023, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 158.6
Deficiencies in contents of examination packages.
Allowance for deficiency in the contents of any examination package reported to the port director by a Customs officer shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. No Customs officer except one making an examination contemplated by section 499, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1499), shall report a supposed deficiency to the port director unless it is established to the satisfaction of the reporting officer that the merchandise was not imported.
(Sec. 499, 46 Stat. 728, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1499)
§ 158.7
Allowance for reduction or loss of merchandise by a natural force or by leakage.
Merchandise subject to ad valorem, specific, or compound rates of duty found at the time of importation to be reduced or diminished by a natural force, such as evaporation, or by leakage, shall be appraised in its condition as imported, with an allowance made
in the value, weight, quantity, or measure to the extent of the reduction or loss, except when forbidden by law or regulation.
(R.S. 251, as amended, sec. 499, sec. 624, 46 Stat. 728, as amended, 759 (19 U.S.C. 66, 1499, 1624))
[T.D. 78-448, 43 FR 53713, Nov. 17, 1978]

# Subpart B—Damaged or Defective Merchandise
§ 158.11
Merchandise completely worthless at time of importation.
(a)
Nonperishable merchandise.
When a shipment of nonperishable merchandise, or any portion thereof which shall have been segregated from the remainder of the shipment under Customs supervision at the expense of the importer, is found by the port director to be entirely without commercial value at the time of importation by reason of damage or deterioration, an allowance in duties on such merchandise on the ground of nonimportation shall be made in the liquidation of the entry.
(b)
Perishable merchandise.
In the case of perishable merchandise, an allowance in duties may be made under the following conditions:
(1) An application for such allowance shall be filed with the port director on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent, in duplicate, within 96 hours after the unlading of the merchandise and before any of the shipment involved has been removed from the pier (or other area permitted under § 142.2(b)(2) of this chapter) pursuant to the entry permit.
(2) Should an application filed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section be withdrawn, the merchandise involved shall thereafter be released upon presentation of an appropriate permit.
(3) Allowance in duty shall be made in the liquidation of the entry on such of the merchandise covered by the application as is found by the port director to be entirely without commercial value by reason of damage or deterioration.
(Sec. 506, 46 Stat. 732, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1506)
[T.D. 72-258, 37 FR 20171, Sept. 27, 1972, as amended by T.D. 76-220, 41 FR 33248, Aug. 9, 1976; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 158.12
Merchandise partially damaged at time of importation.
(a)
Allowance in value.
Merchandise which is subject to ad valorem or compound duties and found by the port director to be partially damaged at the time of importation shall be appraised in its condition as imported, with an allowance made in the value to the extent of the damage. However, no allowance shall be made when forbidden by law or regulation; for example, Chapter 72, Additional U.S. Note 3, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), provides that no allowance or reduction of duties for partial damage or loss in consequence of discoloration or rust occurring before importation shall be made upon iron or steel or upon any article of iron or steel.
(b)
No allowance in specific duties.
In the case of merchandise subject to specific or compound duties and found to be partially damaged at the time of importation, no allowance may be made in the specific duties or in the weight, quantity, or measure (except that an allowance for any excessive moisture or other impurities may be made in accordance with § 158.13). However, any part of the shipment which is totally worthless and can be segregated from the rest of the shipment may be treated as a nonimportation in accordance with § 158.11.
(Sec. 506, 46 Stat. 732, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1506)
[T.D. 72-258, 37 FR 20171, Sept. 27, 1972, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51270, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 158.13
Allowance for moisture and impurities.
(a)
Application by importer
—(1)
Petroleum and petroleum products.
An application for an allowance in duties under section 507, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1507), for all detectable moisture and impurities present in
or upon imported petroleum or petroleum products shall be made by the importer on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent. The application shall be filed with the port director within 10 days of the port director's receipt of the gauging report or within 10 days of Customs acceptance of the entry's invoice gauge.
(2)
Other products.
An application for an allowance in duties under 19 U.S.C. 1507 for products other than petroleum or petroleum products for excessive moisture or other impurities not usually found in or upon such or similar merchandise shall be made by the importer on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent. The application shall be filed with the port director within 10 days after the report of weight or gauge has been received by the port director or within 10 days after the date upon which the entry or a related document was endorsed to show that invoice weight or gauge has been accepted by the Customs inspector or other Customs officer.
(b)
Allowance by Center director.
If the port director is satisfied after any necessary investigation that the merchandise contains moisture or impurities as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Center director will make allowance for the amount thereof in the liquidation of the entry.
[T.D. 90-78, 55 FR 40167, Oct. 2, 1990, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93023, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 158.14
Perishable merchandise condemned.
(a)
Application by importer.
When fruit or other perishable merchandise has been condemned by health officers or other legally constituted authorities within 10 days after landing, an importer who desires allowance in duties under section 506(2), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1506(2)), shall within 5 days after such condemnation file with the port director written notice of the condemnation. The date of landing in the case of merchandise forwarded under an entry for immediate transportation is the date of arrival at the port of destination.
(b)
Allowance in duties.
If the port director is satisfied after any necessary investigation that the claim is valid, allowance in duties shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. Such allowance shall be limited to perishable goods condemned by the health officers or authorities in the original package, unless segregation of the merchandise was under constant Customs supervision at the importer's expense.
(Sec. 506(2), 46 Stat. 732, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1506(2))

# Subpart C—Casualty, Loss, or Theft While in Customs Custody
§ 158.21
Allowance in duties for casualty, loss, or theft while in Customs custody.
Section 563(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1563(a)), provides for allowance in duties upon satisfactory proof of the loss or theft of any merchandise while in the public stores, or of the actual injury or destruction, in whole or in part, of any merchandise by accidental fire or other casualty, while in bonded warehouse, or in the public stores, or while in transportation under bond, or while in Customs custody although not in bond, or while within the limits of any port of entry and before having been landed under Customs supervision. Such allowance is subject to the conditions set forth in this subpart.
§ 158.21a
Time period.
An abatement or refund of duties shall be made in the case of injury to, or destruction of, merchandise in a bonded warehouse as a result of accidental fire or other casualty only if the fire or casualty occurs within 3 years from the date of importation.
[T.D. 79-221, 44 FR 46829, Aug. 9, 1979]
§ 158.22
Not applicable when allowances made under other provisions.
The procedures in this subpart do not apply in cases where allowances in duties are made under subpart A or subpart B of this part, or § 18.6 of this chapter.
§ 158.23
Filing of application and evidence by importer.
Within 30 days from the date of his discovery of the loss, theft, injury, or
destruction, the importer shall file an application in duplicate on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent and within 90 days from the date of discovery shall file any evidence required by § 158.26 or § 158.27.
[ T.D. 72-258, 37 FR 20171, Sept. 27, 1972, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 158.24
Place of filing.
The application and evidence shall be filed with the director of the port where the loss, theft, injury, or destruction occurred. In the case of total loss of merchandise by fire or other casualty while in transportation under bond, the application and evidence shall be filed with the director of the port at which the transportation entry was made. In the case of partial destruction of or injury to such merchandise, the application and evidence shall be filed with the director of the port of destination, except that if the merchandise is returned to the port at which the transportation entry was made, the application shall be filed at that port.
§ 158.25
Partial destruction or injury.
In the case of partial destruction or injury, no application shall be entertained unless the port director shall have had an opportunity to examine the merchandise or the remainder thereof for the purpose of fixing the percentage of injury or destruction. Whether the duty involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound, the percentage of injury for the purpose of the allowance shall be determined by comparing the market value of comparable sound merchandise with the net salvage value of the injured merchandise computed on the basis of the market value of comparable injured merchandise, such comparison to be made as of the time and place of examination.

(a) A declaration of each cartman, lighterman, or other carrier handling the package between the public stores and the place of delivery, setting forth the condition of the package at the time of receipt and delivery by him and whether or not there was an abstraction of the merchandise while the package was in his possession.
(b) A declaration of the person who first received the package for the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee as to whether or not he examined the package at the time of receipt, and, if so, as to its condition at that time.
(c) A declaration of the person who opened the package after release from Customs custody that the alleged missing merchandise was not found by him in the package or elsewhere.
§ 158.27
Accidental fire or other casualty.
In the case of injury or destruction by accidental fire or other casualty, the following evidence shall be submitted:
(a) A declaration of the master of the vessel, the conductor or driver of the vehicle, the proprietor of the warehouse, or other person (except a Customs officer) having charge of the merchandise at the time of casualty, stating:
(1) The time, place, and nature of such casualty;
(2) That the merchandise was on board the vessel or vehicle, in the warehouse, or otherwise in his charge, as the case may be, at the time of the casualty; and
(3) That it was totally destroyed and there is no probability of recovering or saving any part thereof, or that it was injured as the result of the casualty.
(b) The bill of lading, the entry summary (where appropriate) and the invoice covering the merchandise, or certified copies of the foregoing, unless such documents are already in the possession of the director of the port where the claim is filed.

The sum so advanced shall be placed in a special deposit account and expended to cover the cost of destruction or to meet any deficit should the merchandise be sold and the proceeds of sale be less than the expenses of such sale. After meeting such expenses or deficit, any balance remaining shall be refunded to the importer.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 159.1
Definition of liquidation.
Liquidation
means the final computation or ascertainment of duties on entries for consumption or drawback entries.
[T.D. 01-24, 66 FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001, as amended by CBP Dec. 11-02, 76 FR 2576, Jan. 14, 2011]
§ 159.2
Liquidation required.
All entries covering imported merchandise, except temporary importation bond entries and those for transportation in bond or for immediate exportation, shall be liquidated. Vessel repair entries are not subject to liquidation under this part (see § 4.14(i)(3) of this chapter).
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17482, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 01-24, 66 FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001]
§ 159.3
Rounding of fractions.
(a)
Value.
In the computation of duty on entries, ad valorem rates shall be applied to the values in even dollars, fractional parts of a dollar less than 50 cents being disregarded and 50 cents or more being considered as $1, with all merchandise in the same invoice subject to the same rate of duty to be treated as a unit. However, the total dutiable value of the invoice shall not be increased or decreased by more than the rounding of the total dutiable value to an even dollar. When necessary, fractional parts of a dollar, whether more or less than 50 cents, shall be dropped or taken up as whole dollars in order to avoid such an increase or decrease. If in such cases it is necessary to drop fractional parts of a dollar amounting to 50 cents or more, the lower fractions shall be dropped, and if it is necessary to take up as whole dollars fractional parts less than 50 cents, the larger fractions shall be taken. In the case of two equal fractions, the one subject to the lower rate of duty shall be dropped or taken up, as the case may be. In determining a rate of duty dependent upon value, fractional parts of a dollar shall be considered.
(b)
Quantities subject to specific duty.
Except in the case of alcoholic beverages treated under § 159.4, if a rate of duty is specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if less than one-half, shall be disregarded, and if one-half or more shall be treated as a whole unit. Subject to the same exception, if a specific rate is more than $1 per unit, duty shall be assessed upon the exact quantity with any fractional part expressed in the form of a decimal extended to two places.
§ 159.4
Alcoholic beverages.
(a)
Quantities subject to duties.
Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes shall be collected only on the number of proof gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption. No internal revenue tax shall be collected on distilled spirits in bulk which have been transferred to Internal Revenue bonded premises in accordance with § 141.102(b) of this chapter. Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages other than subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.90, HTSUS, and distilled spirits provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, shall be collected only on the number of wine gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption.
(b)
Computation of duties.
In the computation of Customs duties on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208 (19 U.S.C. 1202), which are also subject to internal revenue taxes, the methods prescribed for the computation of internal revenue taxes on such beverages shall be followed. The following methods apply to the specific beverages shown:
(1)
Distilled spirits.
The quantity of distilled spirits imported in barrels, kegs, or similar containers shall be ascertained in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Where distilled spirits are imported in bottles, jugs, or similar containers, Customs duties and taxes shall be collected on the exact quantity contained in each case or other outer container, fractional parts of a gallon being carried out to three decimal places utilizing the proof gallon method of computation.
(2)
Wine.
Customs duties and taxes on wines shall be on the basis of a wine gallon of liquid measure equivalent to 231 cubic inches and shall be paid proportionally on all fractional parts of a wine gallon. Fractions of less than one-tenth gallon shall be converted to the nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon shall be converted to the next full one-tenth gallon.
(3)
Beer and similar fermented beverages.
Customs duties and taxes on beer, ale, porter, stout, and other similar fermented beverages, including sake, of any name or description containing one-half of 1 percent or more of alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor, shall be collected in accordance with section 5051(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5051(a)).
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17482, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 78-329, 43 FR 43455, Sept. 26, 1978; T.D. 80-271, 45 FR 75641, Nov. 17, 1980; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51270, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 159.5
Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes.
The internal revenue taxes imposed on cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes under section 5701 or 7652, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5701 or 7652), are determined in accordance with section 5703 of that Code (26 U.S.C. 5703) at the time of removal; that is, on the quantity removed from Customs custody under the entry or withdrawal for consumption. The Customs duties, unlike those on alcoholic beverages, do not necessarily apply only to such quantities.
§ 159.6
Difference between liquidated duties and estimated duties.
(a)
Difference under $20 in original liquidation.
When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of any entry (other than an informal, mail, or baggage entry) and the total amount of estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, including any supplemental deposit, the difference will be disregarded and the entry endorsed “as
entered.” In the case of an informal, mail, or baggage entry, the amount of duties, fees, and taxes computed by a CBP officer when the entry is prepared by, or filed with, him will be considered the liquidated assessment.
(b)
Difference under $20 in reliquidation.
When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest found due in the reliquidation of any entry and the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the prior liquidation of the entry, the difference will be disregarded except in the following cases:
(1)
Reliquidation at importer's request.
When reliquidation of any entry is made at the importer's request, such as reliquidation following the allowance of a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), or, for entries made before December 18, 2004, a request for correction under section 520(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)), any refund determined to be due will be refunded even if less than $20.
(2)
Court decision.
Any refund or increase determined to be due as the result of the reliquidation of an entry in accordance with a court decision and judgment order will be refunded or collected as the case may be.
(c)
Difference of $20 or more collected or refunded.
If there is a difference of $20 or more between the duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of an entry and the total estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, or between the total duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the reliquidation of an entry and those assessed in the prior liquidation, the entry will be endorsed to show the difference and bills or refund checks will be issued.
(d)
Customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes and interest netted for $20 limit.
The assessments of customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes and interest will be separately stated on the entry at the time of liquidation, but the amounts of any differences will be netted when applying the $20 minimum for issuance of a bill or refund check.
[T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17482, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 78-394, 43 FR 49791, Oct. 25, 1978; T.D. 94-51, 59 FR 30296, June 13, 1994; 64 FR 56440, Oct. 20, 1999; CBP Dec. 11-02, 76 FR 2576, Jan. 14, 2011]
§ 159.7
Rewarehouse entries.
The liquidation of the original warehouse entry shall be followed in determining the liability for duties on a rewarehouse entry, except in the following cases:
(a)
Merchandise excluded from liquidation of original warehouse entry.
When any of the following types of merchandise are withdrawn from warehouse for transportation to another port, they will be excluded from the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, and the liability for duties will be determined by a liquidation of the rewarehouse entry made at the port where the merchandise is withdrawn for consumption or for exportation:
(1) Alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2203 through 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes;
(2) Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes subject to internal revenue taxes;
(3) Tariff-rate quota merchandise; and
(4) Wool or hair subject to duty at a rate per clean kilogram under Chapter 51, HTSUS.
(b)
Reliquidation required by change in rate.
When a rate of customs duty or tax is changed by an act of Congress or a proclamation of the President, any necessary reliquidation of customs duty or tax on merchandise covered by a rewarehouse entry which may be required by reason of the change in rate will be made by the Center director on the effective date of the change.
(c)
Shortage, irregular delivery, nondelivery, and other cases.
In cases involving shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery under the original warehouse withdrawal for transportation, or in other cases when the Center director is of the opinion that circumstances make it inadvisable to follow the liquidation of the original
warehouse entry, he will make an appropriate adjustment in the amount of duties to be assessed under the rewarehouse entry.

Information needed by CBP for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not available, or
(ii)
Importer's request.
The importer requests an extension in writing before the statutory period expires and shows good cause why the extension should be granted. “Good cause” is demonstrated when the importer satisfies the Center director that more time is needed to present to CBP information which will affect the pending action, or there is a similar question under review by CBP.
(2)
Suspension.
The 1-year liquidation period may be suspended as required by statute or court order.
(b)
Notice of extension.
If the Center director extends the time for liquidation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the official notice of extension and reasons therefor will be posted on
www.cbp.gov.
The notice of extension will be maintained on

(d)
Additional extensions
—(1)
Information needed by CBP.
If an extension has been granted because CBP needs more information and the Center director thereafter determines that more time is needed, he may extend the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year provided he issues the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section before termination of the prior extension period.
(2)
At importer's request.
If the statutory period has been extended for one year at the importer's request, and the importer thereafter determines that additional time is necessary, it may request another extension in writing before the original extension expires, giving reasons for its request.

www.cbp.gov,
and CBP will provide courtesy notice of the extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.
(e)
Limitation on extensions.
The total time for which extensions may be granted by the Center director may not exceed 3 years.
(f)
Time limitation.

Manipulation in warehouse.
If any merchandise covered by a warehouse entry has been cleaned, sorted, repacked, or otherwise changed in condition under section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1562), withdrawals shall be passed and the entry liquidated on the basis of the weight, gauge, or measure of such merchandise in its manipulated condition with an appropriate notation in the duty statement that the duties are assessed on the basis of the manipulated condition of the merchandise.

Duties on certain alcoholic beverages are assessed only on the quantities entered or withdrawn for consumption (see § 159.4).
(c)
Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes.

Net weights and tares.
(a)
Determination of net weight.
The net weight of merchandise dutiable by net weight, or upon a value dependent upon net weight, shall be determined insofar as possible by obtaining the actual weight, or by deducting the actual or schedule tare from the gross weight. Actual tare may be determined on the basis of tests when the tares of the packages in a shipment are reasonably uniform.
(b)
Invoice net weight or tare.
When the actual net weight or tare cannot reasonably be determined and no schedule tare is applicable, liquidation may be made on the basis of the invoice net weight or tare.
(c)
Schedule tare.
The following tares, which, from experience, have proved to be the average for certain classes of merchandise shall be known as schedule tares and shall be applied, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section:
Apple boxes. 2.984 kilograms per box. This schedule tare includes the paper wrappers, if any, on the apples.
China clay in so-called half-ton casks: 26.856 kilograms per cask.

Ocher, in oil, in casks: Twelve percent of the gross weight.
Pimientos in tins imported from Spain: The following schedule drained weight shall be used as the Customs dutiable weight in the liquidation of entries, the difference between the weight of the new contents of pimientos in tins and such drained weight being the allowance made in liquidation for tare for water:
Size can
Drained weight
3 kilo
13.6 kilograms-case of 6 tins.
794 grams
16.7 kilograms-case of 24 tins.
425 grams
8.0 kilograms-case of 24 tins.

(d)
Actual tare.
In the following circumstances, the actual tare shall be ascertained and in so doing the weigher shall empty and weigh as many casks, boxes, and other coverings as he may deem necessary:
(1) If the importer is not satisfied with the invoice tare or with the schedule tare;
(2) If the Center director is of the opinion that the invoice or schedule tare does not correctly represent the tare of the merchandise; or
(3) If the weigher has reason to believe that the invoice or schedule tare is greater than the real tare.
(e)
Estimated tare.
When it is impracticable to ascertain the actual tare, the weigher shall state in his report what, in his judgment, constitutes a fair tare allowance.
(f)
Weight for value purposes.
In determining the total dutiable value of merchandise which is subject to ad valorem duty and appraised on the basis of weight, liquidation shall be made on the same basis as appraisement. For example, if appraisement is made on the basis of gross weight, the unit value shall be multiplied by the total gross weight in computing the total value even though net weight may be used for other purposes in liquidation, such as in determining total specific duties.

rates will be published in the Customs Bulletin.
(b)
Laws of country of exportation followed.
When multiple rates have been certified for a foreign currency, the rate to be used for Customs purposes shall be the type of certified rate which the Center director is satisfied, from information in his own files, information obtained and presented to him by the importer, or information obtained from other sources, is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to the particular class of merchandise on the date of exportation. In cases where two or more types of certified rates are uniformly applicable on a percentage bases, each type of certified rate shall be used for the percentage of value to which it is applicable. The percentages used shall be those which reflect realistically the percentage for which each type of rate is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation on the date of exportation.
(c)
Procedure when multiple certified rates not uniformly applicable.
If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates which would otherwise be applicable under paragraph (b) of this section were not required or permitted, as the case may be, under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to be used uniformly during any period in connection with the payment for all merchandise of the class involved, he shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during the period involved, until instructions are received from the Commissioner of Customs.

(c)
Resumption of certification.
When certification is resumed by the Federal Reserve Bank, the procedures in § 159.36 shall apply.
§ 159.38

# Subpart F—Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset

# Source:
T.D. 01-68, 66 FR 48552, Sept. 21, 2001, unless otherwise noted.
§ 159.61
General.
(a)
Continued dumping and subsidy offset.
Under section 754 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 106-387, 114 Stat. 1549 (19 U.S.C. 1675c), known as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, assessed duties received on or after October 1, 2000 under a countervailing duty order, an antidumping duty order, or a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, will be distributed, as provided under this subpart, to affected domestic producers for certain qualifying expenditures that these affected domestic producers incur after the issuance of such an antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order. This distribution is called the continued dumping and subsidy offset.
(b)
Affected domestic producer
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an “affected domestic producer” under paragraph (a) of this section means any manufacturer, producer, farmer, rancher or worker representative (including any association of such persons) that remains in operation continuing to produce the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, and that was a petitioner or an interested party that supported a petition concerning an antidumping duty order, a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, or a countervailing duty order that was entered. It is the responsibility of the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to ascertain and timely forward to Customs a list of the domestic producers potentially considered “affected domestic producers” eligible to receive a distribution in connection with each order or finding. In addition to the potential “affected domestic producers” set forth on the USITC list, the following parties also are potential “affected domestic producers”:
(i)
Successor company.
In the case of a company that has succeeded to the operations of a predecessor company that appeared on the USITC list, the successor company may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer on behalf of the predecessor company. In its certification, the company must name the predecessor company to which it has succeeded and it must describe in detail the duly authorized succession by which it is entitled to file the certification.
(ii)
A member company of an association.
A member company of an association appearing on the USITC list for an order or finding may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer, even though the member company does not itself appear on the USITC list, provided that the company also meets the other requirements of the statute. In its certification, the company must name the association of which it is a member and the company must specifically establish that it was a member of the association at the time the association filed the petition with the USITC.
(2)
Exceptions.
A party who is named on the USITC list is not an “affected domestic producer” under the following circumstances:
(i)
Product no longer produced.
A company, business or person that has ceased production of the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order,
i.e.,
did not manufacture that product at all during the fiscal year that is the subject of the disbursement, is not an
affected domestic producer under this section.
(ii)
Acquisition by related company
—(A)
Related company defined.
A company, business or person is not an affected domestic producer if that company, business, or person has been acquired by another company or business that is related to a company that opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that led to the order or finding. For purposes of this paragraph, a company, business or person is related to another company, business or person if:
(
1
) The company, business or person directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by the other company, business or person;
(
2
) A third party directly or indirectly controls both companies, businesses or persons; or
(
3
) Both companies, businesses or persons directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the first company, business or person to act differently than a nonrelated party.
(B)
Control of one party by another.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, one party would be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party was legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.
(c)
Qualifying expenditures.
Qualifying expenditures which may be offset by a distribution of assessed antidumping and countervailing duties must fall within the categories described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(10) of this section. These expenditures must be incurred after the issuance, and prior to the termination, of the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order under which the distribution is sought. Further, these expenditures must be related to the production of the same product that is the subject of the related order or finding, with the exception of expenses incurred by associations which must relate to a specific case.
(1) Manufacturing facilities;
(2) Equipment;
(3) Research and development;
(4) Personnel training;
(5) Acquisition of technology;
(6) Health care benefits for employees paid for by the employer;
(7) Pension benefits for employees paid for by the employer;
(8) Environmental equipment, training, or technology;
(9) Acquisition of raw materials and other inputs; and
(10) Working capital or other funds needed to maintain production.
§ 159.62
Notice of distribution.
(a)
Publication of notice.
At least 90 days before the end of a fiscal year, Customs will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice of intention to distribute assessed duties received as the continued dumping and subsidy offset for that fiscal year. The notice will include the list of domestic producers, based upon the list supplied by the USITC (see § 159.61(b)(1)), that would be potentially eligible to receive the distribution.
(b)
Content of notice.
The notice of intention to distribute the offset will also contain the following:
(1) The case name and number of the particular order or finding concerned, together with the dollar amount contained in the special account for that order or finding as of June 1 of the subject fiscal year (see § 159.64(a)(1)); and
(2) The instructions for filing the certification under § 159.63 in order to claim a distribution.
§ 159.63
Certifications.
(a)
Requirement and purpose for certification.
In order to obtain a distribution of the offset, each affected domestic producer must submit a certification, in triplicate, or electronically as authorized by CBP, to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Administration, Headquarters, or designee, that must be received within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice in the
Federal Register,
indicating that the affected domestic producer desires to receive a distribution. The certification must enumerate the qualifying expenditures incurred by the domestic producer since the issuance of an order or finding for which a distribution has not previously been made, and it must
demonstrate that the domestic producer is eligible to receive a distribution as an affected domestic producer.
(b)
Content of certification.
While there is no established format for a certification, the certification must identify the date of the
Federal Register
notice under which it is submitted, and the case name and the number of the particular order or finding cited in the
Federal Register
notice. The certification must be executed and dated by a party legally authorized to bind the domestic producer. The certification must also state that the information contained in the certification is true and accurate to the best of the certifier's knowledge and belief under penalty of law, and that the domestic producer has records to support the qualifying expenditures being claimed.
(1)
Identifying information for domestic producer.
The certification must include the following identifying information related to the domestic producer:
(i) The name of the domestic producer and any name qualifier, if applicable (for example, any other name under which the domestic producer does business or is also known);
(ii) The address of the domestic producer (if a post office box, the secondary street address must also be included);
(iii) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) number (with suffix) of the domestic producer, employer identification number, or social security number, as applicable;
(iv) The specific business organization of the domestic producer (corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship); and
(v) The name(s) of any individual(s) designated by the domestic producer as the contact person(s) concerning the certification, together with the phone number(s) and/or facsimile transmission number(s) and electronic mail (email) address(es) for the person(s).
(2)
Amount of claim.
In calculating the amount of the distribution being claimed as an offset, the certification must enumerate the following:
(i) The total amount of qualifying expenditures currently and previously certified by the domestic producer, and the amount certified by category (see § 159.61(c)(1) through (c)(10));
(ii) The total amount of those expenditures which have been the subject of any prior distribution under section 754, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675c); and
(iii) The net amount for new and remaining qualifying expenditures being claimed in the current certification (the total amount currently and previously certified as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus the total amount the subject of any prior distribution as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section).
(3)
Statement of eligibility to receive distribution.
The certification must contain a statement that the domestic producer desires to receive a distribution and is eligible to receive the distribution as an affected domestic producer (see § 159.61(b)(1) and (b)(2)).
(i)
Amount certified for payment.
The affected domestic producer must affirm that the net amount certified for distribution does not encompass any qualifying expenditures for which distribution has previously been made (see paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Same qualifying expenditures included on more than one certification.
Where the domestic producer is listed as an affected domestic producer on more than one order or finding covering the same product and files a separate certification for each order or finding using the same qualifying expenditures as the basis for distribution in each case, each certification must list all the other orders or findings where the producer is claiming the same qualifying expenditures.
(iii)
Continued production of product covered by order or finding; acquisition by related company.
The statement must include information as to whether the domestic producer remains in operation and continues to produce the product covered by the particular order or finding under which the distribution is sought (see § 159.61(b)(2)(i)). In addition, the domestic producer must state whether it has been acquired by a company or business that is related to a company, within the meaning of § 159.61(b)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (
3
), that
opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that resulted in the order or finding under which the distribution is sought.
(c)
Review and correction of certification.
A certification that is submitted in response to a notice of distribution and received within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice in the
Federal Register
may be reviewed before acceptance to ensure that all informational requirements are complied with and that any amounts set forth in the certification for current and prior qualifying expenditures, including the amount claimed for distribution, appear to be correct (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section). A certification that is found to be materially incorrect or incomplete will be returned to the domestic producer within 15 days after the close of the 60-day filing period. Within 10 days of the date that Customs returns a certification as being materially incorrect or incomplete, Customs must receive a corrected certification from the affected domestic producer. Customs will make every effort to assist companies to perfect their certifications and will not return claims for minor errors or omissions. However, it remains the sole responsibility of the domestic producer to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory so as to demonstrate the entitlement of the domestic producer to the distribution requested. Failure to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory as provided in this paragraph will result in the domestic producer not receiving a distribution.
(d)
Verification of certification; supporting records.
Certifications are subject to verification. Parties, therefore, are required to maintain the accounting records used in developing their claims, for a period of five years after the filing of the certification. The records supporting certifications must be those that are normally kept in the ordinary course of business (see § 163.1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(vi) of this chapter). Parties must be able to demonstrate that their records specifically support each qualifying expenditure enumerated in a certification. In addition, the claimant must be able to support how qualifying expenditures are determined to be related to the production of the product covered by the order or finding.
(e)
Disclosure of information in certifications; acceptance by producer.
The name of the affected domestic producer, the total dollar amount claimed by that party on the certification, as well as the total dollar amount that Customs actually disburses to that company as an offset, will be available for disclosure to the public (see § 159.64(g)(1)). The submission of the certification will be construed as an understanding and acceptance on the part of the domestic producer that this information will be disclosed to the public. Alternatively, a statement in a certification that this information is proprietary and exempt from disclosure will result in Customs rejection of the certification.
[T.D. 01-68, 66 FR 48552, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-21, 77 FR 73309, Dec. 10, 2012]
§ 159.64
Distribution of offset.
(a)
The creation of Special Accounts and Clearing Accounts
—(1)
Special Accounts.
As directed in the legislation (19 U.S.C. 1675c(e)), Customs will establish Special Accounts for each antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, into which funds will be transferred as set out in paragraph (b) of this section. All distributions to affected domestic producers will be made from the Special Accounts.
(2)
Clearing Accounts.
In order to properly manage and account for dumping and subsidy offsets, as well as any requisite refunds to importers, Customs will also establish Clearing Accounts. All estimated antidumping and countervailing duties received pursuant to an antidumping or countervailing order or finding in effect on January 1, 1999, or thereafter, will be deposited into a Clearing Account.
(b)
Distribution of assessed duties received from the Special Accounts; refunds resulting from reliquidation or court action; and overpayments to affected domestic producers
—(1)
Distribution of assessed duties received from the Special Accounts.
(i) No later than 60 days after the end of a fiscal year, Customs will distribute the assessed duties transferred from
the Clearing Accounts and received into the Special Accounts. The amount distributed shall be referred to as the dumping and subsidy offset;
(ii) Transfers from the Clearing Accounts to the Special Accounts will be made by Customs throughout the fiscal year. Transfers will occur between a Clearing Account and a Special Fund Account when an entry upon which antidumping or countervailing duties are owed is properly liquidated pursuant to an order, finding or receipt of liquidation instructions;
(iii) The amount transferred at liquidation to the Special Account will be dependent upon the amount actually collected on the entry and in the Clearing Account. Following liquidation, additional transfers will be made on the liquidated entry to the corresponding Special Account, as additional antidumping or countervailing duties are collected.
(2)
Refunds resulting from reliquidation or court action.
If any of the underlying entries composing a prior distribution should reliquidate for a refund, such refund will be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Similarly, refunds to importers resulting from any court action involving those entries will also be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Refunds to importers will not be delayed pending the recovery of overpayments from domestic producers as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Overpayments to affected domestic producers.
Overpayments to affected domestic producers resulting from subsequent reliquidations and/or court actions and determined by Customs to be not otherwise recoverable from the corresponding Special Account as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be collected from the affected domestic producers. The amount of each affected domestic producer's bill will be directly proportional to the total dumping and subsidy offset amounts that the affected domestic producer previously received under the related Special Account. All available collection methods will be used by Customs to collect outstanding bills, including but not limited to, administrative offset. Interest at the same rate set out at § 24.3a(c) of this chapter will begin to accrue on unpaid bills 30 days from the bill date.
(c)
Payment of certified claims.
(1) If the total amount of the certified net claims filed by affected domestic producers does not exceed the amount of the offset available for distribution in the corresponding Special Account, the certified net claim for each affected domestic producer will be paid in full.
(2) If the certified net claims exceed the dumping and subsidy offset amount available in the corresponding Special Account, such offset will be made on a pro rata basis based on each affected domestic producer's total certified claim.
(3) In any case where the distribution is not for the entire certified qualifying expenditure submitted by an affected domestic producer, and if the affected domestic producer believes that the reduction was the result of clerical error or mistake by Customs, it must file a request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days to the address given in the notification. After considering the matter, the Customs Service will notify the party requesting reconsideration of its decision. However, any adjustments will be made only from funds remaining in the account for that case in the current or future fiscal years, and will be paid prior to any future distributions.
(d)
Final distribution and termination of the Special Account.
(1) A Special Account will be terminated and a final distribution will occur when:
(i) The order or finding with respect to which the account was established has terminated; and
(ii) All entries relating to the order or finding are liquidated, all outstanding amounts collected or properly accounted for by Customs, all related protests, petitions, and court actions fully concluded, and all refunds due to importers on the underlying entries are paid in full.
(2) Once the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been met, notice of a final distribution will be issued pursuant to § 159.62.
(3) Amounts not timely claimed under the notice of final distribution will be permanently deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury.
(e)
Interest on Special Accounts and Clearing Accounts.
In accordance with Federal appropriations law, and Treasury guidelines on Special Accounts, funds in such accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Likewise, funds being held in Clearing Accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Therefore, no interest will accrue in these accounts. However, statutory interest charged on antidumping and countervailing duties at liquidation will be transferred to the Special Account, when collected from the importer.
(f)
Distribution final and conclusive.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c)(3) of this section, any distribution made to an affected domestic producer under this section shall be final and conclusive on the affected domestic producer.
(g)
Annual report; disclosure of information.
Although it is not mandated in the law (19 U.S.C. 1675c), Customs will issue an annual report on the disbursements. This report will be available to the public via the Customs website. The annual report will address any initiatives that have been implemented to improve the liquidation and disbursement process. In addition, the annual report will include the information described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
(1)
Company-specific information.
The annual report will include the following information concerning those parties that have submitted certifications for a distribution of the offset with respect to each order or finding as identified by its case number:
(i) The name of the claimant;
(ii) The total dollar amount claimed by that party on its certification; and
(iii) The total dollar amount disbursed to that company by Customs.
(2)
General information.
The annual report will include the following general information for each order or finding as identified by its case number:
(i) The number of entries and dollar amounts in the clearing account at the beginning of each fiscal year;
(ii) The number and amount of Customs re-liquidations during the fiscal year; and
(iii) The dollar amounts remaining uncollected from Customs bills issued during the fiscal year.

§ 161.12
Eligibility for compensation.
In accordance with section 619, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1619), any person not an employee or officer of the United States who either furnishes original information concerning any fraud upon the customs revenue or any violation, perpetrated or contemplated, of the customs or navigation laws or any other laws administered or enforced by Customs, or detects and seizes any item subject to seizure and forfeiture under the customs or navigationlaws or other laws enforced by Customs and reports the same to a Customs officer, may file a claim for compensation, provided there is a net amount recovered from such detection and seizure or such information, unless other laws specify different procedures.

§ 161.14
Advising informant of entitlement.
Any Customs officer who receives information shall advise the informant that, in the event of a recovery, he may be entitled to compensation. He shall also advise the informant that, if
the informant has executed a stipulation to that effect, any amount received by the informant in the form of purchase of evidence or purchase of information will be deducted from any compensation which may be awarded.
§ 161.15
Confidentiality for informant.
The name and address of the informant must be kept confidential. No files or information will be revealed which might aid in the unauthorized identification of an informant. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(D), specific informant records that are exempt from disclosure are those that could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source. Informant records maintained by CBP under an informant's name or personal identifier that are requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier are not subject to the disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a), unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.
[CBP Dec. 15-16, 80 FR 71693, Nov. 17, 2015]
The name and address of the informant shall be kept confidential. No files or information shall be revealed which might aid in the unauthorized identification of an informant. Release of information is governed by §§ 103.12(g)(4) and 103.12(i) of this chapter.
§ 161.16
Filing a claim for informant compensation.
(a)
Limitations on claims.
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1619, an informant may be paid up to 25 percent of the net recovery to the government from duties withheld; from any fine (civil or criminal), forfeited bail bond, penalty, or forfeiture incurred; or, if the forfeiture is remitted, from the monetary penalty recovered for remission of the forfeiture. The amount of the award paid to informants must not exceed $250,000 for any one case, regardless of the number of recoveries that result from the information furnished; however, no claim of less than $100 will be paid.
(b)
Filing of claim.
A claim must be filed, in duplicate, on DHS Form 4623 with the Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, who will make a recommendation on the form as to approval and the amount of the award.

If, after the cargo has been discharged, passengers and their baggage landed, and the baggage of officers and crewmembers examined and passed, the port director or special agent in charge believes that sufficient grounds exist to justify the continuance of Customs supervision of the vessel, the commanding officer or master of the vessel shall be advised accordingly.
