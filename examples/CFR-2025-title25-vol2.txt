# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 301.1
Eligibility for use of Government stamp.
Subject to the detailed requirements that follow, the Government stamp shall be affixed only to work individually produced and to work entirely hand-made. No object produced under conditions resembling a bench work system, and no object in whose manufacture any power-driven machinery has been used, shall be eligible for the use of the Government stamp.
§ 301.2
Specifications of material.
Silver slugs of 1 ounce weight or other silver objects may be used, provided their fineness is at least 900, and provided further that no silver sheet shall be used. Unless cast, the slug or other object is to be hand hammered to thickness and shape desired. The only exceptions here are pins on brooches or similar objects; ear screws for earrings; backs for tie clasps and chains which may be of silver of different fineness and mechanically made.
§ 301.3
Specifications of dies.
Dies used are to be entirely hand-made, with no tools more mechanical than hand tools and vise. Dies shall contain only a single element of the design.
§ 301.4
Application of dies.
Dies are to be applied to the object with the aid of nothing except hand tools.
§ 301.5
Applique elements in design.
All such parts of the ornament are to be hand-made. If wire is used, it is to be hand-made with no tool other than a hand-made draw plate. These requirements apply to the boxes for stone used in the design.
§ 301.6
Stone for ornamentation.
In addition to turquoise, the use of other local stone is permitted. Turquoise, if used, must be genuine stone, uncolored by any artificial means.

§ 304.3

For the present the Indian Arts and Crafts Board reserves to itself the sole right to judge what silver complying with its standards shall bear the Government mark. All such marking of silver shall, for the present, be done by an agent of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board.
§ 304.4
Standards and additional requirements.
No piece of silver, though made in compliance with the standards set forth by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, shall bear the Government mark unless:
(a) Its weight is substantially in accord with Indian usage and custom.
(b) Its design elements are substantially in accord with Indian usage and tradition.
(c) Its workmanship is substantially that expected in good hand craftsmanship.
§ 304.5
Dies to identify tribe.
Dies are marked with name of tribe. A Navajo stamp will be used where the marker is a Navajo Indian; similarly, for Zuni, Hopi, and Rio Grande Pueblo.
§ 304.6
Responsibility of dealer.
All dies will be numbered, and each wholesaler or dealer will be held responsible for any violation of standards in silver that bears his mark. Until such time as the Board relinquishes its sole right to mark silver, the responsibility of the dealer for whom silver is marked will be confined to misrepresentations as to quality of silver and of stones used for ornament and to methods of production.
§ 304.7
Eligibility of silver meeting standards.
In addition to silver currently made in compliance with the standards of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, other silver products made prior to the promulgation of the regulations in this part may be stamped, provided the maker thereof is known to be an Indian, and the product satisfies the requirements in § 304.4.
§ 304.8
Use of label by dealer.
Any dealer offering for sale silver bearing the Government mark may, if he wishes, attach to silver so marked a label or ticket calling attention to the Government mark.
§ 304.9

To be eligible to attach the certificate, an enterprise must meet the following conditions:

(b) It must be entirely Indian owned and organized either by individual Indians or by groups of Indians.
(c) It must agree to apply certificates of genuineness only to such products as meet the standards of quality prescribed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board at the time of the application of the enterprise for the privilege of attaching the certificate.
(d) It must agree to obtain the approval of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board as to the manner of production of the certificates.
§ 308.4

§ 309.1
How do the regulations in this part carry out the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990?
These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 U.S.C. 305
et seq.
) from false representations, and specify how the Indian Arts and Crafts Board will interpret certain conduct for enforcement purposes. The Act makes it unlawful to offer or display for sale or sell any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian, or Indian tribe, or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the United States.
§ 309.2
What are the key definitions for purposes of the Act?
(a)
Indian
as applied to an individual means a person who is a member of an Indian tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the provisions of § 309.4).
(b)
Indian artisan
means an individual who is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan.
(c)
Indian arts and crafts organization
means any legally established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members of Indian tribes.
(d)
Indian product
—(1)
In general.
The term “Indian product” means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the term “made by an Indian” means that an Indian has provided the artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the Indian art or craft object to be an “Indian product.”
(2)
Illustrations.
The term “Indian product” includes, but is not limited to:
(i) Art made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;
(ii) Craft work made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;
(iii) Handcraft made by an Indian,
i.e.
an object created with the help of only such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape and design of each individual product.
(3)
Examples of non-qualifying products.
An “Indian product” under the Act does not include any of the following, for example:
(i) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product made by non-Indian labor;
(ii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is designed by an Indian but produced by non-Indian labor;
(iii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is assembled from a kit;
(iv) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product originating from a commercial product, without substantial transformation provided by Indian artistic or craft work labor;
(v) Industrial products, which for this purpose are defined as goods that have an exclusively functional purpose, do not serve as a traditional artistic medium, and that do not lend themselves to Indian embellishment, such as appliances and vehicles. An industrial product may not become an Indian product.
(vi) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is produced in an assembly line or related production line process using multiple workers not all whom are Indians. For example, if twenty people make up the labor to create the product(s), and one person is not Indian, the product is not an “Indian product.”
(e)
Indian tribe
means—
(1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or
(2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.
(f)
Product of a particular Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization
means that the origin of a product is identified as a named Indian tribe or
named Indian arts and crafts organization.
[61 FR 54555, Oct. 21, 1996; 61 FR 57002, Nov. 5, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 35169, June 12, 2003]
§ 309.6
When does a commercial product become an Indian product?
In addressing Indian embellishments to originally commercial products, the Indian labor expended to add art or craft work to those objects must be sufficient to substantially transform the qualities and appearance of the original commercial item. “Commercial products,” under this part, are consumer goods designed for profit and mass distribution that lend themselves to Indian embellishment, for example clothing and accessories. Through substantial transformation due to Indian labor, a product changes from a commercial product to an Indian product. Examples of formerly commercial products that become Indian products include tennis shoes to which an Indian applies beadwork and denim jackets to which an Indian applies ribbon appliqués.
[68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]
§ 309.7
How should a seller disclose the nature and degree of Indian labor when selling, offering, or displaying art and craft work for sale?
The Indian Arts and Crafts Act is a truth-in-marketing law. Those who produce and market art and craft work should honestly represent and clarify the degree of Indian involvement in the production of the art and craft work when it is sold, displayed or offered for sale. The following guidelines illustrate the way in which art and craft work may be characterized for marketing purposes and gives examples of products that may be marketed as Indian products.
If . . .
then . . .
(a) An Indian conceives, designs, and makes the art or craft work
it is an “Indian product.”
(b) An Indian produces a product that is “handcrafted,” as explained in 309.3(d)(iii)
it can be marketed as such and it meets the definition of “Indian product.”
(c) An Indian makes an art or craft work using some machine made parts
it is “Indian made” and meets the definition of “Indian product.”
(d) An Indian designs a product, such as a bracelet, which is then produced by non-Indians
it does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
(e) A product, such as jewelry, is made with non-artistic Indian labor, from assembled or “fit together parts”
it does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
1
(f) A product in the style of an Indian product is assembled by non-Indian labor from a kit
it does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
(g) A product is in the style of an Indian art or craft product, but not made by an Indian
it does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
(h) An Indian and a non-Indian jointly undertake the art or craft work to produce an art or craft product, for example a concho belt
less than all of the labor is Indian and hence it does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
2
1
For example, a necklace strung with overseas manufactured fetishes or heshi. If an Indian assembled the necklace, in keeping with the truth-in-marketing focus of the Act, it can be marketed as “Indian assembled.” It does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act. Similarly, if a product, such as a dream catcher is assembled by an Indian from a kit, it can be marketed as “Indian assembled.” It does not meet the definition of “Indian product” under the Act.
2
In order to be an “Indian product,” the labor component of the product must be entirely Indian. In keeping with this truth-in-marketing law, a collaborative work should be marketed as such. Therefore, it should be marketed as produced by “X” (name of artist or artisan), “Y” (Tribe of individual's enrollment) or (name of Tribe providing official written certification the individual is a non-member Indian artisan and date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe), and “Z” (name of artist or artisan with no Tribe listed) to avoid providing false suggestions to consumers.
[68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]
§ 309.8
For marketing purposes, what is the recommended method of identifying authentic Indian products?
(a) The recommended method of marketing authentic Indian products is to include the name of the artist or artisan, the name of the Tribe in which the artist or artisan is enrolled, and the individual's Tribal enrollment number. If the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan, rather than an enrolled Tribal member, the product identification should include the name of the Tribe providing official written certification that the individual is a non-member Indian artisan and the date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe. In order for an individual to be certified by an Indian Tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, the individual must be of Indian lineage of one or more members of such Indian Tribe and the certification must be issued in writing by the governing
body of an Indian Tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function by the governing body of the Indian Tribe.
(b) For example, the Indian product should include a label, hangtag, provenance card, or similar identification that includes W (name of the artist or artisan), and X (name of the Tribe in which the individual is enrolled) and Y (individual's Tribal enrollment number), or a statement that the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan of Z (name of the Tribe providing certification and the date upon which the certification was issued by the Tribe).
[68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]
§ 309.9
When can non-Indians make and sell products in the style of Indian arts and crafts?
A non-Indian can make and sell products in the style of Indian art or craft products only if the non-Indian or other seller does not falsely suggest to consumers that the products have been made by an Indian.
[68 FR 35170, June 12, 2003]
§ 309.10
What are some sample categories and examples of Indian products?
What constitutes an Indian product is potentially very broad. However, to provide guidance to persons who produce, market, or purchase items marketed as Indian products, §§ 309.11 through 309.22 contain a sample listing of “specific examples” of objects that meet the definition of Indian products. There is some repetition, due to the interrelated nature of many Indian products when made by Indian artistic labor. The lists in these sections contain examples and are not intended to be all-inclusive. Additionally, although the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and the Indian Arts and Crafts Enforcement Act of 2000 do not address materials used in Indian products, some materials are included for their descriptive nature only. This is not intended to restrict materials used or to exclude materials not listed.

(1) The maker is a member of an Indian tribe, is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, or is a member of the particular Indian tribe named; and
(2) The art or craft product is an Indian product.
(b)
Products of Indians of foreign tribes
—(1)
In general.
The unqualified use of the term “Indian” or of the term “Native American” or the unqualified use of the name of a foreign tribe, in connection with an art or craft product, regardless of where it is produced and regardless of any country-of-origin marking on the product, is interpreted to mean for purposes of this part that—
(i) The maker is a member of an Indian tribe, is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, or is a member of the particular Indian tribe named;
(ii) The tribe is resident in the United States; and
(iii) The art or craft product is an Indian product.

Exception where country of origin is disclosed.
Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to any art or craft for which the name of the foreign country of tribal ancestry is clearly disclosed in conjunction with marketing of the product.

# Example.
X is a lineal descendant of a member of Indian Tribe A. However, X is not a member of Indian Tribe A, nor is X certified by Indian Tribe A as a non-member Indian artisan. X may not be described in connection with the marketing of an art or craft product made by X as an Indian, a Native American, a member of an Indian tribe, a member of Tribe A, or as a non-member Indian artisan of an Indian tribe. However, the true statement may be used that X is of Indian descent, Native American descent, or Tribe A descent.

(6) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges and enforced collection;
(7) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or office at the Commission that is available to discuss the debt; and

[66 FR 58057, Nov. 20, 2001, as amended at 80 FR 31994, June 5, 2015]
§ 513.5
What is the Commission's policy on interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs?
(a) Interest.
(1) The Commission will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.
(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Commission will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717.
(b) Penalties. The Commission will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any portion of a delinquent debt.
(c) Administrative costs. The Commission will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of the debtor's failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the cost of providing a copy of the file to the debtor and costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Commission.
(d) Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue throughout any appeal process.
(e) Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.
(f) Additional authority. The Commission may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.
(g) Waiver. (1) Regardless of the amount of the debt, the Chairman may decide to waive collection of all or part of the accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs if collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Commission's best interest.
(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, when charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Chairman's decision whether to waive collection of these charges is final and not subject to further review.
§ 513.6
What are the requirements for offset review?
(a) The Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Commission determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence.
(b) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Commission will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.
(c) When an oral hearing is not required, the Commission will review the request for reconsideration based on the written record.
§ 513.7
What is the Commission's policy on revoking a debtor's ability to engage in Indian gaming for failure to pay a debt?
The Chairman of the Commission may revoke a debtor's ability to operate, manage, or otherwise participate in the operation of an Indian gaming facility if the debtor inexcusably or willfully fails to pay a debt. The revocation of ability to engage in gaming may last only as long as the debtor's indebtedness.

§ 513.20
What debts can the Commission refer to Treasury for collection by administrative and tax refund offset?

# Subpart C—Salary Offset
§ 513.30
When may the Commission use salary offset to collect debts?
(a) The Commission collects debts owed by employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset under the authority of: 5 U.S.C. 5514; 31 U.S.C. 3716; 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; and this subpart. Salary offset is applicable when the Commission is attempting to collect a debt owed by an individual employed by the Commission or another agency.
(b) Nothing in the regulations in this subpart precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, or the Federal Claims Collection Standards.
(c) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code takes precedence over a salary offset under this subpart, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d) and 31 U.S.C. 3716.
(d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly prohibited by another statute.
(e) This subpart's regulations covering notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions do not apply to:
(1) Any routine intra-agency adjustment in pay that is attributable to clerical or administrative error or delay in processing pay documents that have occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, or any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less. However, at the time of any adjustment, or as soon thereafter as possible, the Commission's payroll agency will provide the employee with a written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a contact point for appealing the adjustment.
(2) Any negative adjustment to pay that arises from the debtor's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four or fewer pay periods. However, at the time of the adjustment, the Commission's payroll agent will provide in the debtor's earnings statement a clear statement informing the debtor of the previous overpayment.
(f) An employee's involuntary payment of all or any of the debt through salary offset will not be construed as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under the law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.
§ 513.31
What notice will the Commission, as the creditor agency, give a debtor that salary offset will occur?
(a) Deductions from a debtor's salary will not be made unless the Commission sends the debtor a written Notice of Intent at least 30 calendar days before the salary offset is initiated.
(b) The Notice of Intent will include the following:
(1) Notice that the Commission has reviewed the records relating to the debt and has determined that the employee owes the debt;
(2) Notice that, after a 30-day period, the Commission will begin to collect the debt by deductions from the employee's current disposable pay account and the date on which deductions from salary will start;
(3) The amount of the debt and the facts giving rise to it;
(4) The frequency and the amount of the intended deduction stated as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of pay not to exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay, and the intention to continue the deductions until the debt and all accumulated interest are paid in full or resolved;
(5) The name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom the debtor may propose a written alternative schedule for voluntary repayment in lieu of salary offset. The debtor must include a justification for the alternative schedule in the proposal;
(6) The Commission's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, set out at § 513.5, and a statement that assessments will be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS;
(7) Notice of the employee's right to inspect and copy all Commission records pertaining to the debt and the name, address, and telephone number of the Commission employee to whom requests for access must be made;
(8) Notice of the employee's opportunity to a hearing conducted by an individual who does not work for the Commission on the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of the repayment schedule;
(9) Notice that filing a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following the debtor's receiving the Notice of Intent will stay collection proceedings and that a final decision will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition for hearing, unless the employee requests, and a hearing official grants, a delay in proceedings;
(10) An explanation of the effect of submitting knowingly false or frivolous statements; and
(11) Notice that amounts paid on or deducted from debts that are later waived or found not to be owed will be promptly refunded to the employee.
§ 513.32
What are the hearing procedures when the Commission is the creditor agency?
(a) To request a hearing, the debtor must file, within 15 days of receiving the Commission's notice of intent to offset, a written petition signed by the debtor and addressed to the Commission stating why the debtor believes the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt is in error. The Commission may waive the 15-day time limit for filing a request for hearing if the employee shows that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her control or because the employee did not receive notice of the 15-day time limit. A debtor who has previously obtained a hearing to contest a debt that arose from a notice of violation or proposed civil fine assessment matters under 25 CFR parts 580 through 585 may not re-litigate matters that were at issue in that hearing.
(b) Regardless of whether the debtor is a Commission employee, the Commission will provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official who is not from the Commission.
(c) The hearing will be conducted according to the FCCS review requirements at 31 CFR 901.3(e).
(d) Unless the employee requests, and a hearing official grants, a delay in proceedings, within 60 days after the petition for hearing the hearing official will issue a written decision on:
(1) The determination of the creditor agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt; and
(2) The repayment schedule, if a schedule was not established by written agreement between the employee and the creditor agency.
(e) If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected by salary offset but the Commission has determined that the debt is valid, the Commission may seek collection of the debt through other means in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
(f) The form of hearings, written responses, and final decisions will be according to the Commission's review requirements at § 513.7. Written decisions regarding salary offset that are provided after a request for hearing must state: The facts purported to evidence the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the employee's or creditor agency's grounds; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where applicable, the repayment schedule.
[66 FR 58057, Nov. 20, 2001, as amended at 80 FR 31994, June 5, 2015]
§ 513.33
Will the Commission issue a certification when the Commission is the creditor agency?
Yes. Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Commission will submit a certification to Treasury or to a paying agency in the form prescribed by the paying agency.
§ 513.34
What opportunity is there for a voluntary repayment agreement when the Commission is the creditor agency?
(a) In response to a Notice of Intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt voluntarily in lieu of salary offset by submitting a written proposed repayment schedule to the Commission. A proposal must be received by the Commission within 15 calendar days after the employee is sent the Notice of Intent.
(b) The Commission will notify the employee whether, within the Commission's discretion, the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable.
(c) If the proposed repayment schedule is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 calendar days from the date the notice of the decision is received in which to file a request for a hearing.
(d) If the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable or the employee agrees to a modification proposed by the Commission, the agreement will be put in writing and signed by the employee and the Commission.
§ 513.35
What special review is available when the Commission is the creditor agency?
(a)(1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Commission of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
(2) The request for special review must include an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a detailed statement, with supporting documents, that shows why the current salary offset or payment results in extreme financial hardship to the employee, spouse, or dependents. The statement must indicate:
(i) Income from all sources;
(ii) Assets;
(iii) Liabilities;
(iv) Number of dependents;
(v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
(vi) Medical expenses; and
(vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.
(b) The Commission will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Commission will notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of its determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Commission will provide a new certification to the paying agency.
§ 513.36
Under what conditions will the Commission refund amounts collected by salary offset?
(a) As the creditor agency, the Commission will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:
(1) The Commission determines that the debt is not owed; or
(2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Commission to make a refund.
(b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section will not bear interest.
§ 513.37
What will the Commission do as the paying agency?
(a) When the Commission receives a certification from a creditor agency that has complied with the Office of Personnel Management's requirements set out at 5 CFR 550.1109, the Commission will send the employee a written notice of salary offset.
(b) If the Commission receives an incomplete certification from a creditor agency, the Commission will return the certification with notice that the procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed and a properly certified claim submitted before the Commission will take action to collect the debt from the employee's current pay account.
(c) Notice to a debtor will include:
(1) The Commission's receipt of a certification from a creditor agency;
(2) The amount of the debt and the deductions to be made, which may be stated as a percentage of disposable pay; and
(3) The date and pay period when the salary offset will begin.
(d) The Commission will provide a copy of the notice of salary offset to a creditor agency.
(e) The Commission will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.
(f) The Commission's payroll officer will determine the amount of the debtor's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.
(g) The Commission may use the following types of salary debt collection:
(1) Lump sum offset. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump sum offset.
(2) Installment deductions. The amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the debtor has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will liquidate the debt in three years or less.
(3) Deductions from final check. A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.
(4) Deductions from other sources. If an employee subject to salary offset is leaving the Commission and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, then the Commission may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards.
(h) When two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, the Commission's payroll office may, in its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.
(i) The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.

# Subpart D—Administrative Wage Garnishment
§ 513.40
How will the Commission handle debt collection through administrative wage garnishment?
This part adopts all the provisions of the administrative wage garnishment regulations contained in 31 CFR 285.11, promulgated by Treasury, which allow Federal agencies to collect debts from a debtor's non-Federal pay by means of administrative wage garnishment authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and in 5 CFR parts 581 and 582, promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, which provides for garnishment orders for child support and/or alimony and commercial garnishment of federal employees' pay.

(a) In the event that a gaming operation fails to submit a fee payment or quarterly statement in a timely manner, the Chair of the Commission may issue a notice specifying:
(1) The date the statement and/or payment was due;
(2) The number of calendar days late the statement and/or payment was submitted;
(3) A citation to the federal or tribal requirement that has been or is being violated;
(4) The action being considered by the Chair; and
(5) Notice of rights of appeal pursuant to subchapter H of this chapter.
(b) Within fifteen (15) days of service of the notice, the recipient may submit written information about the notice to the Chair. The Chair shall consider any information submitted by the recipient as well as the recipient's history of untimely submissions or failure to file statements and/or fee payments over the preceding five (5) years in determining the amount of the late fee, if any.
(c) When practicable, within thirty (30) days of issuing the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section to a recipient, the Chair of the Commission may assess a proposed late fee against a recipient for each failure to file a timely quarterly statement and/or fee payment:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2717(a)(4), failure to pay fees shall be grounds for revocation of the approval of the Chair of any license, ordinance or resolution required under IGRA for the operation of gaming. In accordance with § 573.4(a)(2) of this chapter, if a tribe, management contractor, or individually owned gaming operation fails to pay the annual fee, the Chair may issue a notice of violation and, simultaneously with or subsequently to the notice of violation, a temporary closure order.

In the event a settlement is reached, a settlement agreement shall be prepared and executed by the Chair and the recipient. If a settlement agreement is executed, the recipient shall be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the notice or late fee in question, except as otherwise provided expressly in the settlement agreement. In the absence of a settlement of the issues under this paragraph (b), the recipient may contest the proposed late fee before the Commission in accordance with subchapter H of this chapter.
§ 514.12
When does a notice of late submission and/or a proposed late fee become a final order of the Commission and final agency action?
If the recipient fails to appeal under subchapter H of this chapter, the notice and the proposed late fee shall become a final order of the Commission and final agency action.

(a) The total amount of all fees imposed during any fiscal year shall not exceed the statutory maximum imposed by Congress. The Commission shall credit pro-rata any fees collected in excess of this amount against amounts otherwise due.
(b) To the extent that revenue derived from fees imposed under the rates of fees established under § 514.2 are not expended or committed at the close of any fiscal year, such funds shall remain available until expended to defray the costs of operations of the Commission.
§ 514.15
May tribes submit fingerprint cards to the Commission for processing?
Tribes may submit fingerprint cards to the Commission for processing by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Commission may charge a fee to process fingerprint cards on behalf of the tribes.

§ 515.1
Purpose and scope.
This part contains the regulations the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission) follows in implementing the Privacy Act of 1974. These regulations should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The regulations in this part apply to all records contained within systems of records maintained by the Commission that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Commission. The Commission shall also process all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Commission's FOIA regulations contained in 25 CFR part 517, which gives requesters maximum disclosure.
§ 515.2
Definitions.
For the purposes of this subpart:
(a)
Individual
means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(b)
Maintain
means store, collect, use, or disseminate.
(c)
Record
means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by the Commission, including education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history, and that contains the individual's name, or identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual, such as social security number, finger or voice print, or photograph.
(d)
System of records
means a group of any records under the control of the Commission from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual.

§ 515.3
Request for access to records.
(a)
How made and addressed.
Any individual may make a request to the Commission for access to records about him or herself. Such requests shall conform to the requirements of this section. The request may be made in person at 90 K Street NE., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, in writing at NIGC Attn: Privacy Act Office, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop #1621, Washington, DC 20240, or via electronic mail addressed to
PARequests@nigc.gov.
(b)
Description of records sought.
Each request for access to records must describe the records sought in enough detail to enable Commission personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which the records were compiled, any tribal gaming facility with which they were associated, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which the records are kept.
(c)
Agreement to pay fees.
Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information. The requester must send acknowledgment to the Privacy Act Officer indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such an acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request will be administratively closed.
(d)
Verification of identity.
When making a request for access to records the individual seeking access must provide verification of identity. The requester must provide a full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The request must be signed and must either be notarized or submitted under 28
U.S.C. 1746, which is a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to assist in the identification and location of requested records, a request may also, at the requester's option, include a social security number.
(e)
Verification of guardianship.
When making a request as a parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, the request must establish:
(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;
(2) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;
(3) That the requester is the parent or guardian of the individual and proof of such relationship by providing a birth certificate showing parentage or a court order establishing guardianship; and
(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.
(f)
Verification in the case of third party information requests.
Any individual who desires to have a record covered by this part disclosed to or mailed to another person may designate such person and authorize such person to act as his or her agent for that specific purpose. The authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual whose record is requested, and notarized or witnessed as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(g)
In-person disclosures.
An individual to whom a record is to be disclosed in person, pursuant to this section, may have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him or her when the record is disclosed. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.
[82 FR 8141, Jan. 24, 2017, as amended at 82 FR 34403, July 25, 2017]
§ 515.4
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
In general.
In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform the requester of that date.
(b)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The Privacy Act Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part access to records.
(c)
Consultations and referrals.
When the Commission receives a request for a record in its possession, the Privacy Act Officer shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:
(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or
(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it, or to another agency that originated the record. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.
(d)
Notice of referral.
Whenever the Privacy Act Officer refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.
§ 515.5
Responses to requests for access to records.
(a)
Acknowledgement of requests.
Upon receipt of a request, the Privacy Act
Officer ordinarily shall, within 20 working days, send an acknowledgement letter which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 515.9 and provide an assigned request number.
(b)
Grants of requests for access.
Once the Privacy Act Officer makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The notice shall inform the requester of any fee charged under § 515.9 of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the Privacy Act Officer will disclose the records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.
(c)
Adverse determinations of requests for access.
If the Privacy Act Officer makes any adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. The notification letter shall be signed by the official making the determination and include:
(1) The name and title of the person responsible for the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied to the denial;
(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 515.7 and a description of the requirements of § 515.7.
§ 515.6
Request for amendment or correction of records.
(a)
How made and addressed.
An individual may make a request for an amendment or correction to a Commission record about that individual by writing directly to the Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3. The request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that is sought, and state why the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The request may include any documentation that would be helpful to substantiate the reasons for the amendment sought.
(b)
Privacy Act Officer response.
The Privacy Act Officer shall, not later than 10 working days after receipt of a request for an amendment or correction of a record, acknowledge receipt of the request and provide notification of whether the request is granted or denied. If the request is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall describe the amendment or correction made and shall advise the requester of the right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record. If the request is denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall send a letter signed by the denying official stating:
(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and
(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Appeals.
A requester may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in § 515.7. If the appeal is denied, the requester shall be advised of the right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of the right under the Privacy Act for judicial review of the decision.
(d)
Statements of Disagreement.
If the appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, the requester has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states the reason(s) for disagreeing with the Privacy Act Officer's denial of the request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. The Statement of Disagreement shall be placed in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and the record shall be marked to indicate a Statement of Disagreement has been filed.
(e)
Notification of amendment, correction, or disagreement.
Within 30 working days of the amendment or correction of the record, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, and if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the
record has been amended or corrected. If a Statement of Disagreement was filed, the Commission shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend the record.
(f)
Records not subject to amendment.
Section 515.13 lists the records that are exempt from amendment or correction.
§ 515.7
Appeals of initial adverse agency determination.
(a)
Adverse determination.
An initial adverse agency determination of a request may consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that the requested record is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination that a record will not be amended; a determination to deny a request for an accounting; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and any associated denial of a request for expedited treatment under the Commission's FOIA regulations.
(b)
Appeals.
If the Privacy Act Officer issues an adverse determination in response to a request, the requester may file a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by the original request, the initial adverse determination that is being appealed, and a statement describing why the adverse determination was in error. The appeal shall be addressed to the Privacy Act Appeals Officer at the locations listed in § 515.3 of this part no later than 90 calendar days after the date of the letter denying the request. Both the appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Privacy Act Appeal.” Any Privacy Act appeals submitted via electronic mail should state “Privacy Act Appeal” in the subject line.
(c)
Responses to appeals.
The decision on appeal will be made in writing within 20 working days of receipt of the notice of appeal by the Privacy Act Appeals Officer. For good cause shown, however, the Privacy Act Appeals Officer may extend the 20 day working period. If such an extension is taken, the requester shall be promptly notified of such extension and the anticipated date of decision. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the determination, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision. The response to the appeal shall also advise of the right to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of the decision.
(d)
When appeal is required.
In order to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of an adverse determination, a requester must first appeal it under this section.
[82 FR 8141, Jan. 24, 2017, as amended at 82 FR 34403, July 25, 2017]
§ 515.8
Requests for an accounting of record disclosure.
(a)
How made and addressed.
Subject to the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual may make a request for an accounting of the disclosures of any record about that individual that the Commission has made to another person, organization, or agency. The accounting contains the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made in writing to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3.
(b)
Where accountings are not required.
The Commission is not required to provide an accounting where they relate to:
(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept, such as those that are made to employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties and disclosures that are made under section 552 of title 5;
(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law
enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or
(3) Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements.
(c)
Appeals.
A requester may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in § 515.7 of this part and the same procedures will be followed.
(d)
Preservation of accountings.
All accountings made under this section will be retained for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.
§ 515.9
Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.
(a)
Court-ordered disclosures.
When a record pertaining to an individual is required to be disclosed by a court order, the Privacy Act Officer shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice of this to the individual. Notice shall be given within a reasonable time after the Privacy Act Officer's receipt of the order—except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice shall be given only after the order becomes public. This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and shall contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice shall not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.
(b)
Emergency disclosures.
Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an individual made under compelling circumstances affecting health or safety, the Privacy Act Officer shall, within a reasonable time, notify that individual of the disclosure. This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and shall state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying disclosure.
§ 515.10
Fees.
The Commission shall charge fees for duplication of records under the Privacy Act in the same way in which it charges duplication fees under § 517.9 of this chapter. No search or review fee may be charged for any record. Additionally, when the Privacy Act Officer makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of reviewing the record or granting access to the record, the Commission shall not charge for the cost of making that copy. Otherwise, the Commission may charge a fee sufficient to cover the cost of duplicating a record.
[82 FR 8141, Jan. 24, 2017, as amended at 82 FR 34403, July 25, 2017]
§ 515.11
Penalties.
Any person who makes a false statement in connection with any request for access to a record, or an amendment thereto, under this part, is subject to the penalties prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 494 and 495.
§ 515.12
[Reserved]
§ 515.13
Specific exemptions.
(a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (f):
(1) Indian Gaming Individuals Records System.
(2) Management Contract Individuals Record System.
(b) The exemptions under paragraph (a) of this section apply only to the extent that information in these systems is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). When compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the overall responsibilities of the Commission, with respect to licensing of key employees and primary management officials for employment in an Indian gaming operation or verifying the suitability of an individual who has a financial interest in, or management responsibility for a management contract, the applicable exemption may be waived by the Commission.
(c) Exemptions from the particular sections are justified for the following reasons:
(1) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), because making available the accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of a record could reveal investigative interest. This would permit the individual to take measures to destroy evidence, intimidate potential
witnesses, or flee the area to avoid the investigation.
(2) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(1), and (f) concerning individual access to records, when such access could compromise classified information related to national security, interfere with a pending investigation or internal inquiry, constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or pose a potential threat to the Commission or its employees or to law enforcement personnel. Additionally, access could reveal the identity of a source who provided information under an express promise of confidentiality.
(3) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), because to require the Commission to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant, or untimely, because of the nature of the information collected and the length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible administrative and investigative burden by continually forcing the Commission to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.
(4) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) because:
(i) It is not always possible to determine relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation.
(ii) Relevance and necessity are matters of judgment and timing in that what appears relevant and necessary when collected may be deemed unnecessary later. Only after information is assessed can its relevance and necessity be established.
(iii) In any investigation the Commission may receive information concerning violations of law under the jurisdiction of another agency. In the interest of effective law enforcement and under 25 U.S.C. 2716(b), the information could be relevant to an investigation by the Commission.
(iv) In the interviewing of individuals or obtaining evidence in other ways during an investigation, the Commission could obtain information that may or may not appear relevant at any given time; however, the information could be relevant to another investigation by the Commission.

§ 517.1
General provisions.
This part contains the regulations the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission) follows in implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These regulations provide procedures by which you may obtain access to records compiled, created, and maintained by the Commission, along with procedures the
Commission must follow in response to such requests for records. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records maintained by the Commission. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a), are processed in accordance with the Commission's Privacy Act regulations, 25 CFR part 515, as well as under this part.
§ 517.2
Public reading room.
Records that are required to be maintained by the Commission shall be available for public inspection and copying at 90 K Street NE, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002. Reading room records created on or after November 1, 1996, shall be made available electronically via the Commission's website.
§ 517.3
Definitions.
(a)
Commercial use requester
means a requester seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of himself or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category, the FOIA Officer shall determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Officer shall contact the requester for additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
(b)
Confidential commercial information
means records or information provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
(c)
Direct costs
mean those expenditures by the Commission actually incurred in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in response to the FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee or employees performing the work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.
(d)
Duplication
refers to the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of, among other things, paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or electronic records (
e.g.,
compact discs or USB flash drives). The copies provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.
(e)
Educational institution
refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary school, an institute of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institute of professional education, or an institute of vocational education which operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.
(f)
Freedom of Information Act Officer
means the person designated by the Chairman to administer the FOIA.
(g)
Non-commercial scientific institution
refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is used in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.
(h)
Record
means an agency record that is either created or obtained by an agency and is under agency control at the time of the FOIA request.
(i)
Representative of the news media
means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial
skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available for purchase by or free distribution to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. For a “freelance journalist” to be regarded as working for a news organization, the requester must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, such as a publication contract. Absent such showing, the requester may provide documentation establishing the requester's past publication record. To qualify for this category, the requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting a news-dissemination function shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
(j)
Requester
means any person, including an individual, Indian tribe, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a Federal agency, that requests access to records in the possession of the Commission.
(k)
Review
means the process of examining a record in response to a FOIA request to determine if any portion of that record may be withheld under one or more of the FOIA Exemptions. It also includes processing any record for disclosure, for example, redacting information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under § 517.7(c). Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the use of FOIA Exemptions.
(l)
Search
refers to the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within a document and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA Officer shall ensure that searches are conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.
(m)
Submitter
means any person or entity who provides information directly or indirectly to the Commission. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, Indian tribal governments, state governments and foreign governments.
(n)
Working day
means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.
§ 517.4
Requirements for making requests.
(a)
How to make a FOIA request.
Requests for records made pursuant to the FOIA must be in writing. Requests may be mailed, dropped off in person, or faxed to (202) 632-7066 (not a toll free number). Requests that are dropped off in person should be made at 90 K Street NE, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Requests that are mailed should be sent to NIGC Attn: FOIA Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mail Stop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Requests may also be sent via electronic mail addressed to
FOIARequests@nigc.gov
or submitted through the Commission's website.
(b)
First person requests for records.
If the requester is making a request for records about himself/herself, the requester must provide verification of identity. Verification requirements are described in 25 CFR 515.3.
(c)
Requests for records about another individual.
If the requester is making a request for records about another individual, the requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of the death certificate or a copy of the obituary).
(d)
Description of records sought.
Requests for records shall describe the records requested with as much specificity as possible to enable Commission
employees to locate the information requested with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the subject matter of the records sought, the time periods in which the records were generated, and any tribe or tribal gaming facility with which they were associated. Before submitting a request, requesters may contact the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records being sought and receive assistance describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA Officer determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA Officer must inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.
(e)
Agreement to pay fees.
Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. If the requester is requesting a waiver or reduction of fees the requester must include justification for such waiver or reduction (see § 517.9(c) for more information). If the request for a fee waiver is denied, the requester will be notified of this decision and advised that fees associated with the processing of the request will be assessed. The requester must send an acknowledgment to the FOIA Officer indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request will be administratively closed.
(f)
Form or format of records requested.
Requesters may specify their preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. The Commission will accommodate such requests where the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
(g)
Types of records not available.
The FOIA does not require the Commission to:
(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;
(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or
(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed.
§ 517.5
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
In general.
In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of that date.
(b)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The FOIA Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part a request for records.
(c)
Granting of requests.
When the FOIA Officer determines that the requested records shall be made available, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester in writing and provide copies of the requested records in whole or in part. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show the exemption applied to the withheld information and the amount of information withheld unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption. If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempt material, all reasonable segregable material shall be disclosed.
(d)
Adverse Determinations.
If the FOIA Officer makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that adverse determination in writing. Adverse determinations include decisions that: The requested record is exempt from release, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has
been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; denials involving fees or fee waiver matters; and denials of requests for expedited processing.
(e)
Content of adverse determination.
Any adverse determination issued by the FOIA Officer must include:
(1) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying access to a record unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption;
(2) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;
(3) A statement that the adverse determination may be appealed under § 517.8 of this part and a description of the appeal requirements; and
(4) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.
(f)
Consultation, referral, and coordination.
When reviewing records located in response to a request, the FOIA Officer will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any record determined to be better suited for review by another Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer must proceed in one of the following ways.
(1)
Consultation.
When records originating with the Commission contain information of interest to another Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.
(2)
Referral.
(i) When the FOIA Officer believes that a different Federal Government agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the FOIA Officer should typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. If the Commission and another Federal Government agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
(ii) Whenever the FOIA Officer refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, he or she must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral.
(iii) After the FOIA Officer refers a record to another Federal Government agency, the agency receiving the referral shall make a disclosure determination and respond directly to the requester. The referral of a record is not an adverse determination and no appeal rights accrue to the requester by this act.
(3)
Coordination.
The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy interests. For example, if the FOIA Officer in responding to a request for records on a living third party locates records originating with a criminal law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the FOIA Officer should coordinate with the originating agency to obtain its views on whether the record may be disclosed. The FOIA Officer should then convey the determination as to whether the record will be released to the requester.
§ 517.6
Timing of responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
The FOIA Officer ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt. All statutory and regulatory timelines will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office that is designated to receive requests in § 517.4(a). In instances of requests misdirected to Commission field offices, the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office, but in any event no later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any Commission office.
(b)
Multitrack processing.
(1) The FOIA Officer may use multi-track processing in responding to requests. Multi-track processing means placing simple requests requiring rather limited review in one processing track and placing more voluminous and complex requests in one or more other tracks. Requests in either track are processed on a first-in/first-out basis.
(2) The FOIA Officer may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of faster track(s). The FOIA Officer will do so either by contacting the requester by letter, telephone, electronic mail, or facsimile whichever is more efficient in each case. When providing a requester with the opportunity to limit the scope of their request, the FOIA Officer shall also advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any dispute arising between the requester and the Commission as well as the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
(c)
Initial determinations.
(1) The FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination regarding access to the requested information and notify the requester within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the request. This 20 day period may be extended if unusual circumstances arise. If an extension is necessary, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the extension, briefly stating the reasons for the extension, and estimating when the FOIA Officer will respond. Unusual circumstances warranting extension are:
(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;
(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of records which are demanded in a single request; or
(iii) The need for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, which consultation shall be conducted with all practicable speed.
(2) If the FOIA Officer decides that an initial determination cannot be reached within the time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the reasons for the delay and include an estimate of when a determination will be made. The requester will then have the opportunity to modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for completion of the request. To assist in this process, the FOIA Officer shall advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Commission, and notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
(3) If no initial determination has been made at the end of the 20 day period provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including any extension, the requester may appeal the action to the FOIA Appeals Officer.
(d)
Expedited processing of request.
(1) A requester may make a request for expedited processing at any time.
(2) When a request for expedited processing is received, the FOIA Officer must determine whether to grant the request for expedited processing within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt. Requests will receive expedited processing if one of the following compelling needs is met:
(i) The requester can establish that failure to receive the records quickly
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(ii) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and can demonstrate that an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity exists.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. As a matter of administrative discretion, the FOIA Officer may waive the formal certification requirement.
(4) Administrative appeals of denials of expedited processing will be given expeditious consideration. If the denial of expedited processing is upheld by the FOIA Appeals Officer, that decision is immediately subject to judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.
§ 517.7
Confidential commercial information.
(a)
Notice to submitters.
The FOIA Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter who provides confidential commercial information to the Commission, with prompt notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing the confidential commercial information if the Commission may be required to disclose the information under the FOIA. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the confidential commercial information. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that notice and opportunity to object has been given to the submitter.
(b)
Where notice is required.
Notice shall be given to a submitter when:
(1) The information has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure. Submitters of confidential commercial information shall use good faith efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions they deem protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Such designation shall be deemed to have expired ten years after the date of submission, unless the requester provides reasonable justification for a designation period of greater duration; or
(2) The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
(c)
Where notice is discretionary.
If the FOIA Officer has reason to believe that information submitted to the Commission may be protected from disclosure under any other exemption of the FOIA, the FOIA Officer may, in his or her discretion, provide the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to the release of that information.
(d)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
The FOIA Officer shall afford a submitter a reasonable period of time to provide the FOIA Officer with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA, and if Exemption 4 applies, shall demonstrate the reasons the submitter believes the information to be confidential commercial information that is exempt from disclosure. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter. In the event a submitter fails to respond to the notice in the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is received after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(e)
Notice of intent to disclose.
The FOIA Officer shall carefully consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information requested. Whenever the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure is appropriate, the FOIA Officer shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to disclosure, provide the submitter with written notice of the intent to disclose which shall include a
statement of the reasons for which the submitter's objections were overruled, a description of the information to be disclosed, and a specific disclosure date. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that the requested records will be made available.
(f)
Notice of lawsuit.
If the requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the submitter of this action. If a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester.
(g)
Exceptions to the notice requirements under this section.
The notice requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply if:
(1) The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be disclosed pursuant to Exemption 4 and/or any other exemption of the FOIA;
(2) The information lawfully has been published or officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the FOIA);
(4) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with this part, when the submitter had the opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or
(5) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with this part appears obviously frivolous. When the FOIA Officer determines that a submitter was frivolous in designating information as confidential, the FOIA Officer must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date, but no opportunity to object to disclosure will be offered.
§ 517.8
Appeals.
(a)
Right of appeal.
The requester has the right to appeal to the FOIA Appeals Officer any adverse determination.
(b)
Notice of Appeal
—(1)
Time for appeal.
To be considered timely, an appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the response or after the time limit for response by the FOIA Officer has expired. Prior to submitting an appeal any outstanding fees associated with FOIA requests must be paid in full.
(2)
Form of appeal.
An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the original request and adverse determination. To expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to present his/her arguments, the notice should contain a brief statement of the reasons why the requester believes the adverse determination to have been in error. Requesters may submit appeals by mail, facsimile, or electronically. Appeals sent by mail shall be addressed to the National Indian Gaming Commission, Attn: FOIA Appeals Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mailstop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Appeals may also be submitted via electronic mail at
FOIARequests@nigc.gov
or through the NIGC's website. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
(c)
Final agency determinations.
The FOIA Appeals Officer shall issue a final written determination, stating the basis for its decision, within twenty (20) working days after receipt of a notice of appeal. If the determination is to provide access to the requested records, the FOIA Officer shall make those records immediately available to the requester. If the determination upholds the adverse determination, the FOIA Appeals Officer shall notify the requester of the determination, the ability to obtain mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and the right to obtain judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.
(d)
When appeal is required.
Before seeking review by a court of the FOIA
Officer's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.
§ 517.9
Fees.
(a)
In general.
Fees pursuant to the FOIA shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered by the Commission in response to requests for records under this part. All fees shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of fees should be by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
(b)
Charges for responding to FOIA requests.
The following fees shall be assessed in responding to requests for records submitted under this part, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:
(1)
Duplication.
The FOIA Officer will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where he or she can readily reproduce the record in the form or format requested. When photocopies are supplied, the FOIA Officer shall charge $0.15 per page for copies of documents up to 8
1/2
x 14. For copies of records produced on tapes, compact discs, or other media, the FOIA Officer shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other methods of reproduction, the FOIA Officer shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the documents.
(2)
Searches
—(i)
Manual searches.
Whenever feasible, the FOIA Officer will charge at the salary rate (basic pay plus 16% percent for benefits) of the employee or employees performing the search. However, where a homogenous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (
e.g.,
all administrative/clerical or all professional/executive), the FOIA Officer shall charge $4.45 per quarter hour for clerical time and $7.75 per quarter hour for professional time. Charges for search time less than a full hour will be in increments of quarter hours.
(ii)
Computer searches.
The FOIA Officer will charge the actual direct costs of conducting computer searches. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for requested records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. For requests that require the creation of a new computer program to locate requested records, the Commission will charge the direct costs associated with such program's creation. The FOIA Officer must notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
(3)
Review fees.
Review fees shall be assessed only with respect to those requesters who seek records for a commercial use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed at the same rates as those listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record review, for example, review undertaken when the FOIA Officer analyzes the applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or portion thereof at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied.
(c)
Statutory waiver.
Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge below that listed in paragraph (b) of this section where it is determined, based upon information provided by a requester or otherwise made known to the FOIA Officer, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and is not primarily for commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a
case by case basis. In order to determine whether the fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA Officer shall consider the following six factors:
(1)
The subject of the request.
Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;
(2)
The informative value of the information to be disclosed.
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;
(3)
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure.
Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding;
(4)
The significance of the contribution to public understanding.
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;
(5)
The existence and magnitude of commercial interest.
Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so
(6)
The primary interest in disclosure.
Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(d)
Types of requesters.
There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; representative of the news media; and all other requesters. These terms are defined in § 517.3. The following specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:
(1)
Commercial use requesters.
The FOIA Officer shall charge commercial use requesters the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.
(2)
Educational and non-commercial scientific institutions requesters.
The FOIA Officer shall charge educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters for document duplication only, except that the first 100 pages of copies shall be provided without charge.
(3)
News media requesters.
The FOIA Officer shall charge news media requesters for document duplication costs only, except that the first 100 pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge.
(4)
All other requesters.
The FOIA Officer shall charge requesters who do not fall into any of the categories in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section fees which cover the full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing records if that total costs exceeds $15.00, except that the first 100 pages and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be charged. To apply this term to computer searches, the FOIA Officer shall determine the total hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's salary (plus 16 percent for benefits). When the cost of the search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, the FOIA Officer will begin assessing charges for the computer search.
(e)
Restrictions on charging fees.
(1) Ordinarily, no charges will be assessed when requested records are not found or when records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees may be charged.
(2) If the Commission fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits for responding to a request, it may not charge search fees or, in cases where records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section.
(i) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the statutory time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.
(ii) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000
pages are necessary to respond to the request, then the Commission may charge search fees and duplication fees, where applicable, if the following steps are taken. The FOIA Officer must:
(A) Provide timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and
(B) Discuss with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).
(iii) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(f)
Charges for interest.
The FOIA Officer may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill, accrued under previous FOIA request(s), starting the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent to you. A fee received by the FOIA Officer, even if not processed will result in a stay of the accrual of interest. The Commission shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, its implementing procedures, and the Commission's debt collection regulations located in 25 CFR part 513 to recover any indebtedness owed to the Commission.
(g)
Aggregating requests.
The requester or a group of requesters may not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of fees, the FOIA Officer may aggregate such request and charge accordingly.
(h)
Advance payment of fees.
Fees may be paid upon provision of the requested records, except that payment may be required prior to that time if the requester has previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA Officer determines that total fee will exceed $250.00. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in § 517.6 shall not be deemed to begin until the FOIA Officer has received payment of the assessed fee.
(i)
Payment of fees.
Where it is anticipated that the cost of providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 after the free duplication and search time has been calculated, and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee greater than $25.00, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the amount of the anticipated fee or a portion thereof, which can readily be estimated. The notification shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with agency representatives for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a reduced cost.

§ 542.3
How do I comply with this part?
(a)
Compliance based upon tier.
(1) Tier A gaming operations must comply with §§ 542.1 through 542.18, and §§ 542.20 through 542.23.
(2) Tier B gaming operations must comply with §§ 542.1 through 542.18, and §§ 542.30 through 542.33.
(3) Tier C gaming operations must comply with §§ 542.1 through 542.18, and §§ 542.40 through 542.43.
(b)
Determination of tier.
(1) The determination of tier level shall be made based upon the annual gross gaming revenues indicated within the gaming operation's audited financial statements. Gaming operations moving from one tier to another shall have nine (9) months from the date of the independent certified public accountant's audit report to achieve compliance with the requirements of the new tier.
(2) The Tribal gaming regulatory authority may extend the deadline by an additional six (6) months if written notice is provided to the Commission no later than two weeks before the expiration of the nine (9) month period.
(c)
Tribal internal control standards.
Within six (6) months of June 27, 2002, each Tribal gaming regulatory authority shall, in accordance with the Tribal gaming ordinance, establish and implement tribal internal control standards that shall:
(1) Provide a level of control that equals or exceeds those set forth in this part;
(2) Contain standards for currency transaction reporting that comply with 31 CFR part 103;
(3) Establish standards for games that are not addressed in this part; and
(4) Establish a deadline, which shall not exceed nine (9) months from June 27, 2002, by which a gaming operation must come into compliance with the tribal internal control standards. However, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority may extend the deadline by an additional six (6) months if written notice is provided to the Commission no later than two weeks before the expiration of the nine (9) month period.
(d)
Gaming operations.
Each gaming operation shall develop and implement an internal control system that, at a minimum, complies with the tribal internal control standards.
(1)
Existing gaming operations.
All gaming operations that are operating on or before June 27, 2002, shall comply with this part within the time requirements established in paragraph (c) of this section. In the interim, such operations shall continue to comply with existing tribal internal control standards.
(2)
New gaming operations.
All gaming operations that commence operations after August 26, 2002, shall comply with this part before commencement of operations.
(e)
Submission to Commission.
Tribal regulations promulgated pursuant to this part shall not be required to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to 25 CFR 522.3(b).
(f)
CPA testing.
(1) An independent certified public accountant (CPA) shall be engaged to perform “Agreed-Upon Procedures” to verify that the gaming operation is in compliance with the minimum internal control standards (MICS) set forth in this part or a Tribally approved variance thereto that has received Commission concurrence. The CPA shall report each event and procedure discovered by or brought to the CPA's attention that the CPA believes does not satisfy the minimum standards or Tribally approved variance that has received Commission concurrence. The “Agreed-Upon Procedures” may be performed in conjunction with the annual audit. The CPA shall report its findings to the Tribe, Tribal gaming regulatory authority, and management. The Tribe shall submit two copies of the report to the Commission within 120 days of the gaming operation's fiscal year end. This regulation is intended to communicate the Commission's position on the minimum agreed-upon procedures to be performed by the CPA. Throughout these regulations, the CPA's engagement and reporting are based on Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) in effect as of December 31, 2003, specifically SSAE 10 (“Revision and Recodification Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements.”). If future revisions are made to the SSAEs or new SSAEs are adopted that are applicable to this type of engagement, the CPA is to comply with any new or revised professional standards in conducting engagements pursuant to these regulations and the issuance of the agreed-upon procedures report. The CPA shall perform the “Agreed-Upon Procedures” in accordance with the following:
(i) As a prerequisite to the evaluation of the gaming operation's internal control systems, it is recommended that the CPA obtain and review an organization chart depicting segregation of functions and responsibilities, a description of the duties and responsibilities of each position shown on the organization chart, and an accurate, detailed narrative description of the gaming operation's procedures in effect that demonstrate compliance.
(ii) Complete the CPA NIGC MICS Compliance checklists or other comparable testing procedures. The checklists should measure compliance on a sampling basis by performing walk-throughs, observations and substantive testing. The CPA shall complete separate checklists for each gaming revenue center, cage and credit, internal
audit, surveillance, information technology and complimentary services or items. All questions on each applicable checklist should be completed. Work-paper references are suggested for all “no” responses for the results obtained during testing (unless a note in the “W/P Ref” can explain the exception).
(iii) The CPA shall perform, at a minimum, the following procedures in conjunction with the completion of the checklists:
(A) At least one unannounced observation of each of the following: Gaming machine coin drop, gaming machine currency acceptor drop, table games drop, gaming machine coin count, gaming machine currency acceptor count, and table games count. The AICPA's “Audits of Casinos” Audit and Accounting Guide states that “observations of operations in the casino cage and count room should not be announced in advance * * *” For purposes of these procedures, “unannounced” means that no officers, directors, or employees are given advance information regarding the dates or times of such observations. The independent accountant should make arrangements with the gaming operation and Tribal gaming regulatory authority to ensure proper identification of the CPA's personnel and to provide for their prompt access to the count rooms.
(
1
) The gaming machine coin count observation would include a weigh scale test of all denominations using pre-counted coin. The count would be in process when these tests are performed, and would be conducted prior to the commencement of any other walk-through procedures. For computerized weigh scales, the test can be conducted at the conclusion of the count, but before the final totals are generated.
(
2
) The checklists should provide for drop/count observations, inclusive of hard drop/count, soft drop/count and currency acceptor drop/count. The count room would not be entered until the count is in process and the CPA would not leave the room until the monies have been counted and verified to the count sheet by the CPA and accepted into accountability. If the drop teams are unaware of the drop observations and the count observations would be unexpected, the hard count and soft count rooms may be entered simultaneously. Additionally, if the gaming machine currency acceptor count begins immediately after the table games count in the same location, by the same count team, and using the same equipment, the currency acceptor count observation can be conducted on the same day as the table games count observation, provided the CPA remains until monies are transferred to the vault/cashier.
(B) Observations of the gaming operation's employees as they perform their duties.
(C) Interviews with the gaming operation's employees who perform the relevant procedures.
(D) Compliance testing of various documents relevant to the procedures. The scope of such testing should be indicated on the checklist where applicable.
(E) For new gaming operations that have been in operation for three months or less at the end of their business year, performance of this regulation, section 542.3(f), is not required for the partial period.
(
2
) Alternatively, at the discretion of the Tribe, the Tribe may engage an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to perform the testing, observations and procedures reflected in paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section utilizing the Tribal internal control standards adopted by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or Tribally approved variance that has received Commission concurrence. Accordingly, the CPA will verify compliance by the gaming operation with the Tribal internal control standards. Should the Tribe elect this alternative, as a prerequisite, the CPA will perform the following:
(i) The CPA shall compare the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS to ascertain whether the criteria set forth in the MICS or Commission approved variances are adequately addressed.
(ii) The CPA may utilize personnel of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority to cross-reference the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS, provided the CPA performs a review of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority
personnel's work and assumes complete responsibility for the proper completion of the work product.
(iii) The CPA shall report each procedure discovered by or brought to the CPA's attention that the CPA believes does not satisfy paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Reliance on Internal Auditors.
(i) The CPA may rely on the work of an internal auditor, to the extent allowed by the professional standards, for the performance of the recommended procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, and for the completion of the checklists as they relate to the procedures covered therein provided that the internal audit department can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CPA that the requirements contained within § 542.22, 542.32, or 542.42, as applicable, have been satisfied.
(ii) Agreed-upon procedures are to be performed by the CPA to determine that the internal audit procedures performed for a past 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year has been properly completed. The CPA will apply the following Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's written assertion:
(A) Obtain internal audit department work-papers completed for a 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year and determine whether the CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures were included in the internal audit work-papers and all steps described in the checklists were initialed or signed by an internal audit representative.
(B) For the internal audit work-papers obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, on a sample basis, reperform the procedures included in CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures prepared by internal audit and determine if all instances of noncompliance noted in the sample were documented as such by internal audit. The CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures for the applicable Drop and Count procedures are not included in the sample reperformance of procedures because the CPA is required to perform the drop and count observations as required under paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(A) of this section of the Agreed-Upon Procedures. The CPA's sample should comprise a minimum of 3 percent of the procedures required in each CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklist or other comparable testing procedures for the gaming machine and table game departments and 5 percent for the other departments completed by internal audit in compliance with the internal audit MICS. The reperformance of procedures is performed as follows:
(
1
) For inquiries, the CPA should either speak with the same individual or an individual of the same job position as the internal auditor did for the procedure indicated in their checklist.
(
2
) For observations, the CPA should observe the same process as the internal auditor did for the procedure as indicated in their checklist.
(
3
) For document testing, the CPA should look at the same original document as tested by the internal auditor for the procedure as indicated in their checklist. The CPA need only retest the minimum sample size required in the checklist.
(C) The CPA is to investigate and resolve any differences between their reperformance results and the internal audit results.
(D) Documentation is maintained for 5 years by the CPA indicating the procedures reperformed along with the results.
(E) When performing the procedures for paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section in subsequent years, the CPA must select a different sample so that the CPA will reperform substantially all of the procedures after several years.
(F) Any additional procedures performed at the request of the Commission, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or management should be included in the Agreed-Upon Procedures report transmitted to the Commission.
(4)
Report Format.
(i) The NIGC has concluded that the performance of these procedures is an attestation engagement in which the CPA applies such Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's assertion that it is
in compliance with the MICS and, if applicable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Tribal internal control standards and approved variances, provide a level of control that equals or exceeds that of the MICS. Accordingly, the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE's), specifically SSAE 10, issued by the Auditing Standards Board is currently applicable. SSAE 10 provides current, pertinent guidance regarding agreed-upon procedure engagements, and the sample report formats included within those standards should be used, as appropriate, in the preparation of the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report. If future revisions are made to this standard or new SSAEs are adopted that are applicable to this type of engagement, the CPA is to comply with any revised professional standards in issuing their agreed upon procedures report. The Commission will provide an Example Report and Letter Formats upon request that may be used and contain all of the information discussed below:
(A) The report must describe all instances of procedural noncompliance regardless of materiality) with the MICS or approved variations, and all instances where the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's regulations do not comply with the MICS. When describing the agreed-upon procedures performed, the CPA should also indicate whether procedures performed by other individuals were utilized to substitute for the procedures required to be performed by the CPA. For each instance of noncompliance noted in the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report, the following information must be included:
(
1
) The citation of the applicable MICS for which the instance of noncompliance was noted.
(
2
) A narrative description of the noncompliance, including the number of exceptions and sample size tested.
(5)
Report Submission Requirements.
(i) The CPA shall prepare a report of the findings for the Tribe and management. The Tribe shall submit 2 copies of the report to the Commission no later than 120 days after the gaming operation's business year. This report should be provided in addition to any other reports required to be submitted to the Commission.
(ii) The CPA should maintain the work-papers supporting the report for a minimum of five years. Digital storage is acceptable. The Commission may request access to these work-papers, through the Tribe.
(6)
CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists.
In connection with the CPA testing pursuant to this section and as referenced therein, the Commission will provide CPA MICS Compliance Checklists upon request.
(g)
Enforcement of Commission Minimum Internal Control Standards.
(1) Each Tribal gaming regulatory authority is required to establish and implement internal control standards pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Each gaming operation is then required, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, to develop and implement an internal control system that complies with the Tribal internal control standards. Failure to do so may subject the Tribal operator of the gaming operation, and/or the management contractor, to penalties under 25 U.S.C. 2713.
(2) Recognizing that Tribes are the primary regulator of their gaming operation(s), enforcement action by the Commission will not be initiated under this part without first informing the Tribe and Tribal gaming regulatory authority of deficiencies in the internal controls of its gaming operation and allowing a reasonable period of time to address such deficiencies. Such prior notice and opportunity for corrective action is not required where the threat to the integrity of the gaming operation is immediate and severe.

§ 542.19
What are the minimum internal control standards for accounting?
(a) Each gaming operation shall prepare accurate, complete, legible, and permanent records of all transactions pertaining to revenue and gaming activities.
(b) Each gaming operation shall prepare general accounting records according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles on a double-entry system of accounting, maintaining detailed, supporting, subsidiary records, including, but not limited to:
(1) Detailed records identifying revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity for each gaming operation;
(2) Detailed records of all markers, IOU's, returned checks, hold checks, or other similar credit instruments;
(3) Individual and statistical game records to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop by each table game, and to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop for each type of table game, by shift, by day, cumulative month-to-date and year-to-date, and individual and statistical game records reflecting similar information for all other games;
(4) Gaming machine analysis reports which, by each machine, compare actual hold percentages to theoretical hold percentages;
(5) The records required by this part and by the Tribal internal control standards;
(6) Journal entries prepared by the gaming operation and by its independent accountants; and
(7) Any other records specifically required to be maintained.
(c) Each gaming operation shall establish administrative and accounting procedures for the purpose of determining effective control over a gaming operation's fiscal affairs. The procedures shall be designed to reasonably ensure that:
(1) Assets are safeguarded;
(2) Financial records are accurate and reliable;
(3) Transactions are performed only in accordance with management's general and specific authorization;
(4) Transactions are recorded adequately to permit proper reporting of gaming revenue and of fees and taxes, and to maintain accountability of assets;
(5) Recorded accountability for assets is compared with actual assets at reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any discrepancies; and
(6) Functions, duties, and responsibilities are appropriately segregated in accordance with sound business practices.
(d)
Gross gaming revenue computations.
(1) For table games, gross revenue equals the closing table bankroll, plus credit slips for cash, chips, tokens or personal/payroll checks returned to the cage, plus drop, less opening table bankroll and fills to the table, and money transfers issued from the game through the use of a cashless wagering system.
(2) For gaming machines, gross revenue equals drop, less fills, jackpot payouts and personal property awarded to patrons as gambling winnings. Additionally, the initial hopper load is not a fill and does not affect gross revenue. The difference between the initial hopper load and the total amount that is in the hopper at the end of the gaming operation's fiscal year should be adjusted accordingly as an addition to or subtraction from the drop for the year.
(3) For each counter game, gross revenue equals:
(i) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month or will occur in subsequent months, less money paid out during the month to patrons on winning wagers (“cash basis”); or
(ii) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month, plus money, not previously included in gross revenue, that was accepted by the gaming operation in previous months on events or games occurring in the month, less money paid out during the month to patrons as winning wagers (“modified accrual basis”).
(4) For each card game and any other game in which the gaming operation is not a party to a wager, gross revenue equals all money received by the operation as compensation for conducting the game.
(i) A gaming operation shall not include either shill win or loss in gross revenue computations.
(ii) In computing gross revenue for gaming machines, keno and bingo, the actual cost to the gaming operation of any personal property distributed as losses to patrons may be deducted from winnings (other than costs of travel, lodging, services, food, and beverages), if the gaming operation maintains detailed documents supporting the deduction.
(e) Each gaming operation shall establish internal control systems sufficient to ensure that currency (other than tips or gratuities) received from a patron in the gaming area is promptly placed in a locked box in the table, or, in the case of a cashier, in the appropriate place in the cashier's cage, or on those games which do not have a locked drop box, or on card game tables, in an appropriate place on the table, in the cash register or in another approved repository.
(f) If the gaming operation provides periodic payments to satisfy a payout resulting from a wager, the initial installment payment, when paid, and the actual cost of a payment plan, which is funded by the gaming operation, may be deducted from winnings. The gaming operation is required to obtain the approval of all payment plans from the TGRA. For any funding method which merely guarantees the gaming operation's performance, and under which the gaming operation makes payments out of cash flow (e.g. irrevocable letters of credits, surety bonds, or other similar methods), the gaming operation may only deduct such payments when paid to the patron.
(g) For payouts by wide-area progressive gaming machine systems, a gaming operation may deduct from winnings only its pro rata share of a wide-area gaming machine system payout.
(h) Cash-out tickets issued at a gaming machine or gaming device shall be deducted from gross revenue as jackpot payouts in the month the tickets are issued by the gaming machine or gaming device. Tickets deducted from gross revenue that are not redeemed within a period, not to exceed 180 days of issuance, shall be included in gross revenue. An unredeemed ticket previously included in gross revenue may be deducted from gross revenue in the month redeemed.
(i) A gaming operation may not deduct from gross revenues the unpaid balance of a credit instrument extended for purposes other than gaming.
(j) A gaming operation may deduct from gross revenue the unpaid balance of a credit instrument if the gaming operation documents, or otherwise keeps detailed records of, compliance with the following requirements. Such records confirming compliance shall be made available to the TGRA or the Commission upon request:
(1) The gaming operation can document that the credit extended was for gaming purposes;
(2) The gaming operation has established procedures and relevant criteria to evaluate a patron's credit reputation or financial resources and to then determine that there is a reasonable basis for extending credit in the amount or sum placed at the patron's disposal;
(3) In the case of personal checks, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, which would normally be acceptable as a type of identification when cashing checks, and has recorded the patron's bank check guarantee card number or credit card number, or has satisfied
paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;
(4) In the case of third-party checks for which cash, chips, or tokens have been issued to the patron, or which were accepted in payment of another credit instrument, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, normally accepted as a means of identification when cashing checks, and has, for the check's maker or drawer, satisfied paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;
(5) In the case of guaranteed drafts, procedures should be established to ensure compliance with the issuance and acceptance procedures prescribed by the issuer;
(6) The gaming operation has established procedures to ensure that the credit extended is appropriately documented, not least of which would be the patron's identification and signature attesting to the authenticity of the individual credit transactions. The authorizing signature shall be obtained at the time credit is extended.
(7) The gaming operation has established procedures to effectively document its attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. Such documentation would include, but not be limited to, letters sent to the patron, logs of personal or telephone conversations, proof of presentation of the credit instrument to the patron's bank for collection, settlement agreements, or other documents which demonstrate that the gaming operation has made a good faith attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. Such records documenting collection efforts shall be made available to the TGRA or the commission upon request.
(k) Maintenance and preservation of books, records and documents. (1) All original books, records and documents pertaining to the conduct of wagering activities shall be retained by a gaming operation in accordance with the following schedule. A record that summarizes gaming transactions is sufficient, provided that all documents containing an original signature(s) attesting to the accuracy of a gaming related transaction are independently preserved. Original books, records or documents shall not include copies of originals, except for copies that contain original comments or notations on parts of multi-part forms. The following original books, records and documents shall be retained by a gaming operation for a minimum of five (5) years:
(i) Casino cage documents;
(ii) Documentation supporting the calculation of table game win;
(iii) Documentation supporting the calculation of gaming machine win;
(iv) Documentation supporting the calculation of revenue received from the games of keno, pari-mutuel, bingo, pull-tabs, card games, and all other gaming activities offered by the gaming operation;
(v) Table games statistical analysis reports;
(vi) Gaming machine statistical analysis reports;
(vii) Bingo, pull-tab, keno and pari-mutuel wagering statistical reports;
(viii) Internal audit documentation and reports;
(ix) Documentation supporting the write-off of gaming credit instruments and named credit instruments;
(x) All other books, records and documents pertaining to the conduct of wagering activities that contain original signature(s) attesting to the accuracy of the gaming related transaction.

(5) Write protected hard disks are permitted if the hardware means of enabling the write protect is easily viewable and can be sealed in place. Write protected hard disks are permitted using software write protection verifiable by a testing laboratory.
(c)
Writable and rewritable program storage media.
(1) Writable and rewritable program storage, such as hard disk drives, Flash memory, writable CD-ROMs, and writable DVDs, may be used provided that the software stored thereon may be verified using the mechanism provided pursuant to § 547.8(f).
(2) Program storage must be structured so there is a verifiable separation of fixed data (such as program, fixed parameters, DLLs) and variable data.
(d)
Identification of program storage media.
All program storage media that is not rewritable in circuit, (EPROM, CD-ROM) must be uniquely identified, displaying:
(1) Manufacturer;
(2) Program identifier;
(3) Program version number(s); and

§ 547.14
What are the minimum technical standards for electronic random number generation?
(a)
Properties.
All RNGs must produce output having the following properties:
(1) Statistical randomness;
(2) Unpredictability; and
(3) Non-repeatability.
(b)
Statistical randomness.
(1) Numbers or other designations produced by an RNG must be statistically random individually and in the permutations and combinations used in the application under the rules of the game. For example, if a bingo game with 75 objects with numbers or other designations has a progressive winning pattern of the five numbers or other designations on the bottom of the card, and the winning of this prize is defined to be the five numbers or other designations that are matched in the first five objects drawn, the likelihood of each of the 75C5 combinations are to be verified to be statistically equal.
(2) Numbers or other designations produced by an RNG must pass the statistical tests for randomness to a 99% confidence level, which may include:
(i) Chi-square test;
(ii) Runs test (patterns of occurrences must not be recurrent); and
(iii) Serial correlation test potency and degree of serial correlation (outcomes must be independent from the previous game).
(iv) Equi-distribution (frequency) test;
(v) Gap test;
(vi) Poker test;
(vii) Coupon collector's test;
(viii) Permutation test;
(ix) Spectral test; or
(x) Test on subsequences.
(c)
Unpredictability.
(1) It must not be feasible to predict future outputs of an RNG, even if the algorithm and the past sequence of outputs are known.
(2) Unpredictability must be ensured by reseeding or by continuously cycling the RNG, and by providing a sufficient number of RNG states for the applications supported.
(3) Re-seeding may be used where the re-seeding input is at least as statistically random as, and independent of, the output of the RNG being re-seeded.
(d)
Non-repeatability.
The RNG may not be initialized to reproduce the same output stream that it has produced before, nor may any two instances of an RNG produce the same stream as each other. This property must be ensured by initial seeding that comes from:
(1) A source of “true” randomness, such as a hardware random noise generator; or
(2) A combination of timestamps, parameters unique to a Class II gaming system, previous RNG outputs, or other, similar method.
(e)
General requirements.
(1) Software that calls an RNG to derive game outcome events must immediately use the output returned in accordance with the game rules.
(2) The use of multiple RNGs is permitted as long as they operate in accordance with this section.
(3) RNG outputs must not be arbitrarily discarded or selected.
(4) Where a sequence of outputs is required, the whole of the sequence in the order generated must be used in accordance with the game rules.
(5) The Class II gaming system must neither adjust the RNG process or game outcomes based on the history of prizes obtained in previous games nor use any reflexive software or secondary decision that affects the results shown to the player or game outcome.
(f)
Scaling algorithms and scaled numbers.
An RNG that provides output scaled to given ranges must:
(1) Be independent and uniform over the range;
(2) Provide numbers scaled to the ranges required by game rules, and notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, may discard numbers that do not map uniformly onto the required range but must use the first number in sequence that does map correctly to the range;
(3) Be capable of producing every possible outcome of a game according to its rules; and
(4) Use an unbiased algorithm. A scaling algorithm is considered to be unbiased if the measured bias is no greater than 1 in 50 million.
§ 547.15
What are the minimum technical standards for electronic data communications between system components?
(a)
Sensitive data.
Communication of sensitive data must be secure from eavesdropping, access, tampering, intrusion or alteration unauthorized by
the TGRA. Sensitive data includes, but is not limited to:
(1) RNG seeds and outcomes;
(2) Encryption keys, where the implementation chosen requires transmission of keys;
(3) PINs;
(4) Passwords;
(5) Financial instrument transactions;
(6) Transfers of funds;
(7) Player tracking information;
(8) Download Packages; and
(9) Any information that affects game outcome.
(b)
Wireless communications.
(1) Wireless access points must not be accessible to the general public.
(2) Open or unsecured wireless communications are prohibited.
(3) Wireless communications must be secured using a methodology that makes eavesdropping, access, tampering, intrusion or alteration impractical. By way of illustration, such methodologies include encryption, frequency hopping, and code division multiplex access (as in cell phone technology).
(c) Methodologies must be used that will ensure the reliable transfer of data and provide a reasonable ability to detect and act upon any corruption of the data.
(d) Class II gaming systems must record detectable, unauthorized access or intrusion attempts.
(e) Remote communications may only be allowed if authorized by the TGRA. Class II gaming systems must have the ability to enable or disable remote access, and the default state must be set to disabled.
(f) Failure of data communications must not affect the integrity of critical memory.
(g) The Class II gaming system must log the establishment, loss, and re-establishment of data communications between sensitive Class II gaming system components.
§ 547.16
What are the minimum standards for game artwork, glass, and rules?
(a)
Rules, instructions, and prize schedules, generally.
The following must at all times be displayed or made readily available to the player upon request:
(1) Game name, rules, and options such as the purchase or wager amount stated clearly and unambiguously;
(2) Denomination;
(3) Instructions for play on, and use of, the player interface, including the functions of all buttons; and
(4) A prize schedule or other explanation, sufficient to allow a player to determine the correctness of all prizes awarded, including:
(i) The range and values obtainable for any variable prize;
(ii) Whether the value of a prize depends on the purchase or wager amount; and
(iii) The means of division of any pari-mutuel prizes; but
(iv) For Class II Gaming Systems, the prize schedule or other explanation need not state that subsets of winning patterns are not awarded as additional prizes (for example, five in a row does not also pay three in a row or four in a row), unless there are exceptions, which must be clearly stated.
(b)
Disclaimers.
The Player Interface must continually display:
(1) “Malfunctions void all prizes and plays” or equivalent; and
(2) “Actual Prizes Determined by Bingo (or other applicable Class II game) Play. Other Displays for Entertainment Only” or equivalent.
(c)
Odds notification.
If the odds of winning any advertised top prize exceeds 100 million to one, the Player Interface must display: “Odds of winning the advertised top prize exceeds 100 million to one” or equivalent.
§ 547.17
How does a TGRA apply to implement an alternate minimum standard to those required by this part?
(a)
TGRA approval.
(1) A TGRA may approve an alternate standard from those required by this part if it has determined that the alternate standard will achieve a level of security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace. A gaming operation may implement an alternate standard upon TGRA approval subject to the Chair's decision pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) For each enumerated standard for which the TGRA approves an alternate standard, it must submit to the Chair
within 30 days a detailed report, which must include the following:
(i) An explanation of how the alternate standard achieves a level of security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace; and
(ii) The alternate standard as approved and the record on which the approval is based.
(3) In the event that the TGRA or the tribe's government chooses to submit an alternate standard request directly to the Chair for joint government to government review, the TGRA or tribal government may do so without the approval requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Chair review.
(1) The Chair may approve or object to an alternate standard approved by a TGRA.
(2) If the Chair approves the alternate standard, the Tribe may continue to use it as authorized by the TGRA.
(3) If the Chair objects to the alternate standard, the operation may no longer use the alternate standard and must follow the relevant technical standard set forth in this part.
(4) Any objection by the Chair must be in written form with an explanation why the alternate standard as approved by the TGRA does not provide a level of security or integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.
(5) If the Chair fails to approve or object in writing within 60 days after the date of receipt of a complete submission, the alternate standard is considered approved by the Chair. The Chair may, upon notification to the TGRA, extend this deadline an additional 60 days.
(c)
Appeal of Chair decision.
A TGRA may appeal the Chair's decision pursuant to 25 CFR chapter III, subchapter H.

§ 573.1
What is the purpose of this part?
Voluntary compliance is the goal of the Commission. Voluntary compliance is achieved when a tribe and the NIGC staff are able to resolve any potential enforcement issues prior to the Chair issuing an enforcement action. This part sets forth efforts for achieving voluntary compliance and enforcement action when voluntary compliance is not forthcoming. While this part is intended to garner voluntary compliance through a graduated enforcement process, there may be circumstances under which a graduated enforcement process is omitted and an enforcement action must be taken. This part also sets forth general rules governing the Commission's enforcement of the Act, this chapter, and tribal ordinances and resolutions approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. Civil fines in connection with notices of violation issued under this part are addressed in part 575 of this chapter.
[77 FR 47518, Aug. 9, 2012, as amended at 80 FR 31995, June 5, 2015]
§ 573.2
When may a letter of concern be issued?
(a) Prior to the Chair taking an enforcement action, a letter of concern may be provided by NIGC staff, detailing concerns regarding compliance with the Act, this chapter, or any tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. A letter of concern describes the available facts and information, includes a preliminary assessment regarding the incident or condition, and indicates that it may be a violation.
(b) Action under this section does not constitute agency action.
(c) A letter of concern issued under paragraph (a) of this section must provide a time period for the respondent to respond. If the letter of concern is resolved without enforcement action, NIGC staff may send an investigation completion letter pursuant to § 571.4 of this chapter.
(d) The Chair's discretion to take an enforcement action is not limited or constrained in any way by this section. When the Chair takes enforcement action before a letter of concern is issued, the enforcement action must state the reasons for moving directly to an enforcement action without first issuing a letter of concern.
[77 FR 47519, Aug. 9, 2012, as amended at 78 FR 4324, Jan. 22, 2013; 80 FR 31995, June 5, 2015]
§ 573.3
Notice of violation.
(a) The Chair may issue a notice of violation to any person for violations of any provision of the Act or this chapter, or of any tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter.
(b) A notice of violation shall contain:
(1) A citation to the federal or tribal requirement that has been or is being violated;
(2) A description of the circumstances surrounding the violation, set forth in common and concise language;
(3) Measures required to correct the violation;
(4) A reasonable time for correction, if the respondent cannot take measures to correct the violation immediately; and
(5) Notice of rights of appeal.

When may the Chair issue an order of temporary closure?
(a)
When an order of temporary closure may issue.
Simultaneously with or subsequently to the issuance of a notice of violation under § 573.3, the Chair may issue an order of temporary closure of all or part of an Indian gaming operation if one or more of the following substantial violations are present:

(13) A gaming facility operates on Indian lands not eligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
(b)
Order effective upon service.

Informal expedited review.
Within seven (7) days after service of an order of temporary closure, the respondent may request, orally or in writing, informal expedited review by the Chair.
(1) The Chair shall complete the expedited review provided for by this paragraph within two (2) days after his or her receipt of a timely request.
(2) The Chair shall, within two (2) days after the expedited review provided for by this paragraph:
(i) Decide whether to continue an order of temporary closure; and
(ii) Provide the respondent with an explanation of the basis for the decision.
(3) Whether or not a respondent seeks informal expedited review under this paragraph, within thirty (30) days after the Chair serves an order of temporary closure the respondent may appeal the order to the Commission under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter. Otherwise,
the order shall remain in effect unless rescinded by the Chair for good cause.

§ 575.1
Scope.
This part addresses the assessment of civil fines under section 2713(a) of the Act with respect to notices of violation issued under § 573.3 of this chapter.
§ 575.3
How assessments are made.
The Chairman shall review each notice of violation and order of temporary closure in accordance with § 575.4 of this part to determine whether a civil fine will be assessed, the amount of the fine, and, in the case of continuing violations, whether each daily illegal act or omission will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of the total civil fine assessed.
§ 575.4
When civil fine will be assessed.
The Chairman may assess a civil fine, not to exceed $65,655 per violation, against a tribe, management contractor, or individual operating Indian gaming for each notice of violation issued under § 573.3 of this chapter after considering the following factors:
(a)
Economic benefit of noncompliance.
The Chairman shall consider the extent to which the respondent obtained an economic benefit from the noncompliance that gave rise to a notice of violation, as well as the likelihood of escaping detection.
(1) The Chairman may consider the documented benefits derived from the noncompliance, or may rely on reasonable assumptions regarding such benefits.
(2) If noncompliance continues for more than one day, the Chairman may treat each daily illegal act or omission as a separate violation.
(b)
Seriousness of the violation.
The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine to reflect the seriousness of the violation. In doing so, the Chairman shall consider the extent to which the violation threatens the integrity of Indian gaming.
(c)
History of violations.
The Chairman may adjust a civil fine by an amount that reflects the respondent's history of violations over the preceding five (5) years.
(1) A violation cited by the Chairman shall not be considered unless the associated notice of violation is the subject of a final order of the Commission and has not been vacated; and
(2) Each violation shall be considered whether or not it led to a civil fine.
(d)
Negligence or willfulness.
The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of fault of the respondent in causing or failing to correct the violation, either through act or omission.
(e)
Good faith.
The Chairman may reduce the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of good faith of the respondent in attempting to achieve
rapid compliance after notification of the violation.

§ 575.5
Procedures for assessment of civil fines.
(a) Within 15 days after service of a notice of violation, or such longer period as the Chairman may grant for good cause, the respondent may submit written information about the violation to the Chairman. The Chairman shall consider any information so submitted in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the civil fine.
(b) The Chairman shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment on the respondent within thirty (30) days after the notice of violation was issued, when practicable.
(c) The Chairman may review and reassess any civil fine if necessary to consider facts that were not reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment.
§ 575.6
Settlement, reduction, or waiver of civil fine.
(a)
Reduction or waiver.
(1) Upon written request of a respondent received at any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the Chairman may reduce or waive a civil fine if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in a particular case, the fine is demonstrably unjust.
(2) All petitions for reduction or waiver shall contain:
(i) A detailed description of the violation that is the subject of the fine;
(ii) A detailed recitation of the facts that support a finding that the fine is demonstrably unjust, accompanied by underlying documentation, if any; and
(iii) A declaration, signed and dated by the respondent and his or her counsel or representative, if any, as follows: Under penalty of perjury, I declare that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the representations made in this petition are true and correct.
(3) The Chairman shall serve the respondent with written notice of his or her determination under paragraph (a) of this section, including a statement of the grounds for the Chairman's decision.
(b)
Settlement.
At any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the Chairman and the respondent may agree to settle an enforcement action, including the amount of the associated civil fine.

(c) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment is warranted, the presiding official shall so inform all parties.
(d) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment is warranted, a party to a proceeding may request that the presiding official direct the person submitting the confidential information to provide that information to the party.

Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall have the habitations and/or improvements appraised to its satisfaction and will attempt to assure that the owner or his designated representative is contacted in advance of the appraisal(s) and given an opportunity to accompany each appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.
(b)
Determination and offer of fair market value.
Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall establish an amount which it believes is fair market value for improvements. This amount shall be based on a current appraisal at the time negotations commence for the Relocation Contract between the NHIRC and the relocatee. The appraisal will be adjusted according to the Boeckh Building Cost Modifier for time or any physical changes in the improvements. If any changes are necessary the appraisal will be corrected to reflect a current dollar value. The amount of the current appraisal will be offered as just compensation for the improvements acquired, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A copy of the initial appraisal will be sent to the owner as soon as possible after the appraisal program is completed.
(c)
Basic negotiation procedures.
The Commission will attempt to meet with the owner or his/her representative to discuss its offer to purchase his/her property including the basis for the determination of fair market value and explain acquisition policies and procedures, including payment of incidental expenses. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to present material which he/she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property
and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Commission shall consider the owner's presentation.
(d) If the condition of the property indicates the need for a new appraisal or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the latest appraisal of the property, the Commission shall have the appraisal updated or obtain a new appraisal. If a new appraisal is for a lesser value than the previous appraisal and said lesser value is due to damage done to the property during the time between the two appraisals, and such damage was not caused by the owner of the improvement, the owner shall be entitled to the higher appraisal value.
(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Objection to determination of fair market value.
If the owner objects to the Commission's determination of fair market value, the owner may request a hearing pursuant to the Commission's Hearing and Administrative Review procedures;
(g)
Payment before taking possession.
Before requiring an owner to surrender possession of his habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall—
(1) Apply the agreed purchase price towards the acquisition price of the replacement dwelling or;
(2) Deposit with the court in an appropriate proceeding, such as divorce or probate, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the Commission's determination of fair market value for the property or the court award of compensation for the property up to the maximum benefit allowed under the then existing replacement housing benefit.
§ 700.115
Preliminary acquisition notice.
As soon as feasible in the acquisition process, the Commission shall issue a preliminary acquisition notice to the owner. The notice shall—
(a) Inform the owner of the Commission's interest in acquiring his/her habitations and/or improvements.

(a)
General.

(2) The fair market value estimate set forth in the agency's approved appraisal, if the property is valued at $2,000 or less.
(b)
Owner retention of improvements.
If the owner of a habitation and/or improvement is permitted to retain it for removal off-site, the amount determined to be just compensation for the interest in habitations and/or improvements to be acquired from him shall not be less than the amount determined by subtracting the salvage value of the improvements he retains for off-site removal from the amount determined to be fair market value for his entire interest in the habitation and improvement. Retention of improvements by the owner shall not change, alter or abrogate the requirement of the Act that the owner must move from land partitioned to the tribe of which he/she is not a member.
§ 700.121
Statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value.
At the time of the initiation of negotiations to acquire the habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall furnish the owner, along with the initial written purchase offer, a written statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value. To the extent permitted by the Commission, the statement shall include the following—
(a) A description and location identification of the habitations and/or improvements to be acquired.
(b) An inventory identifying the buildings, structures, fixtures, and other improvements, including appurtenant removable building equipment, which are considered to be part of the habitations and/or improvements for which the offer of fair market value is made.
(c) A recital of the amount of the offer and a declaration that such amount—
(1) Is the full amount believed by the Commission to be just compensation for the property and is not less than the fair market value of the property as determined on the basis of the appraisal(s);
(2) Does not reflect any relocation payments or other relocation assistance which the owner is entitled to receive.
(d) If only a portion of a habitation and/or improvement is to be acquired, an apportionment of the total estimated just compensation for the partial acquisition will be made. In the event that the Commission determines that partial acquisitions are necessary, all portions so acquired will be acquired simultaneously.
§ 700.123
Expenses incidental to transfer of ownership to the Commission.
Eligible costs.
The Commission shall reimburse the owner for reasonable expenses he/she necessarily incurred incidental to the transfer of habitations and/or improvements to the Commission.

§ 700.125
Disposal of property.
Property acquired by the Commission pursuant to the Act shall be disposed of in one of the following manners:
(a) If the Commission determines that the property acquired constitutes a substantial risk to public health and safety, the Commission may remove or destroy the property.
(b) The Commission may transfer the property acquired by gratuitous conveyance to the tribe exercising jurisdiction over the area. Notice of such transfer shall be in writing and shall be completed within sixty (60) days from the finalization of all property acquisition procedures, unless the tribe notifies the Commission in writing within that time that the property transfer is refused. In the event of a refusal by the tribe, the Commission shall remove the property.
§ 700.127
Payments for acquisition of improvements.
Payments for acquisition of improvements shall be made in the following situations:
(a) To individuals who have been denied benefits under these rules and who can prove ownership of habitations and improvements on land partitioned to the tribe of which they are not members.

(a) Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 640d-14 (d)(3) heads-of-household who do not make timely arrangements for relocation by filing an application by July 7, 1986, shall be provided a replacement home by the Commission. To be eligible for benefits (Housing and Moving Expenses), such persons must be, as of July 7, 1986, physically residing full time on land partitioned to a tribe of which they are not members and they must also otherwise meet all other current eligibility criteria.
(b) The Commission shall utilize amounts payable with respect to such households pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 640d-14(b)(2) and 25 U.S.C. 640d-34(a) for the construction or acquisition of a home and related facilities for such households.
(c) Persons identified by the Commission as potentially subject to relocation who have not applied for relocation assistance shall be contacted by the Commission as soon as practicable after July 7, 1986. At such time, the Commission shall—
(1) Request that the head-of-household choose an available area for relocation, and contract with the Commission for relocation; and
(2) Offer the relocatee suitable housing; and
(3) Offer to purchase from the head-of-household the habitation and improvements; and
(4) Offer provisions for the head-of-household and his family to be moved (e.g., moving expenses, etc.).
(d) If a person so identified fails to agree to move after the actions outlined in this section are taken by the Commission and suitable housing is available (or sufficient funds are available to assure the relocation assistance to which the relocatee may be entitled), the Commission will issue a ninety-day notice stating the date by which the person will be required to vacate the area partitioned to the Tribe of which he is not a member.
[51 FR 19170, May 28, 1986]
§ 700.139

Upon the expiration of all notice periods and upon the failure or refusal of any relocatees to make timely arrangements to move, the Commission shall forward the names and addresses of such relocatees to the Secretary of the Interior and to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona for such action as they deem appropriate. The Commission will assure the availability of relocation assistance to which the relocatees may be entitled.
§ 700.141
General requirements—claims for relocation payments.
(a)
Documentation.
Any claim for a relocation payment under subpart D, E, F, G, or H of this part shall be submitted to the Commission on the appropriate Commission form and supported by such documentation as may reasonably be required by the Commission to demonstrate expenses incurred, such as bills and receipts.
(b)
Time for filing.
All claims for a relocation payment shall be filed with the Commission within sixty (60) days after the family occupies the replacement home unless this time period is extended by the Commission.

§ 700.143
Payments for divorced or separated relocatees.
General.
The following considerations apply to certified eligible heads of household who are legally separated or divorced and intend to establish separate eligibility.
(a) Determination of benefits. Eligibility for relocation benefits is determined as of the time that the Relocation Contract is signed.
(1) If the divorce or separation took place before benefits were first applied for, the spouse who vacated the habitation will not be eligible for benefits and all relocation benefits will accrue to the spouse remaining in occupancy as head of the household remaining to be relocated.
(2) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time that benefits are first applied for, and are divorced or separated prior to signing of a Relocation Contract, both husband and wife may qualify separately for benefits if each meets the requirements of eligibility under these regulations.
(3) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time a Relocation Contract is signed but are divorced or separated prior to occupancy of the replacement dwelling, only one benefit will be paid to the household. Such benefits (including the assistance payment, moving expenses and replacement dwelling benefit) and the purchase price of the habitation and improvements may be prorated between husband and wife in such manner as they may agree in writing so long as such proration is consistent with the terms of the Relocation Contract. Such proration may also be made by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the absence of an agreement between the parties or a court order, any necessary prorations shall be made by the Commission.
(b) For purposes of this section, a head of household shall be considered as married even though living apart from his or her spouse unless legally separated under a decree or separate maintenance.
[47 FR 17988, Apr. 27, 1982]
§ 700.145
Payments to estates.
(a) Relocation benefits can be paid to the estate of a deceased Certified Eligible Head of Household under the following circumstances:
(1) If there is no household requiring relocation pursuant to the Act surviving the deceased head of household:
(i) Compensation for the habitation and other improvements owned by the deceased head of household and the cost of removing personal property from the acquired habitation and other improvements shall be paid to the estate of a deceased head of household, or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(ii) No replacement housing benefit or assistance payment (bonus) shall be paid under this circumstance.
(2) Replacement housing benefits may be paid to an estate only when a certified eligible head of household was qualified for such a housing payment pursuant to the Act and signed a Relocation Contract but died before the replacement housing was occupied. The estate of a certified eligible head of household who had not signed a Relocation Contract at the time of his/her death is not eligible for payment of a replacement housing benefit.
(b) If one of a married couple who was a certified eligible head of household dies, the surviving spouse may be paid the same relocation assistance benefits, including replacement housing payments, which the couple would have received had death not occurred. If there is no surviving spouse, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a guardian to act for minor members of the household. The Commission shall deal with such guardian and any members of the household who have attained their majority in a manner to
effect relocation of the remaining household under these regulations.
[47 FR 17988, Apr. 27, 1982]
§ 700.147
Eligibility.
(a) To be eligible for services provided for under the Act, and these regulations, the head of household and/or immediate family must have been residents on December 22, 1974, of an area partitioned to the Tribe of which they were not members.
(b) The burden of proving residence and head of household status is on the applicant.
(c) Eligibility for benefits is further restricted by 25 U.S.C. 640d-13(c) and 14(c).
(d) Individuals are not entitled to receive separate benefits if it is determined that they are members of a household which has received benefits.
(e) Relocation benefits are restricted to those who qualify as heads-of-household as of July 7, 1986.

A farm operation qualifies for a payment under this section if the Commission determines that it meets the criteria set forth in § 700.171(b)(3). In the case of a partial acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Commission determines that—
(1) The part acquired was a farm operation before the acquisition; or
(2) The partial acquisition caused the operator to be displaced from the farm operation; or
(3) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.

However, if the business or farm was not in operation for the full two taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be computed on the basis of the actual period of operation on the acquired site, projected to an annual rate. Also, average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Commission determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, his spouse, or dependents.
(b)
Documentation.
A displaced person who elects to receive a fixed payment in lieu of actual expenses incurred in moving his business or farm shall furnish the Commission proof of his net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable evidence.

(2) That permanent relocation resources are not available at the time of displacement.
(3) Prior approval of the Commission is obtained.
(4) That a Relocation Contract providing for permanent relocation has been executed.
(5) The head of household actually remained domiciled on lands partitioned to the tribe of which he is not a member as of December 22, 1974, and continuously thereafter.
(6) The head of household shall vacate all improvements owned by him on lands partitioned to the tribe of which he is not a member and shall transfer title to said improvements to the Commission.
Temporary relocation shall in no way diminish the responsibility of the Commission to offer relocation assistance and services designed to achieve permanent and suitable facilities.
(b)
Conditions under which move to temporary housing accommodations may be approved.
The move of a family or individual into temporary housing accommodations may be approved by the Commission only if the following conditions are met.

(i) It is necessary because of an emergency as determined by the Commission; or
(ii) The individual or family is subject to conditions hazardous to his or his family's health or safety.
(2) The temporary housing is decent, safe, and sanitary.
(3) The Commission shall have determined that within twelve (12) months of the date of the temporary move, replacement housing meeting Commission-approved standards will be available for occupancy by the persons temporarily rehoused.
(4) Prior to the move, the Commission shall provide in writing assurance to each head of household that:
(i) Replacement housing will be available at the earliest possible time but in any event no later than twelve (12) months from the date of the move to temporary housing.
(ii) Replacement housing will be made available on a priority basis, to the individual or family who has been temporarily rehoused.
(iii) The move to temporary rehousing will not, in any way, affect a claimant's eligibility for a replacement housing payment nor deprive him of the same choice or replacement housing units that would have been made available had the temporary move not been made.
(iv) The Commission will pay all costs in connection with the move to temporary housing, including any increased housing costs.
(c)
Agency documentation.
To request Commission approval for a temporary move of a family, the following information shall be submitted to the Commission (additional information may be required on a case-by-case basis):
(1) An explanation of the necessity for the temporary move, based upon the criteria set forth by the Commission.
(2) The estimated duration of the temporary occupancy.
(3) In the case of the family or individual, (i) a copy of the written assurance which will be provided to the person explaining his rights and the continuing obligation of the agency to provide relocation assistance, and (ii) evidence that the family or individual agrees to make the temporary move.
(d)
Costs in connection with temporary move
—(1)
Costs included.
Costs included in a temporary move may cover the following:
(i) Actual reasonable moving costs and related expenses for the move to temporary accommodations.
(ii) For the family or individual moved from a rental unit the difference, if any, between the rental cost of the dwelling vacated and the rental cost of the temporary unit.
(iii) For a homeowner who retains ownership of his dwelling the reasonable cost of renting the temporary dwelling.
(iv) For a homeowner whose dwelling has been acquired the difference, if any, between his housing costs for the acquired dwelling and the rental cost of the temporary unit.
(2)
Costs not a replacement home benefit.
Costs in connection with a move to
temporary accommodations are not to be considered as relocation payments under the Act. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)
(e)
Distinguishing between cost of temporary move and relocation payment.
The costs of a temporary move, as decribed in the foregoing subparagraphs, are not to be considered as all or a part of the relocation payment to which a displaced person is entitled under the Act. Thus, when a family is moved to temporary accommodations, a relocation payment is
not
made and the election or choice of type of payments that would ordinarily be made upon displacement must be delayed until the final move is made. When the move out of temporary accommodations is made, the displaced person shall receive the full relocation payments to which he/she is entitled pursuant to Commission regulations.

(1) The cost of the replacement site, if any; plus
(2) The moving and restoration expenses; plus
(3) The costs, if any, incurred to make the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; but not to exceed the above limitation on total replacement home benefits.

(i) Expend replacement home benefits for improvements to assure that the home meets decent, safe, and sanitary standards, and to accelerate to the maximium extent possible the achievement of debt-free home ownership, or
(ii) Expend replacement home benefits for the acquisition of a replacement dwelling as if the eligible head of household or spouse did not own a home as in paragraph (a) of this section.
(4) If the home is decent, safe, and sanitary, and is owned free and clear, no replacement home benefits will be paid.
(c) Home improvements shall include the following: General repairs, painting and texturing, fencing—including corrals, landscaping, grading, room additions, re-modeling, roofing, insulating, repair or improvements to the water, sewerage, cooling, heating, or electrical systems, storage buildings, energy conservation measures, and other home improvements as determined and defined by the Commission.

# Subpart J—Inspection of Records
§ 700.235
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart contains the regulations of the Commission implementing the requirement of subsection (a)(3) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), which provides that the Commission “upon any request for records which (1) Reasonably describes
such records and (2) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.” This subpart describes the procedures by which records may be obtained from the Commission. The procedures in this subpart are not applicable to requests for records published in the
Federal Register
or opinions in the adjudication of cases, statements of policy and interpretations and administrative staff manuals which have been published or made available under subpart A of this part.
§ 700.237
Definitions.
Act.
As used in this subpart, “Act” means the “Freedom of Information Act,” 5 U.S.C. 552.
§ 700.239
Records available.
(a)
Commission policy.
It is the policy of the Commission to make the records of the Commission available to the public to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act.
(b)
Statutory disclosure requirement.
The Freedom of Information Act requires that the Commission, on a request from a member of the public to inspect or copy records made in accordance with the procedures in this subpart, shall promptly make the records available.
(c)
Statutory exemptions.
The Act exempts nine categories of records from this disclosure requirement. The Act provides that disclosure is not required of matters that are:
(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;
(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;
(3) Specifically exempt from disclosure by statute;
(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;
(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of such records would
(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,
(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
(iv) Disclose the indentity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,
(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;
(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.
(d)
Decisions on requests.
It is the policy of the Commission to withhold information falling within an exemption only if (1) disclosure is prohibited by statute or Executive Order or (2) sound grounds exist for invocation of the exemption.
(e)
Deletion of portions of records.
If a requested record contains material within an exemption together with material not within an exemption and it is determined under the regulations in this subpart to withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt material shall be separated from the exempt material.
(f)
Creation of records.
This subpart applies only to records which exist at the time a request for records is made. Records are not required to be created in response to a request by combining
or compiling selected items from the files or by preparing a new computer program, nor are records required to be created to provide the requester with such data as proportions, percentages, frequency distributions, trends, or comparisons.
(g)
Records of concern to other departments and agencies.
(1) If the release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.
(2) If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.
(h)
Records obtained from the public.
If a requested record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the official responsible for processing the request shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, seek the views of that person or entity on whether the record should be released before making a decision on the request.
§ 700.241
Request for records.
(a)
Submission of requests.
A request to inspect or copy records shall be made to the installation where the records are located. If the records are located at more than one installation or if the specific location of the records is not known to the person wishing to inspect or copy the records, he may direct his request to the head of the appropriate bureau, or the bureau's chief public information officer, if any.
(b)
Form of request.
(1) Requests invoking the Freedom of Information Act shall be in writing.
(2)(i) A request must reasonably describe the records requested. A request reasonably describes the records requested if it will enable an employee of the Commission familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If such information is available, the request should identify the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, and the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the record, and any other information which will assist in location of the requested records. If the request involves a matter known by the requester to be in litigation, the request should also state the case name and court hearing the case.
(ii) If the description of a record sought is insufficient to allow identification and location of the record, the response denying the request on this ground shall so state and, to the extent possible, indicate what additional descriptive information, if any, would assist in location of the record.
(3) A request shall state the maximum amount of fees which the requester is willing to pay. Requesters are notified that under § 700.251, the failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated by the Commission will delay running of the time limit and delay processing of the request, if the responsible official anticipates that the fees chargeable may exceed $25.00.
(4)(i) To insure expeditious handling, requests shall be prominently marked, both on the envelope and on the face of the request, with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” The failure of a request to bear such a legend will not disqualify a request from processing under the procedures in this subpart if the request otherwise meets the requirments of this section. A request not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” will not, however, be deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in § 700.245 until it has been identified by bureau personnel as a Freedom of Information request and marked by them with this legend.
(ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the public not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” as a request otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” (B) date the request to reflect the date on which it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the request under the procedures in this subpart.
(d)
Categorical requests.
(1) A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if (i) it can be determined which particular records are covered by the request and (ii) the records can be searched for, collected and produced without unduly burdening or interfering with Commission operations because of the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of the files.
(2) If a categorical request is determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section not to reasonably describe the records requested, the response denying the request on that ground shall specify the reasons why and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with knowledgeable Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the production of the records.
§ 700.243
Action on initial requests.
(a)
Granting of requests.
(1) A requested record shall be made available if (i) the record is not exempt from disclosure or (ii) the record is exempt from disclosure, but its withholding is neither required by statute or Executive order nor supported by sound grounds.
(b)
Form of grant.
(1) When a requested record has been determined to be available, the official processing the request shall immediately notify the person requesting the record as to where and when the record is available for inspection or as the case may be, where and when copies will be available. If fees are due under § 700.251, the responsible official shall also state the amount or, if the exact amount cannot be determined, the approximate amount of fees due.
(2) If the record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the responsible official shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, notify that person or entity that the record has been made available.
(c)
Denial of requests.
(1) A request for a record may be denied only if it is determined that (i) the record is exempt from disclosure and (ii) that withholding of the record is required by statute or Executive order or supported by sound grounds.
(2) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be denied only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or by an official whom the Executive Director has in writing designated.
(d)
Form of denial.
A reply denying a request shall be in writing and shall include:
(1) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of the record;
(2) The sound ground for withholding;
(3) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial;
(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to § 700.247 and that such appeal must be in writing and be received by this official within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the denial, in the case of the denial of an entire request, or within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) of records being made available, in the case of a partial denial, by writing to the Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.
(e)
Exception.
The requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section do not apply to requests denied under § 2.14 on the ground that the request did not reasonably describe the records requested or to requests for records which do not exist.
(f)
Filing of denials.
Copies of all replies denying, in whole or part, a request for a record which are issued under this section of § 700.243 shall be promptly submitted by the Freedom of Information Act Officer, denials to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.
§ 700.245
Time limits on processing of initial requests.
(a)
Basic limit.
Requests for records shall be processed promptly. A determination whether to grant or deny a request shall be made within no more than ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of a request. This determination shall be communicated immediately to the requester.
(b)
Running of basic time limit.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the time limit commences to run when a request is received at the Commission's office in Flagstaff, Arizona.
(c)
Extensions of time.
In the following unusual circumstances, the time limit for acting upon an initial request may be extended to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, but in no case may the time limit be extended for more than ten (10) working days:
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
(d)
Authority to make extensions.
(1) An extension of time under paragraph (c) of this section may be made only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or such higher authority as the Commission has in writing designated.
(2) The person requesting the records shall be notified in writing of the extension. The written notice shall state the reason for the extension and the date on which a determination on the request is expected to be dispatched.
(3) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.
(e)
Treatment of delay as denial.
(1) If no determination has been reached at the end of the ten (10) day period for deciding an initial request, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his request denied and may exercise a right of appeal in accordance with the provisions of § 700.247.
(2) When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the responsible official shall nevertheless continue to process the request. On expiration of the time limit, the responsible official shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to treat the delay as a denial for purposes of appeal to the Commission in accordance with § 700.247. The requester may be asked to consider delaying use of his right to appeal until the date on which the determination is expected to be dispatched. If the requester so agrees, he is deemed not to have treated the failure to respond within the applicable time limit as a denial for purposes of the running of the twenty (20) working-day appeal period set out in § 700.247. If a determination of the request is not issued by the new agreed upon date, or if the request is denied in whole or part, the requester will have available his full right of appeal under § 700.247, including the entire twenty (20) working-day period for filing of the appeal.
§ 700.247
Appeals.
(a)
Right of appeal.
Where a request for records has been denied, in whole or part, the person submitting the request may appeal the denial to the Commission.
(b)
Time for appeal.
An appeal must be received no later than twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the initial denial, in the case of a denial of an entire request, or twenty (20) days
(Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after records have been made available, in the case of a partial denial.
(c)
Form of appeal.
(1) An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the original request and the initial denial and should, in order to expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to present his arguments, contain a brief statement of the reasons why the requester believes the initial denial to have been in error.
(2) The appeal shall be addressed to Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.
(3)(i) Both the envelope containing the notice of appeal and the face of the notice shall bear the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL”. The failure of an appeal to bear such a legend will not disqualify an appeal from processing under § 2.18 if the appeal otherwise meets the requirements of this section. An appeal not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL” will not, however, be deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in § 700.249 until it has been identified by Commission personnel as a Freedom of Information appeal and marked by them with this legend.
(ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the public not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL” as an appeal otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL,” (B) date the appeal to reflect the date on which it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the appeal under the procedures in this subpart.
(4) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.
§ 700.249

(b)
Time limit.
A final determination on any appeal shall be made within twenty (20) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays) after receipt of the appeal.
(c)
Extensions of time.
(1) If the time limit for responding to the initial request for a record was not extended under the provisions of § 700.245 or was extended for fewer than ten (10) working days, the time for processing of the appeal may be extended by the Executive Director to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the appeal, but in no event may the extension, when taken together with any extension made during processing of the initial request, result in an aggregate extension with respect to any one request of more than ten (10) working days. The time for processing of an appeal may be extended only if one or more of the unusual circumstances listed in § 700.245(c) requires an extension.
(2) The Executive Director shall, in writing, advise the appellant of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a final determination of the appeal is expected to be dispatched.
(3) If no determination on the appeal has been reached at the end of the twenty (20) working-day period for deciding an appeal, or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless continue to be processed. On expiration of the time limit, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to consider delaying resort to his right to judicial review until the date on which the determination on his appeal is expected to be dispatched.
(d)
Form of decision.
The final determination on an appeal shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the determination. If the determination is to release the requested records or portions thereof, the Freedom of Information Act Officer shall immediately make the records available or instruct the appropriate bureau official to make them immediately available. If the determination upholds in whole or part the initial denial of a request for records, the determination shall advise the requester of his right to obtain judicial review in the U.S. District Court for the district in which the withheld records are located, or in which the requester resides or has his principal place of business or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.
(e)
Distribution of copies.
Copies of final determinations issued by the Commission shall be provided to the Commission's legal counsel.
§ 700.251
Fees.

(2) Fees otherwise applicable for document research and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived and not charged if the request involves:
(i) Furnishing unauthenticated copies of any documents reproduced for gratuitous distribution;
(ii) Furnishing one copy of a personal document (e.g., a birth certificate) to a person who has been required to furnish it for retention by the Commission;
(iii) Furnishing one copy of the transcript of a hearing before a hearing officer in a grievance or similar proceeding to the employee for whom the hearing was held.
(3) Fees otherwise chargeable for document search and duplication costs incurred in responding to requests may be waived or reduced if the cost of collecting the fee would exceed the amount of the fee or if the request involves:
(i) Furnishing records to press, radio and television representatives for dissemination through the media to the general public;
(ii) Furnishing records to donors with respect to their gifts;
(iii) Furnishing records to individuals or private non-profit organizations having an official voluntary or cooperative relationship with the Commission to assist the individual or organization in its work with the Commission;

international organizations when to do so without charge is an appropriate courtesy, or when the recipient is carrying on a function related to that of the Commission and to do so will help to accomplish the work of the Commission;
(v) Furnishing records when to do so saves costs and yields income equal to the direct cost of providing the records (e.g., where the Commission's fee for the service would be included in a billing against the Commission);
(vi) Furnishing records when to do so is in conformance with generally established business custom (e.g., furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Commission employees);
(vii) Furnishing one copy of a record in order to assist the requester to obtain financial benefits to which he is entitled (e.g., veterans or their dependents, employees with Government employee compensation claims or persons insured by the Government).
(d)
Notice of anticipated fees and prepayment.
(1) Where it is anticipated that fees chargeable under this section may amount to more than $25.00 and the requester has not indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the request shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the time limits established by § 700.245 until the requester is advised of the fees which are anticipated and has agreed to pay these fees. Advice to requesters with respect to anticipated fees shall be provided promptly.
(2) The appropriate cases, advance payment of fees may be required before requested records are made available to the requester.
(3) A notice of anticipated fees or notice of request for advance payment shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with appropriate personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the anticipated fees and meet the needs of the requester.

The term United States or the initials “U.S.” shall not be included on the check or money order.
