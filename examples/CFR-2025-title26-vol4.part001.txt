This section provides the rules for determining the amount of the deduction allowable under section 179B(a) for qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a small business refiner to comply with the highway diesel fuel sulfur control requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This section also provides rules for making elections under section 179B.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 179B and this section, the following definitions apply:
(i) The
applicable EPA regulations
are the EPA regulations establishing the highway diesel fuel sulfur control program (40 CFR part 80, subpart I).
(ii) The
average daily domestic refinery run
for a refinery is the lesser of—
(A) The total amount of crude oil input (in barrels) to the refinery's domestic processing units during the 1-year period ending on December 31, 2002, divided by 365; or
(B) The total amount of refined petroleum product (in barrels) produced by the refinery's domestic processing units during such 1-year period divided by 365.
(iii) The
aggregate average domestic daily refinery run
for a refiner is the sum of the average daily domestic refinery runs for all refineries that were owned by the refiner or a related person on April 1, 2003.
(iv)
Cooperative owner
is a person that—
(A) Directly holds an ownership interest in a cooperative small business refiner, as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section; and
(B) Is a cooperative to which part 1 of subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applies.
(v)
Cooperative small business refiner
is a small business refiner that is a cooperative to which part 1 of subchapter T of the Code applies.
(vi)
Low sulfur diesel fuel
has the meaning prescribed in section 45H(c)(5).
(vii)
Qualified capital costs
are qualified costs as defined in section 45H(c)(2) that are properly chargeable to capital account.
(viii)
Related person
has the meaning prescribed in section 613A(d)(3) and the regulations under section 613A(d)(3).
(ix)
Small business refiner
has the meaning prescribed in section 45H(c)(1).
(b)
Section 179B deduction
—(1)
In general.
Section 179B(a) allows a deduction with respect to the qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a small business refiner (the section 179B deduction). The deduction is allowable with respect to the qualified capital costs paid or incurred during a taxable year only if the small business refiner makes an election under paragraph (d) of this section for the taxable year. The certification requirement in section 45H(e) (relating to the certification required to support a credit under section 45H) does not apply for purposes of the section 179B deduction. Accordingly, the section 179B deduction is allowable with respect to the qualified capital costs of an electing small business refiner even if the refiner never obtains a certification under section 45H(e) with respect to those costs.
(2)
Computation of section 179B deduction
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (c)(3) of this section, a small business refiner that makes an election under paragraph (d) of this section for a taxable year is allowed a section 179B deduction in an amount equal to 75 percent of qualified capital costs that are paid or incurred by the small business refiner during the taxable year.
(ii)
Reduced percentage.
A small business refiner's section 179B deduction is reduced if the refiner's aggregate average daily domestic refinery run is in excess of 155,000 barrels. In that case, the number of percentage points used in computing the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (75) is reduced (not below zero) by the product of 75 and the ratio of the excess barrels to 50,000 barrels.
(3)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) A, an accrual method taxpayer, is a small business refiner with a taxable year ending December 31. On April 1, 2003, A owns a refinery with an average daily
domestic refinery run (that is, an average daily run during calendar year 2002) of 100,000 barrels and a person related to A owns a refinery with an average daily domestic refinery run of 85,000 barrels. These are the only domestic refineries owned by A and persons related to A. A's aggregate average daily domestic refinery run for the two refineries is 185,000 barrels. A incurs qualified capital costs of $10 million in the taxable year ended December 31, 2007. The costs are incurred with respect to property that is placed in service in year 2008. A makes the election under paragraph (d) of this section for the 2007 taxable year.
(ii) Because A's aggregate average daily domestic refinery run is 185,000 barrels, the percentage of the qualified capital costs that is deductible under section 179B(a) is reduced from 75 percent to 30 percent (75 percent reduced by 75 percent multiplied by 0.6 ((185,000 barrels minus 155,000 barrels)/50,000 barrels)). Thus, for 2007, A's deduction under section 179B(a) is $3,000,000 ($10,000,000 qualified capital costs multiplied by .30).
(c)
Effect on basis
—(1)
In general.
If qualified capital costs are included in the basis of property, the basis of the property is reduced by the amount of the section 179B deduction allowed with respect to such costs.
(2)
Treatment as depreciation.
If qualified capital costs are included in the basis of depreciable property, the amount of the section 179B deduction allowed with respect to such costs is treated as a depreciation deduction for purposes of section 1245.
(d)
Election to deduct qualified capital costs
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Section 179B election.
This paragraph (d) prescribes rules for the election to deduct the qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a small business refiner during a taxable year (the section 179B election). A small business refiner making the section 179B election for a taxable year consents to, and agrees to apply, all of the provisions of section 179B and this section to qualified capital costs paid or incurred by the refiner during the taxable year. The section 179B election for a taxable year applies with respect to all qualified capital costs paid or incurred by the small business refiner during that taxable year.
(ii)
Year-by-year election.
A separate section 179B election must be made for each taxable year in which the taxpayer seeks to deduct qualified capital costs under section 179B. A small business refiner may make the section 179B election for some taxable years and not for other taxable years.
(iii)
Elections for cooperative small business refiners.
See paragraph (e) of this section for the rules applicable to the election provided under section 179B(e), relating to the election to allocate the section 179B deduction to cooperative owners of a cooperative small business refiner (the section 179B(e) election).
(2)
Time and manner for making section 179B election
—(i)
Time for making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer's section 179B election for a taxable year must be made by the due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year.
(ii)
Manner of making election
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the section 179B election for a taxable year is made by claiming a section 179B deduction on the taxpayer's original Federal income tax return for the taxable year and attaching the statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to the return. The section 179B election with respect to qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a partnership is made by the partnership and the section 179B election with respect to qualified capital costs paid or incurred by an S corporation is made by the S corporation. In the case of qualified capital costs paid or incurred by the members of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(h)), the section 179B election with respect to such costs is made for each member by the common parent of the group.
(B)
Information required in election statement.
The election statement attached to the taxpayer's return must contain the following information:
(
1
) The name and identification number of the small business refiner.
(
2
) The amount of the qualified capital costs paid or incurred during the taxable year for which the election is made.
(
3
) The aggregate average daily domestic refinery run (as determined under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section).
(
4
) The date by which the small business refiner must comply with the applicable EPA regulations. If this date is not June 1, 2006, the statement also must explain why compliance is not required by June 1, 2006.
(
5
) The calculation of the section 179B deduction for the taxable year.
(
6
) For each property that will have its basis reduced on account of the section 179B deduction for the taxable year, a description of the property, the amount included in the basis of the property on account of qualified capital costs paid or incurred during the taxable year, and the amount of the basis reduction to that property on account of the section 179B deduction for the taxable year.
(iii) Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Code, the regulations under the Code, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, a section 179B election is valid only if made at the time and in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (d)(2). For example, except as otherwise expressly provided, the 179B election cannot be made for a taxable year to which this section applies through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(3)
Revocation of election.
An election made under this paragraph (d) may not be revoked without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. To seek the Commissioner's consent, the taxpayer must submit a request for a private letter ruling (for further guidance, see, for example, Rev. Proc. 2008-1 (2008-1 IRB 1) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(4)
Failure to make election.
If a small business refiner does not make the section 179B election for a taxable year at the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no deduction is allowed for the qualified capital costs that the refiner paid or incurred during the year. Instead these qualified capital costs are chargeable to a capital account in that taxable year, the basis of the property to which these costs are capitalized is not reduced on account of section 179B, and the amount of depreciation allowable for the property attributable to these costs is determined by reference to these costs unreduced by section 179B.
(5)
Elections for taxable years ending before June 26, 2008.
This section does not apply to section 179B elections for taxable years ending before June 26, 2008. The rules for making the section 179B election for a taxable year ending before June 26, 2008 are provided in Notice 2006-47 (2006-20 IRB 892). See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter.
(e)
Election under section 179B(e) to allocate section 179B deduction to cooperative owners
—(1)
In general.
A cooperative small business refiner may elect to allocate part or all of its cooperative owners' ratable shares of the section 179B deduction for a taxable year to the cooperative owners (the section 179B(e) election). The section 179B deduction allocated to a cooperative owner is equal to the cooperative owner's ratable share of the total section 179B deduction allocated. A cooperative owner's ratable share is determined for this purpose on the basis of the cooperative owner's ownership interest in the cooperative small business refiner during the cooperative small business refiner's taxable year. If the cooperative owners' interests vary during the year, the cooperative small business refiner shall determine the owners' ratable shares under a consistently applied method that reasonably takes into account the owners' varying interests during the taxable year.
(2)
Cooperative small business refiner denied section 1382 deduction for allocated portion.
In computing taxable income under section 1382, a cooperative small business refiner must reduce its section 179B deduction for the taxable year by an amount equal to the section 179B deduction allocated under this paragraph (e) to the refiner's cooperative owners for the taxable year.
(3)
Time and manner for making election
—(i)
Time for making election.
The section 179B(e) election for a taxable year must be made by the due date (including extensions) for filing the cooperative small business refiner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year.
(ii)
Manner of making election.
The section 179B(e) election for a taxable year is made by attaching a statement to the cooperative small business refiner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year. The election statement
must contain the following information:
(A) The name and identification number of the cooperative small business refiner.
(B) The amount of the section 179B deduction allowable to the cooperative small business refiner for the taxable year (determined before the application of section 179B(e) and this paragraph (e)).
(C) The name and identification number of each cooperative owner to which the cooperative small business refiner is allocating all or some of the section 179B deduction.
(D) The amount of the section 179B deduction that is allocated to each cooperative owner listed in response to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
(4)
Irrevocable election.
A section 179B(e) election for a taxable year, once made, is irrevocable for that taxable year.
(5)
Written notice to owners.
A cooperative small business refiner that makes a section 179B(e) election for a taxable year must notify each cooperative owner of the amount of the section 179B deduction that is allocated to that cooperative owner. This notification must be provided in a written notice that is mailed by the cooperative small business refiner to its cooperative owner before the due date (including extensions) of the cooperative small business refiner's Federal income tax return for the election year. In addition, the cooperative small business refiner must report the amount of the cooperative owner's section 179B deduction on Form 1099-PATR, “Taxable Distributions Received From Cooperatives,” issued to the cooperative owner. If Form 1099-PATR is revised or renumbered, the amount of the cooperative owner's section 179B deduction must be reported on the revised or renumbered form.
(f)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after June 26, 2008.
(2)
Application to taxable years ending before June 26, 2008.
A small business refiner may apply this section to a taxable year ending before June 26, 2008, provided that the small business refiner applies all provisions in this section, with the modifications described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, to the taxable year.
(3)
Modifications applicable to taxable years ending before June 26, 2008.
The following modifications to the rules of this section apply to a small business refiner that applies those rules to a taxable year ending before
June 26, 2008
:
(i)
Rules relating to section 179B election.
The section 179B election for a taxable year ending before

(ii)
Rules relating to section 179B(e) election.
A section 179B(e) election for a taxable year ending before
June 26, 2008
will be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f) if the cooperative small business refiner has calculated its tax liability in a manner consistent with the election and has used any reasonable method consistent with the principles of section 179B(e) to inform the Internal Revenue Service that an election has been made under section 179B(e) and to inform cooperative owners of the amount of the section 179B deduction they have been allocated.
(4)
Expiration date.
The applicability of § 179B-1T expires on
June 24, 2011.
[T.D. 9404, 73 FR 36422, June 27, 2008]
§ 1.179C-1
Election to expense certain refineries.
(a)
Scope and definitions
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides the rules for determining the deduction allowable under section 179C(a) for the cost of any qualified refinery property. The provisions of this section apply only to a taxpayer that elects to apply section 179C in the manner prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 179C and this section, the following definitions apply:
(i)
Applicable environmental laws
are any applicable federal, state, or local environmental laws.
(ii)
Qualified fuels
has the meaning set forth in section 45K(c).
(iii)
Cost
is the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), but without regard to the reduction in basis for any portion of the
basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179C and this section) of the property.
(iv)
Throughput
is a volumetric rate measuring the flow of crude oil, qualified fuels, or, in the case of property placed in service after October 3, 2008, and before January 1, 2014, shale or tar sands, processed over a given period of time, typically referenced on the basis of barrels per calendar day.
(v)
Barrels per calendar day
is the amount of fuels that a facility can process under usual operating conditions, expressed in terms of capacity during a 24-hour period and reduced to account for down time and other limitations.
(vi)
United States
has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 7701(a)(9).
(b)
Qualified refinery property
—(1)
In general.
Qualified refinery property is any property that meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(7) of this section.
(2)
Description of qualified refinery property
—(i)
In general.
Property that comprises any portion of a qualified refinery may be qualified refinery property. For purposes of section 179C and this section, a qualified refinery is any refinery located in the United States that—
(A) In the case of property placed in service after August 8, 2005, and on or before October 3, 2008, is designed to serve the primary purpose of processing liquid fuel from crude oil or qualified fuels; or
(B) In the case of property placed in service after October 3, 2008, and before January 1, 2014, is designed to serve the primary purpose of processing liquid fuel from crude oil, qualified fuels, or directly from shale or tar sands.
(ii)
Nonqualified refinery property.
Refinery property is not qualified refinery property for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2) if—
(A) The primary purpose of the refinery property is for use as a topping plant, asphalt plant, lube oil facility, crude or product terminal, or blending facility; or
(B) The refinery property is built solely to comply with consent decrees or projects mandated by Federal, State, or local governments.
(3)
Original use
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the deduction allowable under section 179C(a), refinery property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, original use means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not that use corresponds to the use of the property by the taxpayer. Thus, if a taxpayer incurs capital expenditures to recondition or rebuild property acquired or owned by the taxpayer, only the capital expenditures incurred by the taxpayer to recondition or rebuild the property acquired or owned by the taxpayer satisfy the original use requirement. However, the cost of reconditioned or rebuilt property acquired by a taxpayer does not satisfy the original use requirement. Whether property is reconditioned or rebuilt property is a question of fact. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i), acquired or self-constructed property that contains used parts will be treated as reconditioned or rebuilt only if the cost of the used parts is more than 20 percent of the total cost of the property.
(ii)
Sale-leaseback.
If any new portion of a qualified refinery is originally placed in service by a person after August 8, 2005, and is sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the person, the taxpayer-lessor is considered the original user of the property.
(4)
Placed-in-service date
—(i)
In general.
Refinery property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is placed in service by the taxpayer after August 8, 2005, and before January 1, 2014.
(ii)
Sale-leaseback.
If a new portion of refinery property is originally placed in service by a person after August 8, 2005, and is sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the person, the property is treated as originally placed in service by the taxpayer-lessor not earlier than the date on which the property is used by the lessee under the leaseback.
(5)
Production capacity
—(i)
In general.
Refinery property is considered qualified refinery property if—
(A) It enables the existing qualified refinery to increase the total volume output, determined without regard to asphalt or lube oil, by at least 5 percent on an average daily basis;
(B) In the case of property placed in service after August 8, 2005, and on or before October 3, 2008, it enables the existing qualified refinery to increase the percentage of total throughput attributable to processing qualified fuels to a rate that is at least 25 percent of total throughput on an average daily basis; or
(C) In the case of property placed in service after October 3, 2008, and before January 1, 2014, it enables the existing qualified refinery to increase the percentage of total throughput attributable to processing qualified fuels, shale, or tar sands to a rate that is at least 25 percent of total throughput on an average daily basis.
(ii)
When production capacity is tested.
The production capacity requirement of this paragraph (b)(5) is determined as of the date the property is placed in service by the taxpayer. Any reasonable method may be used to determine the appropriate baseline for measuring capacity increases and to demonstrate and substantiate that the capacity of the existing qualified refinery has been sufficiently increased.
(iii)
Multi-stage projects.
In the case of multi-stage projects, a taxpayer must satisfy the reporting requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, sufficient to establish that the production capacity requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) will be met as a result of the taxpayer's overall plan.
(6)
Applicable environmental laws
—(i)
In general.
The environmental compliance requirement applies only with respect to refinery property, or any portion of refinery property, that is placed in service after August 8, 2005. A refinery's failure to meet applicable environmental laws with respect to a portion of the refinery that was in service prior to August 8, 2005 will not disqualify a taxpayer from making the election under section 179C(a) with respect to otherwise qualifying refinery property.
(ii)
Waiver under the Clean Air Act.
Refinery property must comply with the Clean Air Act, notwithstanding any waiver received by the taxpayer under that Act.
(7)
Construction of property
—(i)
In general.
Qualified property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(7) if no written binding contract for the construction of the property was in effect before June 14, 2005, and if—
(A) The construction of the property is subject to a written binding contract entered into before January 1, 2010;
(B) The property is placed in service before January 1, 2010; or
(C) In the case of self-constructed property, the construction of the property began after June 14, 2005, and before January 1, 2010.
(ii)
Definition of binding contract
—(A)
In general.
A contract is binding only if it is enforceable under state law against the taxpayer or a predecessor, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, a contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. In determining whether a contract limits damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will not be taken into account.
(B)
Conditions.
A contract is binding even if subject to a condition, as long as the condition is not within the control of either party or the predecessor of either party. A contract will continue to be binding if the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms and conditions, or if any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the control of either party. A contract that imposes significant obligations on the taxpayer or a predecessor will be treated as binding, notwithstanding the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract.
(C)
Options.
An option to either acquire or sell property is not a binding contract.
(D)
Supply agreements.
A binding contract does not include a supply or similar agreement if the payment amount and design specification of the property to be purchased have not been specified.
(E)
Components.
A binding contract to acquire one or more components of a larger property will not be treated as a binding contract to acquire the larger property. If a binding contract to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(7), the component is not qualified refinery property.
(iii)
Self-constructed property
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, if a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business (or for the production of income by the taxpayer), the construction of property rules in this paragraph (b)(7) are treated as met for qualified refinery property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after June 14, 2005, and before January 1, 2010. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section) that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business (or for the production of income) is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer.
(B)
When construction begins.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(7)(iii), construction of property generally begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances.
(C)
Components of self-constructed property
—(
1
)
Acquired components.
If a binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section) to acquire a component of self-constructed property is in effect on or before June 14, 2005, the component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, and is not qualified refinery property. However, if construction of the self-constructed property begins after June 14, 2005, the self-constructed property may be qualified refinery property if it meets all other requirements of section 179C and this section (including paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section), even though the component is not qualified refinery property. If the construction of self-constructed property begins before June 14, 2005, neither the self-constructed property nor any component related to the self-constructed property is qualified refinery property. If the component is acquired before January 1, 2010, but the construction of the self-constructed property begins after December 31, 2009, the component may qualify as qualified refinery property even if the self-constructed property is not qualified refinery property.
(
2
)
Self-constructed components.
If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component fails to meet any of the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, the component is not qualified refinery property. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component fails to meet any of the requirements provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, but the construction of the self-constructed property begins after June 14, 2005, the self constructed property may qualify as qualified refinery property if it meets all other requirements of section 179C and this section (including paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section). If the construction of the self-constructed property begins before June 14, 2005, neither the self-constructed property nor any components related to the self-constructed property are qualified refinery property. If the component was self-constructed before January 1, 2010, but the construction of the self-constructed property begins after December 31, 2009, the component may qualify as qualified refinery property, although the self-constructed property is not qualified refinery property.
(c)
Computation of expense deduction for qualified refinery property.
In general, the allowable deduction under paragraph (d) of this section for qualified refinery property is determined by
multiplying by 50 percent the cost of the qualified refinery property paid or incurred by the taxpayer.
(d)
Election
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer may make an election to deduct as an expense 50 percent of the cost of any qualified refinery property. A taxpayer making this election takes the 50 percent deduction for the taxable year in which the qualified refinery property is placed in service.
(2)
Time and manner for making election
—(i)
Time for making election.
An election specified in this paragraph (d) generally must be made not later than the due date (including extensions) for filing the original Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified refinery property is placed in service by the taxpayer.
(ii)
Manner of making election.
The taxpayer makes an election under section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) by entering the amount of the deduction at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified refinery property is placed in service, and attaching a report as specified in paragraph (f) of this section to the taxpayer's timely filed original federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified refinery property is placed in service.
(3)
Revocation of election
—(i)
In general.
An election made under section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d), and any specification contained in such election, may not be revoked except with the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
(ii)
Revocation prior to the revocation deadline.
A taxpayer is deemed to have requested, and to have been granted, the consent of the Commissioner to revoke an election under section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) if the taxpayer revokes the election before the revocation deadline. The revocation deadline is 24 months after the due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's Federal income return for the taxable year for which the election applies. An election under section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) is revoked by attaching a statement to an amended return for the taxable year for which the election applies. The statement must specify the name and address of the refinery for which the election applies and the amount deducted on the taxpayer's original Federal income tax return for the taxable year for which the election applies.

§ 1.180-1
Expenditures by farmers for fertilizer, etc.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may elect, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, to treat as deductible expenses those expenditures otherwise chargeable to capital account which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year for the purchase or acquisition of fertilizer, lime, ground limestone, marl, or other materials to enrich, neutralize, or condition land used in farming, and those expenditures otherwise chargeable to capital account paid or incurred for the application of such items and materials to such land. No election is required to be made for those expenditures which are not capital in nature. Section 180, § 1.180-2, and this section are not applicable to those expenses which are deductible under section 162 and the regulations thereunder or which are subject to the method described in section 175 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Land used in farming.
For purposes of section 180(a) and of paragraph (a) of this section, the term
land used in farming
means land used (before or simultaneously with the expenditures described in such section and such paragraph) by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock. See section 180(b). Expenditures for the initial preparation of land never previously used for farming purposes by the taxpayer or his tenant (although chargeable to capital account) are not subject to the election. The principles stated in §§ 1.175-3 and 1.175-4 are equally applicable under this section in determining whether the taxpayer is engaged in the business of farming and whether the land is used in farming.

§ 1.181-1
Deduction for qualified film and television production costs.
(a)
Deduction
—(1)
In general.
(i) An owner (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of any film or television production (production, as defined in § 1.181-3(b)) that the owner reasonably expects will be, upon completion, a qualified film or television production (as defined in § 1.181-3(a)) may elect to treat production costs paid or incurred
by that owner (subject to the limits imposed under paragraph (b) of this section) as an expense that is deductible for the taxable year in which the costs are paid (for an owner who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) or incurred (for an owner who uses an accrual method of accounting). The deduction under section 181 is subject to recapture if the owner's expectations are later determined to be inaccurate.
(ii) This section provides rules for determining the owner of a production, the production costs (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), the maximum amount of aggregate production costs (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) that may be paid or incurred for a pre-amendment production (as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) for which the owner makes an election under section 181, and the maximum amount of aggregate production costs that may be claimed as a deduction for a post-amendment production (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section) for which the owner makes an election under section 181. Section 1.181-2 provides rules for making the election under section 181. Section 1.181-3 provides definitions and rules concerning qualified film and television productions. Section 1.181-4 provides special rules, including rules for recapture of the deduction. Section 1.181-5 provides examples of the application of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-4, while § 1.181-6 provides the effective date of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-5.
(2)
Owner.
(i) For purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, an owner of a production is any person that is required under section 263A to capitalize the costs of producing the production into the cost basis of the production, or that would be required to do so if section 263A applied to that person.
(ii) Further, a person that acquires a finished or partially-finished production is treated as an owner of that production for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, but only if the production is acquired prior to its initial release or broadcast (as defined in paragraph (a)(7) of this section). Moreover, a person that acquires only a limited license or right to exploit a production, or receives an interest or profit participation in a production, as compensation for services, is not an owner of the production for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6.
(3)
Production costs.
(i) For purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, the term
production costs
means all costs that are paid or incurred by an owner in producing a production that are required, absent the provisions of section 181, to be capitalized under section 263A, or that would be required to be capitalized if section 263A applied to the owner, and, if applicable, all costs that are paid or incurred by an owner in acquiring a production prior to its initial release or broadcast. Production costs include, but are not limited to, participations and residuals paid or incurred, compensation paid or incurred for services, compensation paid or incurred for property rights, non-compensation costs, and costs paid or incurred in connection with obtaining financing for the production (for example, premiums paid or incurred to obtain a completion bond for the production).
(ii) Production costs do not include costs paid or incurred to distribute or exploit a production (including advertising and print costs).
(iii) Production costs do not include the costs to prepare a new release or new broadcast of an existing production after the initial release or broadcast of the production (for example, the preparation of a DVD release of a theatrically-released film, or the preparation of an edited version of a theatrically-released film for television broadcast). Costs paid or incurred to prepare a new release or a new broadcast of a production after its initial release or broadcast, therefore, are not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and may not be deducted under this paragraph (a).
(iv) If a pre-amendment production is acquired from any person prior to its initial release or broadcast, the acquiring person must use as its initial aggregate costs the greater of—
(A) The cost of acquisition; or
(B) The seller's aggregate production costs.
(v) Production costs do not include costs that the owner has deducted or begun to amortize prior to the taxable year the owner makes an election under § 1.181-2 for the production (for example, costs described in § 1.181-2(a)(2)). These costs, however, are included in aggregate production costs to the extent they would have been treated as production costs by the owner notwithstanding this paragraph (a)(3)(v).
(4)
Aggregate production costs.
The term
aggregate production costs
means all production costs described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section paid or incurred by any person, whether paid or incurred directly by an owner or indirectly on behalf of an owner.
(5)
Pre-amendment production.
The term
pre-amendment production
means a qualified film or television production commencing after October 22, 2004, and before January 1, 2008.
(6)
Post-amendment production.
The term
post-amendment production
means a qualified film or television production commencing on or after January 1, 2008.
(7)
Initial release or broadcast.
Solely for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-2 through 1.181-6, the term
initial release or broadcast
means the first commercial exhibition or broadcast of a production to an audience. However, the term “initial release or broadcast” does not include limited exhibition prior to commercial exhibition to general audiences if the limited exhibition is primarily for purposes of publicity, marketing to potential purchasers or distributors, determining the need for further production activity, or raising funds for the completion of production. For example, the term initial release or broadcast does not include exhibition to a test audience to determine the need for further production activity, or exhibition at a film festival for promotional purposes, if the exhibition precedes commercial exhibition to general audiences.
(8)
Special rule.
The provisions of this paragraph (a) apply notwithstanding the treatment of participations and residuals permitted under the income forecast method in section 167(g)(7)(D).
(b)
Limit on amount of aggregate production costs and amount of deduction
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Pre-amendment production.
Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no deduction is allowed under section 181 for any pre-amendment production, the aggregate production costs of which exceed $15,000,000. See also paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section. For a pre-amendment production for which the aggregate production costs do not exceed $15,000,000 (or, if applicable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, $20,000,000), an owner may deduct under section 181 all of the production costs paid or incurred by that owner.
(ii)
Post-amendment production.
Section 181 permits a deduction for the first $15,000,000 (or, if applicable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, $20,000,000) of the aggregate production costs of any post-amendment production.
(iii)
Special rules.
The owner's deduction under section 181 is limited to the owner's acquisition costs of the production plus any further production costs paid or incurred by the owner. The deduction under section 181 is not available for any portion of the acquisition costs, and any subsequent production costs, of a production with an initial release or broadcast that is prior to the date of acquisition.
(2)
Higher limit for productions in certain areas
—(i)
In general.
This section is applied by substituting $20,000,000 for $15,000,000 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any production the aggregate production costs of which are significantly paid or incurred in an area eligible for designation as—
(A) A low income community under section 45D; or
(B) A distressed county or isolated area of distress by the Delta Regional Authority established under 7 U.S.C. section 2009aa-1.
(ii)
Significantly paid or incurred for live action productions.
The aggregate production costs of a live action production are significantly paid or incurred within one or more areas specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if—
(A) At least 20 percent of the aggregate production costs paid or incurred in connection with first-unit principal photography for the production are paid or incurred in connection with
first-unit principal photography that takes place in such areas; or
(B) At least 50 percent of the total number of days of first-unit principal photography for the production consists of days during which first-unit principal photography takes place in such areas.
(iii)
Significantly paid or incurred for animated productions.
For purposes of an animated production, the aggregate production costs of the production are significantly paid or incurred within one or more areas specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if—
(A) At least 20 percent of the aggregate production costs paid or incurred in connection with keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances for the production are paid or incurred in connection with such activities that take place in such areas; or
(B) At least 50 percent of the total number of days of keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances for the production consists of days during which such activities take place in such areas.
(iv)
Significantly paid or incurred for productions incorporating both live action and animation.
For purposes of a production incorporating both live action and animation, the aggregate production costs of the production are significantly paid or incurred within one or more areas specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if—
(A) At least 20 percent of the aggregate production costs paid or incurred in connection with first-unit principal photography, keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances for the production are paid or incurred in connection with such activities that take place in such areas; or
(B) At least 50 percent of the total number of days of first-unit principal photography, keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances for the production consists of days during which such activities take place in such areas.
(v)
Establishing qualification.
An owner intending to utilize the higher aggregate production costs limit under this paragraph (b)(2) must establish qualification under this paragraph (b)(2).
(vi)
Allocation.
Solely for purposes of determining whether a production qualifies for the higher production cost limit (for pre-amendment productions) or deduction limit (for post-amendment productions) provided under this paragraph (b)(2), compensation to actors (as defined in § 1.181-3(f)(1)), directors, producers, and other relevant production personnel (as defined in § 1.181-3 (f)(2)) is allocated entirely to first-unit principal photography.
(c)
Effect on depreciation or amortization of a qualified film or television production
—(1)
Pre-amendment production.
Except as provided in §§ 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181-2(a)(2), an owner that elects to deduct production costs under section 181 for a pre-amendment production may not deduct production costs for that production under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 181 unless the recapture requirements of § 1.181-4(a) apply to the production.
(2)
Post-amendment production.
Amounts not allowable as a deduction under section 181 for a post-amendment production may be deducted under any other applicable provision of the Code.
[T.D. 9551, 76 FR 60724, Sept. 30, 2011, as amended by T.D. 9552, 76 FR 64817, Oct. 19, 2011; T.D. 9603, 77 FR 72924, Dec. 7, 2012]

Election to deduct production costs.
(a)
Election
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an owner may make an election under section 181 to deduct production costs of a production only if that owner has not deducted in a previous taxable year any production costs for that production under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) other than section 181.
(2)
Exception.
An owner may make an election under section 181 despite prior deductions under any other provision of the Code for amortization of the costs of acquiring or developing screenplays, scripts, story outlines, motion picture production rights to books and
plays, and other similar properties for purposes of potential future development or production of a production, if such costs were paid or incurred before the first taxable year for which an election may be made under § 1.181-2(b) and are included in aggregate production costs.
(b)
Time of making election
—(1)
In general.
The election to deduct production costs for a production under section 181 must be made by the due date (including any extension) for filing the owner's Federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which:

(2)
Special rule.
If paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not satisfied until a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which any aggregate production costs were first paid or incurred, the owner must make the election for the taxable year in which paragraph (b)(1) of this section is first satisfied, and any production costs paid or incurred prior to the taxable year in which the owner makes the election and not deducted in a prior taxable year are treated as production costs (except costs described in § 1.181-2(a)(2)) that are deductible under § 1.181-1(a)(1)(i) for the taxable year paragraph (b)(1) of this section is first satisfied and the election is made.
(3)
Six-month extension.
See § 301.9100-2 for a six-month extension of time to make the election in certain circumstances.
(c)
Manner of making election
—(1)
In general.

Subsequent taxable years.
If the owner pays or incurs additional production costs in any taxable year subsequent to the taxable year for which production costs are first deducted under section 181, the owner must attach a statement to its Federal income tax return for that subsequent taxable year providing—
(A) The name (or other unique identifying designation) of the production that was used in the initial election, and any revised name (or unique identifying designation) subsequently used for the production;
(B) The date the aggregate production costs were first paid or incurred for the production;
(C) The amount of aggregate production costs paid or incurred for the production during the current taxable year;
(D) The amount of qualified compensation paid or incurred for the production during the current taxable year;
(E) The amount of compensation paid or incurred for the production during the current taxable year, and the aggregate amount of compensation paid or incurred for the production in all prior taxable years;
(F) If the owner expects that the aggregate production costs of the production will be significantly paid or incurred in (or, if applicable, if a significant portion of the total number of days of first-unit principal photography will occur in) one or more of the areas specified in § 1.181-1(b)(2)(i), the identity of the area or areas, the amount of aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of first-unit principal photography engaged in) for the applicable activities described in § 1.181-1(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, that took place within such areas, and the aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of first-unit principal photography engaged in) for such activities (whether or not they took place in such areas), for the current taxable year;
(G) A declaration that the owner continues to reasonably expect (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the current taxable year) both that the production will be set for production (or has been set for production) and will be a qualified film or television production; and
(H) For any pre-amendment production, a declaration that the owner continues to reasonably expect (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the current taxable year) that the aggregate production costs paid or incurred for the pre-amendment production will not, at any time, exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit set forth under § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2).
(3)
Deductions by more than one person.
If more than one person will claim deductions under section 181 with respect to the production for the taxable year, each person claiming the deduction (but not the members of an entity who are issued a Schedule K-1 by the entity with respect to their interest in the production) must provide a list of the names and taxpayer identification numbers of all such persons, the dollar amount that each such person will deduct under section 181, and the information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section for all such persons. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, whether or not multiple persons form a partnership with respect to the production will be determined in accordance with § 301.7701-3 of this chapter.
(d)
Revocation of election
—(1)
In general.
An owner may revoke an election made under this section only with the consent of the Commissioner. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an owner seeking consent to revoke an election made under this
section must submit a letter ruling request, other than a Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” under the appropriate revenue procedure. See, for example, Rev. Proc. 2011-1, 2011-1 CB 1 (updated annually) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

§ 1.181-3
Qualified film or television production.
(a)
In general.
The term
qualified film or television production
means any production (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for which not less than 75 percent of the aggregate amount of compensation (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) paid or incurred for the production is qualified compensation (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(b)
Production
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-1, 1.181-2, 1.181-4, 1.181-5, and 1.181-6, the term
production
means any motion picture film or video tape (including digital video) production the production costs of which are subject to capitalization under section 263A, or that would be subject to capitalization if section 263A applied to the owner of the production. If, prior to its initial release or broadcast, a person acquires a completed motion picture film or video tape (including digital video) that the seller was entitled to treat as a production under this paragraph (b)(1), then the new owner may treat the acquired asset as a production within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(1).
(2)
Special rules for television productions.
Each episode of a television series is a separate production to which the rules, limits, and election requirements of this section and §§ 1.181-1, 1.181-2, 1.181-4, 1.181-5, and 1.181-6 apply. An owner may elect to deduct production costs under section 181 only for the first 44 episodes of a television series (including pilot episodes). A television series may include more than one season of programming.
(3)
Exception for certain sexually explicit productions.
A production does not include property for which records are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. 2257.
(c)
Compensation.
The term
compensation
means, for purposes of this section and § 1.181-2(c)(2), all amounts paid or incurred either directly by the owner or indirectly on the owner's behalf for services performed by actors (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), directors, producers, and other production personnel (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) for the production. Examples of indirect payments paid or incurred on the owner's behalf are payments by a partner on behalf of an owner that is a partnership, payments by a shareholder on behalf of an owner that is a corporation, and payments by a contract producer on behalf of the owner. Payments for services are all elements of compensation as provided for in §§ 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i)(B) and (e)(3)(ii)(D). Compensation is not limited to wages reported on Form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statement,” and includes compensation paid or incurred to independent contractors. However, solely for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “compensation” does not include participations and residuals (as defined in section 167(g)(7)(B)). See § 1.181-1(a)(3) for additional rules concerning participations and residuals.
(d)
Qualified compensation.
The term
qualified compensation
means, for purposes of this section and § 1.181-2(c)(2), all compensation (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) paid or incurred for services performed in the United States (as defined in paragraph
(f)(3) of this section) by actors, directors, producers, and other production personnel for the production. A service is performed in the United States for purposes of this paragraph (d) if the principal photography to which the compensated service relates occurs within the United States and the person performing the service is physically present in the United States. For purposes of an animated film or animated television production, the location where production activities such as keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances are performed is considered in lieu of the location of principal photography. For purposes of a production incorporating both live action and animation, the location where production activities such as keyframe animation, in-between animation, animation photography, and the recording of voice acting performances for the production is considered in addition to the location of principal photography.
(e)
Special rule for acquired productions.
A person who acquires a production from a prior owner must take into account all compensation paid or incurred by or on behalf of the seller and any previous owners in determining if the production is a qualified film or television production as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Any owner that elects to deduct as production costs the costs of acquiring a production and any subsequent production costs must obtain from the seller detailed records concerning the compensation paid or incurred for the production and, for a pre-amendment production, concerning aggregate production costs, in order to demonstrate the eligibility of the production under section 181.
(f)
Other definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.181-1, 1.181-2, 1.181-4, 1.181-5, and 1.181-6:
(1)

The term
actors
means players, newscasters, or any other persons who are compensated for their performance or appearance in a production.
(2)

Special rules.
(a)
Recapture
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
In general.
The requirements of this paragraph (a) apply notwithstanding whether an owner has satisfied the revocation requirements of § 1.181-2(d). An owner that claimed a deduction under section 181 for a production in any taxable year in an amount in excess of the amount that would be allowable as a deduction for that year in the absence of section 181 must recapture the excess amount as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the production in the first taxable year for which—
(A) For any pre-amendment production, the aggregate production costs of the production exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit under § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2);
(B) For any pre-amendment production, the owner no longer reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the current taxable year) that the aggregate production costs of the production will not, at any time, exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit set forth under § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2);
(C) The owner no longer reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances at the end of the current
taxable year) either that the production will be set for production or that the production will be a qualified film or television production; or
(D) The owner revokes the election pursuant to § 1.181-2(d).
(ii)
Special rule.
An owner that claimed a deduction under section 181 and disposes of the production prior to its initial release or broadcast must recapture the entire amount specified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section in the year the owner disposes of the production before computing gain or loss from the disposition.
(2)
Principal photography not commencing prior to the date of expiration of section 181.
If an owner claims a deduction under section 181 for a production for which principal photography does not commence prior to the date of expiration of section 181, the owner must recapture deductions as provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section in the owner's taxable year that includes the date of expiration of section 181.
(3)
Amount of recapture.
An owner subject to the recapture requirements under this section must, for the taxable year in which recapture is required, include in the owner's gross income as ordinary income and add to the owner's adjusted basis in the property—
(i) For a production that is placed in service in a taxable year prior to the taxable year for which recapture is required, the difference between the aggregate amount the owner claimed as a deduction under section 181 for the production for all such prior taxable years and the aggregate depreciation deductions that would have been allowable for the production for such prior taxable years (or that the owner could have elected to deduct in the taxable year that the production was placed in service) for the production under the owner's method of accounting; or
(ii) For a production that has not been placed in service, the aggregate amount claimed as a deduction under section 181 for the production for all such prior taxable years.
(b)
Recapture under section 1245.
For purposes of recapture under section 1245, any deduction allowed under section 181 is treated as a deduction allowable for amortization.
[T.D. 9551, 76 FR 60728, Sept. 30, 2011]
§ 1.181-5
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-4:

# Example 1.
X, a corporation that uses an accrual method of accounting and files Federal income tax returns on a calendar-year basis, is a producer of films. X is the owner (within the meaning of § 1.181-1(a)(2)) of film ABC. X incurs production costs in year 1, but does not commence principal photography for film ABC until year 2. In year 1, X reasonably expects, based on all of the facts and circumstances, that film ABC will be set for production and will be a qualified film or television production. Provided that X satisfies all other requirements of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-4 and § 1.181-6, X may deduct in year 1 the production costs for film ABC that X incurred in year 1.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In year 2, X begins, but does not complete, principal photography for film ABC. Most of the scenes that X films in year 2 are shot outside the United States and, as of December 31, year 2, less than 75 percent of the total compensation paid for film ABC is qualified compensation. Nevertheless, X still reasonably expects, based on all of the facts and circumstances, that film ABC will be a qualified film or television production. Provided that X satisfies all other requirements of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-4 and § 1.181-6, X may deduct in year 2 the production costs for film ABC that X incurred in year 2.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2.
In year 3, X continues, but does not complete, production of film ABC. Due to changes in the expected production costs of film ABC, X no longer expects film ABC to qualify under section 181. X files a statement with its return for year 3 identifying the film and stating that X revokes its election under section 181. X includes in income in year 3 the deductions claimed in year 1 and in year 2 as provided for in § 1.181-4(a)(3). X has successfully revoked its election pursuant to § 1.181-2(d).

§ 1.181-6
Effective/applicability date.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-5 apply to productions the first day of principal photography for which occurs on or after September 29, 2011. Paragraphs 1.181-1(a)(1)(ii), (a)(6), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(vi), and (c)(2) of § 1.181-1 apply to productions to which section 181 is applicable and for which
the first day of principal photography or in-between animation occurs on or after December 7, 2012.
(b)
Pre-effective date productions.
For any taxable year for which the period of limitation on refund or credit under section 6511 has not expired, the owner may apply §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-5 to any production to which section 181 applies and for which the first day of principal photography (or in-between animation) occurred before December 7, 2012, provided the owner applies all relevant provisions of §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-5 to the production.
[T.D. 9603, 77 FR 72924, Dec. 7, 2012]
§ 1.182-1
Expenditures by farmers for clearing land; in general.
Under section 182, a taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may elect, in the manner provided in § 1.182-6, to deduct certain expenditures paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, in the clearing of land. The expenditures to which the election applies are all expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year in clearing land for the purpose of making the “land suitable for use in farming” (as defined in § 1.182-4) which are not otherwise deductible (exclusive of expenditures for or in connection with depreciable items referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.182-3), but only if such expenditures are made in furtherance of the taxpayer's business of farming. The term
expenditures
to which the election applies also includes a reasonable allowance for depreciation (not otherwise allowable) on equipment used in the clearing of land provided such equipment, if used in the carrying on of a trade or business, would be subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. (See paragraph (c) of § 1.182-3.) (See section 175 and the regulations thereunder for deductibility of certain expenditures for treatment or moving of earth by a farmer where the land already qualifies as land used in farming as defined in § 1.175-4.) The amount deductible for any taxable year is limited to the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of the taxable income derived from farming (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.182-5) during the taxable year. Expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible under section 182 for such taxable year shall be treated as capital expenditures and shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of the land under section 1016(a).
[T.D. 6794, 30 FR 790, Jan. 26, 1965]
§ 1.182-2
Definition of “the business of farming.”
Under section 182, the election to deduct expenditures incurred in the clearing of land is applicable only to a taxpayer who is engaged in “the business of farming” during the taxable year. A taxpayer is engaged in the business of farming if he cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for gain or profit, either as owner or tenant. For purposes of section 182, a taxpayer who receives a rental (either in cash or in kind) which is based upon farm production is engaged in the business of farming. However, a taxpayer who receives a fixed rental (without reference to production) is engaged in the business of farming only if he participates to a material extent in the operation or management of the farm. A taxpayer engaged in forestry or the growing of timber is not thereby engaged in the business of farming. A person cultivating or operating a farm for recreation or pleasure rather than for profit is not engaged in the business of farming. For purposes of section 182 and this section, the term
farm
is used in its ordinary, accepted sense and includes stock, dairy, poultry, fish, fruit, and truck farms, and also plantations, ranches, ranges, and orchards. A fish farm is an area where fish are grown or raised, as opposed to merely caught or harvested; that is, an area where they are artificially fed, protected, cared for, etc. A taxpayer is engaged in “the business of farming” if he is a member of a partnership engaged in the business of farming. See § 1.702-1.
[T.D. 6794, 30 FR 790, Jan. 26, 1965]
§ 1.182-3
Definition, exceptions, etc., relating to deductible expenditures.
(a)
Clearing of land.
(1) For purposes of section 182, the term
clearing of land
includes (but is not limited to):
(i) The removal of rocks, stones, trees, stumps, brush or other natural
impediments to the use of the land in farming through blasting, cutting, burning, bulldozing, plowing, or in any other way;
(ii) The treatment or moving of earth, including the construction, repair or removal of nondepreciable earthen structures, such as dikes or levies, if the purpose of such treatment or moving of earth is to protect, level, contour, terrace, or condition the land so as to permit its use as farming land; and
(iii) The diversion of streams and watercourses, including the construction of nondepreciable drainage facilities, provided that the purpose is to remove or divert water from the land so as to make it available for use in farming.
(2) The following are examples of land clearing activities:
(i) The cutting of trees, the blasting of the resulting stumps, and the burning of the residual undergrowth;
(ii) The leveling of land so as to permit irrigation or planting;
(iii) The removal of salt or other minerals which might inhibit cultivation of the soil;
(iv) The draining and filling in of a swamp or marsh; and
(v) The diversion of a stream from one watercourse to another.
(b)
Expenditures not allowed as a deduction under section 182.
(1) Section 182 applies only to expenditures for nondepreciable items. Accordingly, a taxpayer may not deduct expenditures for the purchase, construction, installation, or improvement of structures, appliances, or facilities which are of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Expenditures in respect of such depreciable property include those for materials, supplies, wages, fuel, freight, and the moving of earth, paid or incurred with respect to tanks, reservoirs, pipes, conduits, canals, dams, wells, or pumps constructed of masonry, concrete, tile, metal, wood, or other nonearthen material.
(2) Expenditures which are deductible without regard to section 182 are not deductible under section 182. Thus, such expenditures are deductible without being subject to the limitations imposed by section 182(b) and § 1.182-5. For example, section 182 does not apply to the ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in the business of farming which are deductible under section 162 even though they might otherwise be considered to be clearing of land expenditures. Section 182 also does not apply to interest (deductible under section 163) nor to taxes (deductible under section 164). Similarly, section 182 does not apply to any expenditures (whether or not currently deductible) paid or incurred for the purpose of soil or water conservation in respect of land used in farming, or for the prevention of erosion of land used in farming, within the meaning of section 175 and the regulations thereunder, nor to expenditures deductible under section 180 and the regulations thereunder, relating to expenditures for fertilizer, etc.
(c)
Depreciation.
In addition to expenditures for the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, there also shall be treated as an expenditure to which section 182 applies a reasonable allowance for depreciation not otherwise deductible on property of the taxpayer which is used in the clearing of land for the purpose of making such land suitable for use in farming, provided the property is property which, if used in a trade or business, would be subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. Depreciation allowable as a deduction under section 182 is limited to the portion of depreciation which is attributable to the use of the property in the clearing of land. The depreciation shall be computed in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. To the extent an amount representing a reasonable allowance for depreciation with respect to property used in clearing land is treated as an expenditure to which section 182 applies, such depreciation shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, be treated as an amount allowed under section 167 for depreciation. Thus, if a deduction is allowed for depreciation under section 182 in respect of property used in clearing land, proper adjustment to the basis of the property so used shall be made under section 1016(a).
[T.D. 6794, 30 FR 791, Jan. 26, 1965]
§ 1.182-4
Definition of “land suitable for use in farming”, etc.
For purposes of section 182, the term
land suitable for use in farming
means land which, as a result of the land clearing activities described in paragraph (a) of § 1.182-3, could be used by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, including fish, or for the sustenance of livestock. The term
livestock
includes cattle, hogs, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, goats, captive fur-bearing animals, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, and other poultry. Land used for the sustenance of livestock includes land used for grazing such livestock. Expenditures are considered to be for the purpose of making land suitable for use in farming by the taxpayer or his tenant only if made to prepare the land which is cleared for use by the taxpayer or his tenant in farming. Thus, if the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures to clear land for the purpose of sale (whether or not for use in farming by the purchaser) or to be held by the taxpayer or his tenant other than for use in farming, section 182 does not apply to such expenditures. Whether the land is cleared for the purpose of making it suitable for use in farming by the taxpayer or his tenant, is a question of fact which must be resolved on the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances. For purposes of section 182, it is not necessary that the land cleared actually be used in farming following the clearing activities. However, the fact that following the clearing operation, the land is used by the taxpayer or his tenant in the business of farming will, in most cases, constitute evidence that the purpose of the clearing was to make land suitable for use in farming by the taxpayer or his tenant. On the other hand, if the land cleared is sold or converted to nonfarming use soon after the taxpayer has completed his clearing activities, there will be a presumption that the expenditures were not made for the purpose of making the land suitable for use in farming by the taxpayer or his tenant. Other factors which will be considered in determining the taxpayer's purpose for clearing the land are, for example, the acreage, location, and character of the land cleared, the nature of the taxpayer's farming operation, and the use to which adjoining or nearby land is put.

§ 1.182-5
Limitation.
(a)
Limitation
—(1)
General rule.
The amount of land clearing expenditures which the taxpayer may deduct under section 182 in any one taxable year is limited to the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of his “taxable income derived from farming”. Expenditures in excess of the applicable limitation are to be charged to the capital account and constitute additions to the taxpayer's basis in the land.
(2)
Definition of “taxable income derived from farming”.
For purposes of section 182, the term
taxable income derived from farming
means the gross income derived from the business of farming reduced by the deductions attributable to such gross income. Gross income derived from the business of farming is the gross income of the taxpayer derived from the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, including fish, or from livestock (including livestock held for draft, breeding or dairy purposes). It does not include gains from sales of assets such as farm machinery or gains from the disposition of land. The deductions attributable to the business of farming are all the deductions allowed by Chapter 1 of the Code (other than the deduction allowed by section 182) for expenditures or charges (including depreciation and amortization) paid or incurred in connection with the production or raising of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, including fish, or livestock. However, the deduction under section 1202 (relating to the capital gains deduction) attributable to gain on the sale or other disposition of assets (other than draft, breeding, or dairy stock), and the net operating loss deduction (computed under section 172) shall not be taken into account in computing “taxable income derived from farming.” Similarly, deductible losses on the sale, disposition, destruction, condemnation, or abandonment of assets (other than draft, breeding, or dairy stock) shall not be considered as deductions attributable to the business of farming. A taxpayer shall compute
his gross income from farming in accordance with his accounting method used in determining gross income. (See the regulations under section 61 relating to accounting methods used by farmers in determining gross income.)
(b)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

A's “taxable income derived from farming” for purposes of section 182 is $5,750; income of $18,500 ($23,700−$5,200), less deductions of $12,750 ($16,950−$4,200). A may deduct $1,437.50 (25% of $5,750) under section 182. The excess expenditures in the amount of $562.50 are to be charged to capital account and serve to increase the taxpayer's basis of the land.

and in addition, assume that A is allowed a deduction for a net operating loss carryback from the taxable year 1966 in the amount of $3,000. The net operating loss deduction will not be taken into account in computing A's “taxable income derived from farming” for 1963 Accordingly, A will not be required to recompute such taxable income for purposes of applying the limitation on the deduction provided in section 182 and the deduction of $1,437.50 will not be reduced.

§ 1.182-6
Election to deduct land clearing expenditures.
(a)
Manner of making election.
The election to deduct expenditures for land clearing provided by section 182(a) shall be made by means of a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which such election is to apply. The statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year for which the election is to apply. The statement shall also set forth the amount and description of the expenditures for land clearing claimed as a deduction under section 182, and shall include a computation of “taxable income derived from farming”, if the amount of such income is not the same as the net income from farming shown on Schedule F of Form 1040, increased by the amount of the deduction claimed under section 182.
(b)
Scope of election.
An election under section 182(a) shall apply only to the taxable year for which made. However, once made, an election applies to all expenditures described in § 1.182-3 paid or incurred during the taxable year, and is binding for such taxable year unless the district director consents to a revocation of such election. Requests for consent to revoke an election under section 182 shall be made by
means of a letter to the district director for the district in which the taxpayer is required to file his return, setting forth the taxpayer's name, address and identification number, the year for which it is desired to revoke the election, and the reasons therefor. However, consent will not be granted where the only reason therefor is a change in tax consequences.
[T.D. 6794, 30 FR 791, Jan. 26, 1965]
§ 1.183-1
Activities not engaged in for profit.
(a)
In general.
Section 183 provides rules relating to the allowance of deductions in the case of activities (whether active or passive in character) not engaged in for profit by individuals and electing small business corporations, creates a presumption that an activity is engaged in for profit if certain requirements are met, and permits the taxpayer to elect to postpone determination of whether such presumption applies until he has engaged in the activity for at least 5 taxable years, or, in certain cases, 7 taxable years. Whether an activity is engaged in for profit is determined under section 162 and section 212 (1) and (2) except insofar as section 183(d) creates a presumption that the activity is engaged in for profit. If deductions are not allowable under sections 162 and 212 (1) and (2), the deduction allowance rules of section 183(b) and this section apply. Pursuant to section 641(b), the taxable income of an estate or trust is computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual, with certain exceptions not here relevant. Accordingly, where an estate or trust engages in an activity or activities which are not for profit, the rules of section 183 and this section apply in computing the allowable deductions of such trust or estate. No inference is to be drawn from the provisions of section 183 and the regulations thereunder that any activity of a corporation (other than an electing small business corporation) is or is not a business or engaged in for profit. For rules relating to the deductions that may be taken into account by taxable membership organizations which are operated primarily to furnish services, facilities, or goods to members, see section 277 and the regulations thereunder. For the definition of an activity not engaged in for profit, see § 1.183-2. For rules relating to the election contained in section 183(e), see § 1.183-3.
(b)
Deductions allowable
—(1)
Manner and extent.
If an activity is not engaged in for profit, deductions are allowable under section 183(b) in the following order and only to the following extent:
(i) Amounts allowable as deductions during the taxable year under Chapter 1 of the Code without regard to whether the activity giving rise to such amounts was engaged in for profit are allowable to the full extent allowed by the relevant sections of the Code, determined after taking into account any limitations or exceptions with respect to the allowability of such amounts. For example, the allowability-of-interest expenses incurred with respect to activities not engaged in for profit is limited by the rules contained in section 163(d).
(ii) Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions during the taxable year under Chapter 1 of the Code, but only if such allowance does not result in an adjustment to the basis of property, determined as if the activity giving rise to such amounts was engaged in for profit, are allowed only to the extent the gross income attributable to such activity exceeds the deductions allowed or allowable under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iii) Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions for the taxable year under Chapter 1 of the Code which result in (or if otherwise allowed would have resulted in) an adjustment to the basis of property, determined as if the activity giving rise to such deductions was engaged in for profit, are allowed only to the extent the gross income attributable to such activity exceeds the deductions allowed or allowable under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph. Deductions falling within this subdivision include such items as depreciation, partial losses with respect to property, partially worthless debts, amortization, and amortizable bond premium.
(2)
Rule for deductions involving basis adjustments
—(i)
In general.
If deductions are allowed under subparagraph
(1)(iii) of this paragraph, and such deductions are allowed with respect to more than one asset, the deduction allowed with respect to each asset shall be determined separately in accordance with the computation set forth in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Basis adjustment fraction.
The deduction allowed under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph is computed by multiplying the amount which would have been allowed, had the activity been engaged in for profit, as a deduction with respect to each particular asset which involves a basis adjustment, by the basis adjustment fraction:
(
a
) The numerator of which is the total of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, and
(
b
) The denominator of which is the total of deductions which involve basis adjustments which would have been allowed with respect to the activity had the activity been engaged in for profit.
The amount resulting from this computation is the deduction allowed under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph with respect to the particular asset. The basis of such asset is adjusted only to the extent of such deduction.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an individual, maintains a herd of dairy cattle, which is an “activity not engaged in for profit” within the meaning of section 183(c). A sold milk for $1,000 during the year. During the year A paid $300 State taxes on gasoline used to transport the cows, milk, etc., and paid $1,200 for feed for the cows. For the year A also had a casualty loss attributable to this activity of $500. A determines the amount of his allowable deductions under section 183 as follows:
(i) First, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph as follows:
State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section 164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for profit
$300
Casualty loss specifically allowed under section 165(c)(3) without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for profit ($500 less $100 limitation)
400
Deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph
700
(ii) Second, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowed under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and which do not involve basis adjustments) as follows:
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph:
Income from milk sales
$1,000
Gross income from activity
1,000
Less: deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph
700
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph
300
Feed for cows
1,200
Deduction allowed under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph
300
$900 of the feed expense is not allowed as a deduction under section 183 because the total feed expense ($1,200) exceeds the maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph ($300). In view of these circumstances, it is not necessary to determine deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph which would be allowable under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and which involve basis adjustment (the $100 of casualty loss not allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph because of the limitation in section 165(c)(3)) because none of such amount will be allowed as a deduction under section 183.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A also had income from sales of hay grown on the farm of $1,200 and that depreciation of $750 with respect to a barn, and $650 with respect to a tractor would have been allowed with respect to the activity had it been engaged in for profit. A determines the amount of his allowable deductions under section 183 as follows:
(i) First, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph as follows:
State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section 164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for profit
$300
Casualty loss specifically allowed under section 165(c)(3) without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for profit ($500 less $100 limitation)
400
Deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph
700
(ii) Second, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowable under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and which do not involve basis adjustments) as follows:
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph:
Income from milk sales
$1,000
Income from hay sales
1,200
Gross income from activity
2,200
Less: deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph
700
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph
1,500
Feed for cows
1,200
The entire $1,200 of expenses relating to feed for cows is allowable as a deduction under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, since it does not exceed the maximum amount of deductions allowable under such subparagraph.
(iii) Last, A computes the deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowable under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and which involve basis adjustments) as follows:
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph:
Gross income from farming
$2,200
Less: Deductions allowed under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph
$700
Deductions allowed under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph
1,200
1,900
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph
300
(iv) Since the total of A's deductions under chapter 1 of the Code (determined as if the activity was engaged in for profit) which involve basis adjustments ($750 with respect to barn, $650 with respect to tractor, and $100 with respect to limitation on casualty loss) exceeds the maximum amount of the deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph ($300), A computes his allowable deductions with respect to such assets as follows:
A first computes his basis adjustment fraction under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph as follows:
The numerator of the fraction is the maximum of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph which involve basis adjustments
$300
The denominator of the fraction is the total of deductions that involve basis adjustments which would have been allowed with respect to the activity had the activity been engaged in for profit
1,500
The basis adjustment fraction is then applied to the amount of each deduction which would have been allowable if the activity were engaged in for profit and which involves a basis adjustment as follows:
Depreciation allowed with respect to barn (300/1,500 × $750)
$150
Depreciation allowed with respect to tractor (300/1,500 × $650)
130
Deduction allowed with respect to limitation on casualty loss (300/1,500 × $100)
20
The basis of the barn and of the tractor are adjusted only by the amount of depreciation actually allowed under section 183 with respect to each (as determined by the above computation). The basis of the asset with regard to which the casualty loss was suffered is adjusted only to the extent of the amount of the casualty loss actually allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (1) (i) and (iii) of this paragraph.
(4)
Rule for capital gains and losses
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the gross income from any activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of all capital gains attributable to such activity determined without regard to the section 1202 deduction. Amounts attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit which would be allowable as a deduction under section 1202, without regard to section 183, shall be allowable as a deduction under section 183(b)(1) in accordance with the rules stated in this subparagraph.
(ii)
Cases where deduction not allowed under section 183.
No deduction is allowable under section 183(b)(1) with respect to capital gains attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit if:
(
a
) Without regard to section 183 and the regulations thereunder, there is no excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss for the year, or
(
b
) There is no excess of net long-term capital gain attributable to the activity over net short-term capital loss attributable to the activity.
(iii)
Allocation of deduction.
If there is:
(
a
) An excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit, and
(
b
) Such an excess attributable to all activities, determined without regard to section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the deduction allowable under section 183(b)(1) attributable to capital gains with respect to each activity not engaged in for profit (with respect to which there is an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss for the year) shall be an amount equal to the deduction allowable under section 1202 for the taxable year (determined without regard to section 183) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the excess of the net long-term capital gain attributable to the activity over
the net short-term capital loss attributable to the activity and the denominator of which is an amount equal to the total excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss for all activities with respect to which there is such excess. The amount of the total section 1202 deduction allowable for the year shall be reduced by the amount determined to be allocable to activities not engaged in for profit and accordingly allowed as a deduction under section 183(b)(1).
(iv)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, an individual who uses the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the calendar year as the taxable year, has three activities not engaged in for profit. For his taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, A has a $200 net long-term capital gain from activity No. 1, a $100 net short-term capital loss from activity No. 2, and a $300 net long-term capital gain from activity No. 3. In addition, A has a $500 net long-term capital gain from another activity which he engages in for profit. A computes his deductions for capital gains for calendar year 1973 as follows:
Section 1202 deduction without regard to section 183 is determined as follows:
Net long-term capital gain from activity No. 1
$200
Net long-term capital gain from activity No. 3
300
Net long-term capital gain from activity engaged in for profit
500
Total net long-term capital gain from all activities
1,000
Less: Net short-term capital loss attributable to activity No. 2
100
Aggregate net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss from all activities
900
Section 1202 deduction determined without regard to section 183 (one-half of $900)
$450
Allocation of the total section 1202 deduction among A's various activities:
Portion allocable to activity No. 1 which is deductible under section 183(b)(1) (Excess net long-term capital gain attributable to activity No. 1 ($200) over total excess net long-term capital gain attributable to all of A's activities with respect to which there is such an excess ($1,000) times amount of section 1202 deduction ($450))
90
Portion allocable to activity No. 3 which is deductible under section 183(b)(1) (Excess net long-term capital gain attributable to activity No. 3 ($300) over total excess net long-term capital gain attributable to all of A's activities with respect to which there is such an excess ($1,000) times amount of section 1202 deduction ($450))
135
Portion allocable to all activities engaged in for profit (total section 1202 deduction ($450) less section 1202 deduction allowable to activities Nos. 1 and 3 ($225))
225
Total section 1202 deduction deductible under sections 1202 and 183(b)(1)
450
(c)
Presumption that activity is engaged in for profit
—(1)
In general.
If for:
(i) Any 2 of 7 consecutive taxable years, in the case of an activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses, or
(ii) Any 2 of 5 consecutive taxable years, in the case of any other activity, the gross income derived from an activity exceeds the deductions attributable to such activity which would be allowed or allowable if the activity were engaged in for profit, such activity is presumed, unless the Commissioner establishes to the contrary, to be engaged in for profit. For purposes of this determination the deduction permitted by section 1202 shall not be taken into account. Such presumption applies with respect to the second profit year and all years subsequent to the second profit year within the 5- or 7-year period beginning with the first profit year. This presumption arises only if the activity is substantially the same activity for each of the relevant taxable years, including the taxable year in question. If the taxpayer does not meet the requirements of section 183(d) and this paragraph, no inference that the activity is not engaged in for profit shall arise by reason of the provisions of section 183. For purposes of this paragraph, a net operating loss deduction is not taken into account as a deduction. For purposes of this subparagraph a short taxable year constitutes a taxable year.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the taxpayer has not elected, in accordance with section 183(e), to postpone determination of whether the presumption described in section 183(d) and this paragraph is applicable.

# Example 1.
For taxable years 1970-74, A, an individual who uses the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the calendar year as the taxable year, is engaged
in the activity of farming. In taxable years 1971, 1973, and 1974, A's deductible expenditures with respect to such activity exceed his gross income from the activity. In taxable years 1970 and 1972 A has income from the sale of farm produce of $30,000 for each year. In each of such years A had expenses for feed for his livestock of $10,000, depreciation of equipment of $10,000, and fertilizer cost of $5,000 which he elects to take as a deduction. A also has a net operating loss carryover to taxable year 1970 of $6,000. A is presumed, for taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974, to have engaged in the activity of farming for profit, since for 2 years of a 5-consecutive-year period the gross income from the activity ($30,000 for each year) exceeded the deductions (computed without regard to the net operating loss) which are allowable in the case of the activity ($25,000 for each year).

# Example 2.
For the taxable years 1970 and 1971, B, an individual who uses the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the calendar year as taxable year, engaged in raising pure-bred Charolais cattle for breeding purposes. The operation showed a loss during 1970. At the end of 1971, B sold a substantial portion of his herd and the cattle operation showed a profit for that year. For all subsequent relevant taxable years B continued to keep a few Charolais bulls at stud. In 1972, B started to raise Tennessee Walking Horses for breeding and show purposes, utilizing substantially the same pasture land, barns, and (with structural modifications) the same stalls. The Walking Horse operations showed a small profit in 1973 and losses in 1972 and 1974 through 1976.
(i) Assuming that under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the raising of cattle and raising of horses are determined to be separate activities, no presumption that the Walking Horse operation was carried on for profit arises under section 183(d) and this paragraph since this activity was not the same activity that generated the profit in 1971 and there are not, therefore, 2 profit years attributable to the horse activity.
(ii) Assuming the same facts as in (i) above, if there were no stud fees received in 1972 with respect to Charolais bulls, but for 1973 stud fees with respect to such bulls exceed deductions attributable to maintenance of the bulls in that year, the presumption will arise under section 183(d) and this paragraph with respect to the activity of raising and maintaining Charolais cattle for 1973 and for all subsequent years within the 5-year period beginning with taxable year 1971, since the activity of raising and maintaining Charolais cattle is the same activity in 1971 and in 1973, although carried on by B on a much reduced basis and in a different manner. Since it has been assumed that the horse and cattle operations are separate activities, no presumption will arise with respect to the Walking Horse operation because there are not 2 profit years attributable to such horse operation during the period in question.
(iii) Assuming, alternatively, that the raising of cattle and raising of horses would be considered a single activity under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, B would receive the benefit of the presumption beginning in 1973 with respect to both the cattle and horses since there were profits in 1971 and 1973. The presumption would be effective through 1977 (and longer if there is an excess of income over deductions in this activity in 1974, 1975, 1976, or 1977 which would extend the presumption) if, under section 183(d) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, it was determined that the activity consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses. Otherwise, the presumption would be effective only through 1975 (assuming no excess of income over deductions in this activity in 1974 or 1975 which would extend the presumption).
(3)
Activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses.
For purposes of this paragraph an activity consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses for the taxable year if the average of the portion of expenditures attributable to breeding, training, showing, and racing of horses for the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year (or, in the case of an activity which has not been conducted by the taxpayer for 3 years, for so long as it has been carried on by him) was at least 50 percent of the total expenditures attributable to the activity for such prior taxable years.
(4)
Transitional rule.
In applying the presumption described in section 183(d) and this paragraph, only taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be taken into account. Accordingly, in the case of an activity referred to in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, section 183(d) does not apply prior to the second profitable taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, since taxable years prior to such date are not taken into account.
(5)
Cross reference.
For rules relating to section 183(e) which permits a taxpayer to elect to postpone determination of whether any activity shall be presumed to be “an activity engaged in for profit” by operation of the presumption described in section 183(d) and this paragraph until after the close
of the fourth taxable year (sixth taxable year, in the case of activity which consists in major part of breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses) following the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, see § 1.183-3.
(d)
Activity defined
—(1)
Ascertainment of activity.
In order to determine whether, and to what extent, section 183 and the regulations thereunder apply, the activity or activities of the taxpayer must be ascertained. For instance, where the taxpayer is engaged in several undertakings, each of these may be a separate activity, or several undertakings may constitute one activity. In ascertaining the activity or activities of the taxpayer, all the facts and circumstances of the case must be taken into account. Generally, the most significant facts and circumstances in making this determination are the degree of organizational and economic interrelationship of various undertakings, the business purpose which is (or might be) served by carrying on the various undertakings separately or together in a trade or business or in an investment setting, and the similarity of various undertakings. Generally, the Commissioner will accept the characterization by the taxpayer of several undertakings either as a single activity or as separate activities. The taxpayer's characterization will not be accepted, however, when it appears that his characterization is artificial and cannot be reasonably supported under the facts and circumstances of the case. If the taxpayer engages in two or more separate activities, deductions and income from each separate activity are not aggregated either in determining whether a particular activity is engaged in for profit or in applying section 183. Where land is purchased or held primarily with the intent to profit from increase in its value, and the taxpayer also engages in farming on such land, the farming and the holding of the land will ordinarily be considered a single activity only if the farming activity reduces the net cost of carrying the land for its appreciation in value. Thus, the farming and holding of the land will be considered a single activity only if the income derived from farming exceeds the deductions attributable to the farming activity which are not directly attributable to the holding of the land (that is, deductions other than those directly attributable to the holding of the land such as interest on a mortgage secured by the land, annual property taxes attributable to the land and improvements, and depreciation of improvements to the land).
(2)
Rules for allocation of expenses.
If the taxpayer is engaged in more than one activity, an item of deduction or income may be allocated between two or more of these activities. Where property is used in several activities, and one or more of such activities is determined not to be engaged in for profit, deductions relating to such property must be allocated between the various activities on a reasonable and consistently applied basis.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) A, an individual, owns a small house located near the beach in a resort community. Visitors come to the area for recreational purposes during only 3 months of the year. During the remaining 9 months of the year houses such as A's are not rented. Customarily, A arranges that the house will be leased for 2 months of 3-month recreational season to vacationers and reserves the house for his own vacation during the remaining month of the recreational season. In 1971, A leases the house for 2 months for $1,000 per month and actually uses the house for his own vacation during the other month of the recreational season. For 1971, the expenses attributable to the house are $1,200 interest, $600 real estate taxes, $600 maintenance, $300 utilities, and $1,200 which would have been allowed as depreciation had the activity been engaged in for profit. Under these facts and circumstances, A is engaged in a single activity, holding the beach house primarily for personal purposes, which is an “activity not engaged in for profit” within the meaning of section 183(c). See paragraph (b)(9) of § 1.183-2.
(ii) Since the $1,200 of interest and the $600 of real estate taxes are specifically allowable as deductions under sections 163 and 164(a) without regard to whether the beach house activity is engaged in for profit, no allocation of these expenses between the uses of the beach house is necessary. However, since section 262 specifically disallows personal, living, and family expenses as deductions, the maintenance and utilities expenses and the depreciation from the activity must be
allocated between the rental use and the personal use of the beach house. Under the particular facts and circumstances,
2/3
(2 months of rental use over 3 months of total use) of each of these expenses are allocated to the rental use, and
1/3
(1 month of personal use over 3 months of total use) of each of these expenses are allocated to the personal use as follows:
Rental use
2/3—
expenses allocable to section 183(b)(2)
Personal use
1/3—
expenses allocable to section 262
Maintenance expense $600
$400
$200
Utilities expense $300
200
100
Depreciation $1,200
800
400
Total
1,400
700
The $700 of expenses and depreciation allocated to the personal use of the beach house are disallowed as a deduction under section 262. In addition, the allowability of each of the expenses and the depreciation allocated to section 183(b)(2) is determined under paragraph (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. Thus, the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 183(b)(2) is $200 ($2,000 gross income from activity, less $1,800 deductions under section 183(b)(1)). Since the amounts described in section 183(b)(2) ($1,400) exceed the maximum amount allowable ($200), and since the amounts described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section ($600) exceed such maximum amount allowable ($200), none of the depreciation (an amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) is allowable as a deduction.
(e)
Gross income from activity not engaged in for profit defined.
For purposes of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, gross income derived from an activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of all gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, and all other gross receipts derived from such activity. Such gross income shall include, for instance, capital gains, and rents received for the use of property which is held in connection with the activity. The taxpayer may determine gross income from any activity by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the gross receipts so long as he consistently does so and follows generally accepted methods of accounting in determining such gross income.
(f)
Rule for electing small business corporations.
Section 183 and this section shall be applied at the corporate level in determining the allowable deductions of an electing small business corporation.

§ 1.183-2
Activity not engaged in for profit defined.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the term
activity not engaged in for profit
means any activity other than one with respect to which deductions are allowable for the taxable year under section 162 or under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 212. Deductions are allowable under section 162 for expenses of carrying on activities which constitute a trade or business of the taxpayer and under section 212 for expenses incurred in connection with activities engaged in for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income. Except as provided in section 183 and § 1.183-1, no deductions are allowable for expenses incurred in connection with activities which are not engaged in for profit. Thus, for example, deductions are not allowable under section 162 or 212 for activities which are carried on primarily as a sport, hobby, or for recreation. The determination whether an activity is engaged in for profit is to be made by reference to objective standards, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances of each case. Although a reasonable expectation of profit is not required, the facts and circumstances must indicate that the taxpayer entered into the activity, or continued the activity, with the objective of making a profit. In determining whether such an objective exists, it may be sufficient that there is a small chance of making a large profit. Thus it may be found that an investor in a wildcat oil well who incurs very substantial expenditures is in the venture for profit even though the expectation of a profit might be considered unreasonable. In determining whether an activity is engaged in for profit, greater weight is given to objective facts than to the taxpayer's mere statement of his intent.
(b)
Relevant factors.
In determining whether an activity is engaged in for profit, all facts and circumstances with
respect to the activity are to be taken into account. No one factor is determinative in making this determination. In addition, it is not intended that only the factors described in this paragraph are to be taken into account in making the determination, or that a determination is to be made on the basis that the number of factors (whether or not listed in this paragraph) indicating a lack of profit objective exceeds the number of factors indicating a profit objective, or vice versa. Among the factors which should normally be taken into account are the following:
(1)
Manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity.
The fact that the taxpayer carries on the activity in a businesslike manner and maintains complete and accurate books and records may indicate that the activity is engaged in for profit. Similarly, where an activity is carried on in a manner substantially similar to other activities of the same nature which are profitable, a profit motive may be indicated. A change of operating methods, adoption of new techniques or abandonment of unprofitable methods in a manner consistent with an intent to improve profitability may also indicate a profit motive.
(2)
The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors.
Preparation for the activity by extensive study of its accepted business, economic, and scientific practices, or consultation with those who are expert therein, may indicate that the taxpayer has a profit motive where the taxpayer carries on the activity in accordance with such practices. Where a taxpayer has such preparation or procures such expert advice, but does not carry on the activity in accordance with such practices, a lack of intent to derive profit may be indicated unless it appears that the taxpayer is attempting to develop new or superior techniques which may result in profits from the activity.
(3)
The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activity.
The fact that the taxpayer devotes much of his personal time and effort to carrying on an activity, particularly if the activity does not have substantial personal or recreational aspects, may indicate an intention to derive a profit. A taxpayer's withdrawal from another occupation to devote most of his energies to the activity may also be evidence that the activity is engaged in for profit. The fact that the taxpayer devotes a limited amount of time to an activity does not necessarily indicate a lack of profit motive where the taxpayer employs competent and qualified persons to carry on such activity.
(4)
Expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in value.
The term
profit
encompasses appreciation in the value of assets, such as land, used in the activity. Thus, the taxpayer may intend to derive a profit from the operation of the activity, and may also intend that, even if no profit from current operations is derived, an overall profit will result when appreciation in the value of land used in the activity is realized since income from the activity together with the appreciation of land will exceed expenses of operation. See, however, paragraph (d) of § 1.183-1 for definition of an activity in this connection.
(5)
The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities.
The fact that the taxpayer has engaged in similar activities in the past and converted them from unprofitable to profitable enterprises may indicate that he is engaged in the present activity for profit, even though the activity is presently unprofitable.
(6)
The taxpayer's history of income or losses with respect to the activity.
A series of losses during the initial or start-up stage of an activity may not necessarily be an indication that the activity is not engaged in for profit. However, where losses continue to be sustained beyond the period which customarily is necessary to bring the operation to profitable status such continued losses, if not explainable, as due to customary business risks or reverses, may be indicative that the activity is not being engaged in for profit. If losses are sustained because of unforeseen or fortuitous circumstances which are beyond the control of the taxpayer, such as drought, disease, fire, theft, weather damages, other involuntary conversions, or depressed market conditions, such losses would not be an indication that the activity is not engaged in for profit. A series of years in
which net income was realized would of course be strong evidence that the activity is engaged in for profit.
(7)
The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned.
The amount of profits in relation to the amount of losses incurred, and in relation to the amount of the taxpayer's investment and the value of the assets used in the activity, may provide useful criteria in determining the taxpayer's intent. An occasional small profit from an activity generating large losses, or from an activity in which the taxpayer has made a large investment, would not generally be determinative that the activity is engaged in for profit. However, substantial profit, though only occasional, would generally be indicative that an activity is engaged in for profit, where the investment or losses are comparatively small. Moreover, an opportunity to earn a substantial ultimate profit in a highly speculative venture is ordinarily sufficient to indicate that the activity is engaged in for profit even though losses or only occasional small profits are actually generated.
(8)
The financial status of the taxpayer.
The fact that the taxpayer does not have substantial income or capital from sources other than the activity may indicate that an activity is engaged in for profit. Substantial income from sources other than the activity (particularly if the losses from the activity generate substantial tax benefits) may indicate that the activity is not engaged in for profit especially if there are personal or recreational elements involved.
(9)
Elements of personal pleasure or recreation.
The presence of personal motives in carrying on of an activity may indicate that the activity is not engaged in for profit, especially where there are recreational or personal elements involved. On the other hand, a profit motivation may be indicated where an activity lacks any appeal other than profit. It is not, however, necessary that an activity be engaged in with the exclusive intention of deriving a profit or with the intention of maximizing profits. For example, the availability of other investments which would yield a higher return, or which would be more likely to be profitable, is not evidence that an activity is not engaged in for profit. An activity will not be treated as not engaged in for profit merely because the taxpayer has purposes or motivations other than solely to make a profit. Also, the fact that the taxpayer derives personal pleasure from engaging in the activity is not sufficient to cause the activity to be classified as not engaged in for profit if the activity is in fact engaged in for profit as evidenced by other factors whether or not listed in this paragraph.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer inherited a farm from her husband in an area which was becoming largely residential, and is now nearly all so. The farm had never made a profit before the taxpayer inherited it, and the farm has since had substantial losses in each year. The decedent from whom the taxpayer inherited the farm was a stockbroker, and he also left the taxpayer substantial stock holdings which yield large income from dividends. The taxpayer lives on an area of the farm which is set aside exclusively for living purposes. A farm manager is employed to operate the farm, but modern methods are not used in operating the farm. The taxpayer was born and raised on a farm, and expresses a strong preference for living on a farm. The taxpayer's activity of farming, based on all the facts and circumstances, could be found not to be engaged in for profit.

# Example 2.
The taxpayer is a wealthy individual who is greatly interested in philosophy. During the past 30 years he has written and published at his own expense several pamphlets, and he has engaged in extensive lecturing activity, advocating and disseminating his ideas. He has made a profit from these activities in only occasional years, and the profits in those years were small in relation to the amounts of the losses in all other years. The taxpayer has very sizable income from securities (dividends and capital gains) which constitutes the principal source of his livelihood. The activity of lecturing, publishing pamphlets, and disseminating his ideas is not an activity engaged in by the taxpayer for profit.

# Example 3.
The taxpayer, very successful in the business of retailing soft drinks, raises dogs and horses. He began raising a particular breed of dogs many years ago in the belief that the breed was in danger of declining, and he has raised and sold the dogs in each year since. The taxpayer recently began raising and racing thoroughbred horses. The losses from the taxpayer's dog and horse activities have increased in magnitude over
the years, and he has not made a profit on these operations during any of the last 15 years. The taxpayer generally sells the dogs only to friends, does not advertise the dogs for sale, and shows the dogs only infrequently. The taxpayer races his horses only at the “prestige” tracks at which he combines his racing activities with social and recreational activities. The horse and dog operations are conducted at a large residential property on which the taxpayer also lives, which includes substantial living quarters and attractive recreational facilities for the taxpayer and his family. Since (i) the activity of raising dogs and horses and racing the horses is of a sporting and recreational nature, (ii) the taxpayer has substantial income from his business activities of retailing soft drinks, (iii) the horse and dog operations are not conducted in a businesslike manner, and (iv) such operations have a continuous record of losses, it could be determined that the horse and dog activities of the taxpayer are not engaged in for profit.

# Example 4.
The taxpayer inherited a farm of 65 acres from his parents when they died 6 years ago. The taxpayer moved to the farm from his house in a small nearby town, and he operates it in the same manner as his parents operated the farm before they died. The taxpayer is employed as a skilled machine operator in a nearby factory, for which he is paid approximately $8,500 per year. The farm has not been profitable for the past 15 years because of rising costs of operating farms in general, and because of the decline in the price of the produce of this farm in particular. The taxpayer consults the local agent of the State agricultural service from time to time, and the suggestions of the agent have generally been followed. The manner in which the farm is operated by the taxpayer is substantially similar to the manner in which farms of similar size, and which grow similar crops in the area, are operated. Many of these other farms do not make profits. The taxpayer does much of the required labor around the farm himself, such as fixing fences, planting crops, etc. The activity of farming could be found, based on all the facts and circumstances, to be engaged in by the taxpayer for profit.

# Example 5.
A, an independent oil and gas operator, frequently engages in the activity of searching for oil on undeveloped and unexplored land which is not near proven fields. He does so in a manner substantially similar to that of others who engage in the same activity. The chances, based on the experience of A and others who engaged in this activity, are strong that A will not find a commercially profitable oil deposit when he drills on land not established geologically to be proven oil bearing land. However, on the rare occasions that these activities do result in discovering a well, the operator generally realizes a very large return from such activity. Thus, there is a small chance that A will make a large profit from his soil exploration activity. Under these circumstances, A is engaged in the activity of oil drilling for profit.

# Example 6.
C, a chemist, is employed by a large chemical company and is engaged in a wide variety of basic research projects for his employer. Although he does no work for his employer with respect to the development of new plastics, he has always been interested in such development and has outfitted a workshop in his home at his own expense which he uses to experiment in the field. He has patented several developments at his own expense but as yet has realized no income from his inventions or from such patents. C conducts his research on a regular, systematic basis, incurs fees to secure consultation on his projects from time to time, and makes extensive efforts to “market” his developments. C has devoted substantial time and expense in an effort to develop a plastic sufficiently hard, durable, and malleable that it could be used in lieu of sheet steel in many major applications, such as automobile bodies. Although there may be only a small chance that C will invent new plastics, the return from any such development would be so large that it induces C to incur the costs of his experimental work. C is sufficiently qualified by his background that there is some reasonable basis for his experimental activities. C's experimental work does not involve substantial personal or recreational aspects and is conducted in an effort to find practical applications for his work. Under these circumstances, C may be found to be engaged in the experimental activities for profit.

§ 1.183-4
Taxable years affected.
The provisions of section 183 and the regulations thereunder shall apply only with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For provisions applicable to prior taxable years, see section 270 and § 1.270-1.
[T.D. 7198, 37 FR 13685, July 13, 1972]
§ 1.186-1
Recoveries of damages for antitrust violations, etc.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
Under section 186, when a compensatory amount which is included in gross income is received or accrued during a taxable year for a compensable injury, a deduction is allowed in an amount equal to the
lesser of (1) such compensatory amount, or (2) the unrecovered losses sustained as a result of such compensable injury.
(b)
Compensable injury
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
compensable injury
means any of the injuries described in subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Patent infringement.
An injury sustained as a result of an infringement of a patent issued by the United States (whether or not issued to the taxpayer or another person or persons) constitutes a compensable injury. The term
patent issued by the United States
means any patent issued or granted by the United States under the authority of the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 153.
(3)
Breach of contract or of fiduciary duty or relationship.
An injury sustained as a result of a breach of contract (including an injury sustained by a third party beneficiary) or a breach of fiduciary duty or relationship constitutes a compensable injury.
(4)
Injury suffered under certain antitrust law violations.
An injury sustained in business, or to property, by reason of any conduct forbidden in the antitrust laws for which a civil action may be brought under section 4 of the Act of October 15, 1914 (15 U.S.C. 15), commonly known as the Clayton Act, constitutes a compensable injury.
(c)
Compensatory amount
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term,
compensatory amount
means any amount received or accrued during the taxable year as damages as a result of an award in, or in settlement of, a civil action for recovery for a compensable injury, reduced by any amounts paid or incurred in the taxable year in securing such award or settlement. The term
compensatory amount
includes only amounts compensating for actual economic injury. Thus, additional amounts representing punitive, exemplary, or treble damages are not included within the term. Where, for example, a taxpayer recovers treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, only one-third of the recovery representing economic injury constitutes a compensatory amount. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, amounts received in settlement of an action shall be deemed to be a recovery for an actual economic injury except to the extent such settlement amounts exceed actual damages claimed by the taxpayer in such action.
(2)
Interest on a compensatory amount.
Interest attributable to a compensatory amount shall not be included within the term
compensatory amount.
(3)
Settlement of a civil action for damages
—(i)
Necessity for an action.
The term
compensatory amount
does not include an amount received or accrued in settlement of a claim for a compensable injury if the amount is received or accrued prior to institution of an action. An action shall be considered as instituted upon completion of service of process, in accordance with the laws and rules of the court in which the action has been commenced or to which the action has been removed, upon all defendants who pay or incur an obligation to pay a compensatory amount.
(ii)
Specifications of the parties.
If an action for a compensable injury is settled, the specifications of the parties will generally determine compensatory amounts unless such specifications are not reasonably supported by the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, the parties may provide that the sum of $1,000 represents actual damages sustained as the result of antitrust violations and that the total amount of the settlement after the trebling of damages is $3,000. In such case, only the sum of $1,000 would be a compensatory amount. In the absence of specifications of the parties, the complaint filed by the taxpayer may be considered in determining what portion of the amount of the settlement is a compensatory amount.
(4)
Amounts paid or incurred in securing the award or settlement.
For purposes of this section, the term
amounts paid or incurred in the taxable year in securing such award or settlement
shall include legal expenses such as attorney's fees, witness fees, accountant fees, and court costs. Expenses incurred in securing a recovery of both a compensatory amount and other amounts from the same action shall be allocated among such amounts in the ratio each of such amounts bears to the total recovery. For instance, where a taxpayer
incurs attorney's fees and other expenses of $3,000 in recovering $10,000 as a compensatory amount, $5,000 as a return of capital, and $25,000 as punitive damages from the same action, the taxpayer shall allocate $750 of the expenses to the compensatory amount (10,000/40,000 × 3,000), $375 to the return of capital (5,000/40,000 × 3,000), and $1,875 to the punitive damages (25,000/40,000 × 3,000).
(d)
Unrecovered losses
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
unrecovered losses sustained as a result of such compensable injury
means the sum of the amounts of the net operating losses for each taxable year in whole or in part within the injury period, to the extent that such net operating losses are attributable to such compensable injury, reduced by (i) the sum of any amounts of such net operating losses which were allowed as a net operating loss carryback or carryover for any prior taxable year under the provisions of section 172, and (ii) the sum of any amounts allowed as deductions under section 186 (a) and this section for all prior taxable years with respect to the same compensable injury. Accordingly, a deduction is permitted under section 186(a) and this section with respect to net operating losses whether or not the period for carryover under section 172 has expired.
(2)
Injury period.
For purposes of this section, the term
injury period
means (i) with respect to an infringement of a patent, the period during which the infringement of the patent continued, (ii) with respect to a breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty or relationship, the period during which amounts would have been received or accrued but for such breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty or relationship, or (iii) with respect to injuries sustained by reason of a violation of section 4 of the Clayton Act, the period during which such injuries were sustained. The injury period will be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's situation. The injury period may include a periods before and after the period covered by the civil action instituted.
(3)
Net operating losses attributable to compensable injuries.
A net operating loss for any taxable year shall be treated as attributable (whether actually attributable or not) to a compensable injury to the extent the compensable injury is sustained during the taxable year. For purposes of determining the extent of the compensable injury sustained during a taxable year, a judgment for a compensable injury apportioning the amount of the recovery (not reduced by any amounts paid or incurred in securing such recovery) to specific taxable years within the injury period will be conclusive. If a judgment for a compensable injury does not apportion the amount of the recovery to specific taxable years within the injury period, the amount of the recovery will be prorated among the years within the injury period in the proportion that the net operating loss sustained in each of such years bear to the total net operating losses sustained for all such years. If an action is settled, the specifications of the parties will generally determine the apportionment of the amount of the recovery unless such specifications are not reasonably supported by the facts and circumstances of the case. In the absence of specifications of the parties, the amount of the recovery will be prorated among the years within the injury period in the proportion that the net operating loss sustained in each of such years bears to the total net operating losses sustained for all such years.
(4)
Application of losses attributable to a compensable injury.
If only a portion of a net operating loss for any taxable year is attributable to a compensable injury, such portion shall (in applying section 172 for purposes of this section) be considered to be a separate net operating loss for such year to be applied after the other portion of such net operating loss. If, for example, in the year of the compensable injury the net operating loss was $1,000 and the amount of the compensable injury was $600, the amount of $400 not attributable to the compensable injury would be used first to offset profits in the carryover or carryback periods as prescribed by section 172. After the amount not attributable to the compensable injury is used to offset profits in other years, then the amount attributable to the compensable injury will
be applied against profits in the carryover or carryback periods.
(e)
Effect on net operating loss carryovers
—(1)
In general.
Under section 186 (e) if for the taxable year in which a compensatory amount is received or accrued any portion of the net operating loss carryovers to such year is attributable to the compensable injury for which such amount is received or accrued, such portion of the net operating loss carryovers must be reduced by the excess, if any, of (i) the amount computed under section 186(e)(1) with respect to such compensatory amount, over (ii) the amount computed under section 186(e)(2) with respect to such compensable injury.
(2)
Amount computed under section 186(e)(1).
The amount computed under section 186(e)(1) is equal to the deduction allowed under section 186(a) with respect to the compensatory amount received or accrued for the taxable year.
(3)
Amount computed under section 186(e)(2).
The amount computed under section 186(e)(2) is equal to that portion of the unrecovered losses sustained as a result of the compensable injury with respect to which, as of the beginning of the taxable year, the period for carryover under section 172 has expired without benefit to the taxpayer, but only to the extent that such portion of the unrecovered losses did not reduce an amount computed under section 186(e)(1) for any prior taxable year.
(4)
Increase in income under section 172(b)(2).
If there is a reduction for any taxable year under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in the portion of the net operating loss carryovers to such year attributable to a compensable injury, then, solely for purposes of determining the amount of such portion which may be carried to subsequent taxable years, the income of such taxable year, as computed under section 172(b)(2), shall be increased by the amount of the reduction computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, for such year.
(f)
Illustration.
The provisions of section 186 and this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) As of the beginning of his taxable year 1969, taxpayer A has a net operating loss carryover from his taxable year 1966 of $550 of which $250 is attributable to a compensable injury. In addition, he has a net operating loss attributable to the compensable injury of $150 with respect to which the period for carryover under section 172 has expired without benefit to the taxpayer. In 1969, he receives a $100 compensatory amount with respect to that injury and he has $75 in other income. Thus, A has gross income of $175 and he is entitled to a $100 deduction (the compensatory amount received) under section 186(a) and this section since this amount is less than the unrecovered losses sustained as a result of the compensable injury ($250 + $150 = $400). No portion of the net operating loss carryover to the current taxable year attributable to the compensable injury is reduced under section 186(e) since the amount determined under section 186(e)(1) ($100) does not exceed the amount determined under section 186(e)(2) ($150). Therefore, A applies a net operating loss carryover of $550 against his remaining income of $75 and retains a net operating loss carryover of $475 to following years of which amount $250 remains attributable to the compensable injury. In addition, he retains $50 of net operating losses attributable to the compensable injury with respect to which the period for carryover under section 172 has expired without benefit to the taxpayer.
(ii) In 1970, A receives a $200 compensatory amount with respect to the same compensable injury and has $75 of other income. Thus, A has gross income of $275 and he is entitled to a $200 deduction (the compensatory amount received) under section 186(a) and this section since this amount is less than the remaining unrecovered loss sustained as a result of the compensable injury ($250 + $50 = $300). The net operating loss carryover to the current taxable year of $250 attributable to the compensable injury is reduced under section 186(e) by $150, which is the excess of the amount determined under section 186(e)(1) ($200) over the amount determined under section 186(e)(2) ($50). Therefore, A applies net operating loss carryovers of $325 ($225 not attributable to the compensable injury, + $100 attributable to such injury) against his remaining income of $75. A retains net operating loss carryovers of $250 for following years, of which amount $100 is attributable to the compensable injury. A has used all of his net operating losses attributable to the compensable injury with respect to which the period for carryover under section 172 has expired without benefit to the taxpayer.
(iii) In 1971, A receives a $200 compensatory amount with respect to the same compensable injury and has $75 of other income. Thus, A has gross income of $275 and he is entitled to a $100 deduction (the amount of unrecovered losses) under section 186(a) and this section since this amount is less than
the compensatory amount received ($200). The net operating loss carryover to the current taxable year of $100 attributable to the compensable injury is reduced under section 186(e) by $100, which is the excess of the amount determined under section 186(e)(1) ($100) over the amount determined under section 186(e)(2) ($0). Therefore, A applies net operating loss carryovers of $150 against his remaining income of $175 ($100 compensatory amount plus $75 other income) which leaves $25 taxable income. No net operating loss carryover remains for following years.
(g)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section are applicable as to compensatory amounts received or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1968, even though the compensable injury was sustained in taxable years beginning before such date.
[T.D. 7220, 37 FR 24744, Nov. 21, 1972]
§ 1.187-1
Amortization of certain coal mine safety equipment.
(a)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Under section 187(a), every person, at his election, shall be entitled to a deduction with respect to the amortization of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of any certified coal mine safety equipment (as defined in § 1.187-2), based on a period of 60 months. Such 60-month period shall, at the election of the taxpayer, begin either with the month following the month in which such equipment was placed in service or with the succeeding taxable year. For rules as to making or discontinuing the election, see paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For the computation of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of any certified coal mine safety equipment, see paragraph (b) of § 1.187-2.
(2)
Amount of deduction.
(i) Such amortization deduction shall be an amount, with respect to each month of such 60-month period which falls within the taxable year, equal to the adjusted basis for determining gain of the certified coal mine safety equipment at the end of such month divided by the number of months (including the month for which the deduction is computed) remaining in such 60-month period. Such adjusted basis at the end of any month shall be computed without regard to the amortization deduction for such month. The total amortization deduction with respect to any certified coal mine safety equipment for a particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such taxable year.
(ii) If any certified coal mine safety equipment is sold or exchanged or otherwise disposed of during a particular month, then the amortization deduction (if any) allowable to the transferor in respect of that month shall be that portion of the amount to which such person would be entitled for a full month which the number of days in such month during which the equipment was held by such person bears to the total number of days in such month.
(3)
Effect on other deductions.
(i) The amortization deduction provided by section 187(a) with respect to any month shall be in lieu of the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable with respect to such equipment under section 167 for such month.
(ii) If the adjusted basis of such coal mine safety equipment as computed under section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization deduction provided by section 187(a) is in excess of the adjusted basis, as computed under paragraph (b) of § 1.187-2, then such excess shall be recovered through depreciation deductions under the rules of section 167. See section 187(e), and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.187-2.
(iii) See section 179 and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of § 1.179-1 for additional first-year depreciation in respect of certified coal mine safety equipment.
(4)
Special rules.
(i) If the assets of a corporation which has elected to take the amortization deduction under section 187(a) are acquired by another corporation in a transaction to which section 381 (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the acquiring corporation is to be treated as if it were the transferor or distributor corporation for purposes of this section.
(ii) For the right of estates and trusts to take the amortization deduction provided by section 187 see section 642(f) and § 1.642(f)-1.
(iii) For the allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of coal
mine safety equipment of partnerships see section 703 and § 1.703-1.
(iv) In the case of certified coal mine safety equipment held by one person for life with the remainder to another person, the amortization deduction under section 187(a) shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the life tenant during his life.
(5)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1969.
(6)
Meaning of terms.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.187-2, all terms used in section 187 and the regulations thereunder shall have the meaning provided by this section and § 1.187-2.
(b)
Election of amortization
—(1)
In general.
Under section 187(b), an election by the taxpayer to make amortization deductions with respect to any certified coal mine safety equipment and to begin the 60-month amortization period shall be made by a statement to that effect attached to his return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. Such statement shall include the following information:
(i) A description clearly identifying each piece of certified coal mine safety equipment for which an amortization deduction is claimed;
(ii) The date on which such equipment was “placed in service” (see paragraph (a)(2)(i) of § 1.187-2);
(iii) The date on which the amortization period began;
(iv) The total costs paid or incurred in the acquisition and installation of such equipment;
(v) A computation showing the adjusted basis (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.187-2) of the equipment as of the beginning of the amortization period;
(vi) In the case of electric face equipment which is newly acquired by the taxpayer, a statement that the equipment has been certified by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines as being permissible within the meaning of section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969; and
(vii) In the case of property placed in service in connection with used electric face equipment (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.187-2), a statement that such property has resulted in the used electric face equipment becoming permissible and a copy of the notification that such property is permissible.
(2)
Late certification.
If, 90 days before the date on which the return described in this paragraph is due, a piece of coal mine safety equipment has not been certified as permissible by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines, then the election may be made by a statement in an amended income tax return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. The statement and amended return in such case must be filed not later than 90 days after the date the equipment is certified as permissible by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines. Amended income tax returns or claims for credit or refund should also be filed at this time for other taxable years which are within the amortization period and which are subsequent to the taxable year for which the election is made. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
(3)
Other requirements and considerations.
No method of making the election provided for in section 187(a) other than that prescribed in this section shall be permitted on or after August 11, 1971. A taxpayer who does not elect in the manner prescribed in this section to take amortization deductions with respect to certified coal mine safety equipment shall not be entitled to such deductions. In the case of a taxpayer who has elected prior to August 11, 1971 the statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be attached to his income tax return for his taxable year in which August 11, 1971 occurs.
(c)
Election to discontinue or revoke amortization
—(1)
Election to discontinue.
(i) Under section 187(c), if a taxpayer has elected to take the amortization deduction provided by section 187(a) with respect to any certified coal mine safety equipment, he may, after such election and prior to the expiration of the 60-month amortization period,
elect to discontinue the amortization deduction for the remainder of the 60-month period for such equipment.
(ii) An election to discontinue the amortization deduction shall be made by a statement in writing filed with the District Director or with the director of the Internal Revenue Service center with whom the return of the taxpayer is required to be filed for its taxable year in which falls the first month for which the election terminates. In addition, a copy of such statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return filed for such taxable year. Such statement shall specify the month as of the beginning of which the taxpayer elects to discontinue such deductions, and shall be filed before the beginning of the month specified therein. In addition, such notice shall contain a description clearly identifying the certified coal mine safety equipment with respect to which the taxpayer elects to discontinue the amortization deduction. If the taxpayer so elects to discontinue the amortization deduction, he shall not be entitled to any further amortization deductions under section 187 with respect to such equipment.
(2)
Revocation of elections made prior to August 11, 1971.
If before August 11, 1971 an election under section 187(a) has been made, consent is hereby given for the taxpayer to revoke such election without the consent of the Commissioner. Such election may be revoked by filing a notice of revocation on or before November 9, 1971. Such notice shall be in the form and shall be filed in the manner required by subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. If such revocation is for a period which falls within one or more taxable years for which an income tax return has been filed, an amended income tax return shall be filed for any taxable year in which a deduction was taken under section 187 on or before November 9, 1971.
(3)
Depreciation subsequent to discontinuance or in the case of revocation of amortization.
(i) A taxpayer who elects in the manner prescribed under subparagraph (1) of this section to discontinue amortization deductions under section 187(a) or under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to revoke an election made prior to August 11, 1971 with respect to an item of certified coal mine safety equipment may be entitled to a deduction for depreciation with respect to such equipment. See section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) In the case of an election to discontinue an amortization deduction under section 187, the deduction for depreciation shall be computed beginning with the first month as to which such amortization deduction is not applicable, and shall be based upon the adjusted basis (see section 1011 and the regulations thereunder) of the property as of the beginning of such month. Such depreciation deduction shall be based upon the remaining portion of the period authorized under section 167 for the facility, as determined as of the first day of the first month as of which the amortization deduction is not applicable.
(iii) In the case of a revocation of an election under section 187 referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the deduction for depreciation shall begin as of the time such depreciation deduction would have been taken but for the election under section 187. See subparagraph (2) of this section for rules as to filing amended returns for years for which amortization deductions have been taken.
(d)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On September 30, 1970, the X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, places in service a piece of coal mine safety equipment required as a result of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 which is certified as indicated in paragraph (a) of § 1.187-2. The cost of the equipment is $120,000. On its income tax return filed for 1970, the corporation elects to take the amortization deductions allowed by section 187(a) with respect to the equipment and to begin the 60-month amortization period with October 1970, the month following the month in which it was placed in service. The adjusted basis at the end of October 1970 (determined without regard to the amortization deduction allowed by section 187(a) for that month) is $120,000. The allowable amortization deduction with respect to such equipment for the taxable year 1970 is $6,000, computed as follows:
Monthly amortization deductions:
October: $120,000 divided by 60
$2,000
November: $118,000 ($120,000 minus $2,000) divided by 59
2,000
December: $116,000 ($118,000 minus $2,000) divided by 58
2,000
Total amortization deduction for 1970
6,000

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Assume further that on May 20, 1972, X properly files notice of its election to discontinue the amortization deductions with the month of June 1972. The adjusted basis of the equipment as of June 1, 1972 (assuming no capital additions or improvements) is $80,000, computed as follows: Yearly amortization deductions computed in accordance with
Example 1:
1970
$6,000
1971
24,000
1972 (for the first 5 months)
10,000
Total amortization deductions for 20 months
40,000
Adjusted basis at beginning of amortization period
120,000
Less: Amortization deductions
40,000
Adjusted basis as of June 1, 1972
80,000
Beginning as of June 1, 1972, the deduction for depreciation under section 167 is allowable with respect to the property on its adjusted basis of $80,000.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that on its income tax return filed in 1970, X does not elect to take amortization deductions allowed by section 187(a) but that on its income tax return filed for 1971 X elects to begin the amortization period as of January 1, 1971, the taxable year succeeding the taxable year the equipment was placed in service. Assume further that the only adjustment to basis for the period October 1, 1970, to January 1, 1971, is $3,000 for depreciation (the amount allowable, of which $2,000 is for additional first year depreciation under section 179) for the last 3 months of 1970. The adjusted basis (for determining gain) for purposes of section 187 as of that date is $120,000 less $3,000 or $117,000.

§ 1.187-2
Definitions.
(a)
Certified coal mine safety equipment
—(1)
In general
—(i) The term
certified coal mine safety equipment
means property which:
(
a
) Is electric face equipment (within the meaning of section 305 of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969) required in order to meet the requirements of section 305(a)(2) of such Act,
(
b
) The Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines certifies is permissible within the meaning of such section 305(a)(2), and
(
c
) Is placed in service (as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) before January 1, 1975.
(ii) In addition, property placed in service in connection with any used electric face equipment which the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines certifies makes such used electric face equipment permissible shall be treated as a separate item of certified coal mine safety equipment. See subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph.
(2)
Meaning of terms.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(c) of this paragraph, the term
placed in service
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in paragraph (d) of § 1.46-3.
(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the term
property
includes those costs of converting existing nonpermissible electric face equipment to a permissible condition which are chargeable to capital account under the principles of § 1.1016-2. Property is considered to be placed in service in connection with used electric face equipment (which was not permissible) if its use causes such electric face equipment to be certified as permissible.
(b)
Adjusted basis
—(1)
In general.
The basis upon which the deduction with respect to amortization allowed by section 187 is to be computed with respect to any item of certified coal mine safety equipment shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for the purpose of determining gain on the sale or other disposition of such property (see part II (section 1011 and following) subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code) computed as of the first day of the amortization period. For an example showing the determination of the adjusted basis referred to in the preceding sentence in the case where the amortization period begins with the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which the property is placed in service see
Example 3
in paragraph (d) of § 1.187-1.
(2)
Capital additions.
The adjusted basis of any certified coal mine safety equipment, with respect to which an election is made under section 187(b), shall not be increased, for purposes of section 187, for amounts chargeable to
the capital account for additions or improvements after the amortization period has begun. However, nothing contained in this section or § 1.187-1 shall be deemed to disallow a deduction for depreciation for such capital additions. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer places a piece of certified coal mine safety equipment in service in 1971 and in 1972 makes improvements to it the expenditures for which are chargeable to the capital account, such improvements shall not increase the adjusted basis of the equipment for purposes of computing the amortization deduction allowed by section 187(a). However, the depreciation deduction provided by section 167 shall be allowed with respect to such improvements in accordance with the principles of section 167.
[T.D. 7137, 36 FR 14734, Aug. 11, 1971; 36 FR 19251, Oct. 1, 1971]
§ 1.188-1
Amortization of certain expenditures for qualified on-the-job training and child care facilities.
(a)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Under section 188, at the election of the taxpayer, any eligible expenditure (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) made by such taxpayer to acquire, construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) shall be allowable as a deduction ratably over a period of 60 months. Such 60-month period shall begin with the month in which such property is placed in service. For rules for making the election, see paragraph (b) of this section. For rules relating to the termination of an election, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Amount of deduction
—(i)
In general.
For each eligible expenditure attributable to an item of section 188 property the amortization deduction shall be an amount, with respect to each month of the 60-month amortization period which falls within the taxable year, equal to the elgible expenditure divided by 60. The total amortization deduction with respect to each item of section 188 property for a particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such taxable year. The total amortization deduction under section 188 for a particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions allowable with respect to each item of section 188 property for that taxable year.
(ii)
Separate amortization period for each expenditure.
Each eligible expenditure attributable to an item of section 188 property to which an election relates shall be amortized over a 60-month period beginning with the month in which the item of section 188 property is placed in service. Thus, if a taxpayer makes an eligible expenditure for an addition to, or improvement of, section 188 property, such expenditure must be amortized over a separate 60-month period beginning with the month in which the section 188 property is placed in service.
(iii)
Separate items.
The determination of what constitutes a separate item of section 188 property is to be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Additions or improvements to an existing item of section 188 property are treated as a separate item of section 188 property. In general, each item of personal property is a separate item of property and each building, or separate element or structural component thereof, is a separate item of property. For purposes of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, two or more items of property may be treated as a single item of property if such items (A) are placed in service within the same month of the taxable year, (B) have same estimated useful life, and (C) are to be used in a functionally related manner in the operation of a qualified on-the-job training or child care facility or are integrally related facilities (described in paragraph (d) (3) or (4) of this section.
(iv)
Disposition of property or termination of election.
If an item of section 188 property is sold or exchanged or otherwise disposed of (or if the item of property ceases to be used as section 188 property by the taxpayer) during a particular month, then the amortization deduction (if any) allowable to the taxpayer in respect of that item for that month shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount to which the taxpayer would be entitled for a full month as the number of days
in such month during which the property was held by him (or used by him as section 188 property) bears to the total number of days in such month.
(3)
Effect on other deductions.
The amortization deduction provided by section 188(a) with respect to any month shall be in lieu of any depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under sections 167 or 179 with respect to that portion of the adjusted basis of the property attributable to an adjustment under section 1016(a)(1) made on account of an eligible expenditure.
(4)
Depreciation with respect to property ceasing to be used as section 188 property.
A taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for the depreciation (to the extent allowable under section 167) of property with respect to which the election under section 188 is terminated under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. The deduction for depreciation shall begin with the date of such termination and shall be computed on the adjusted basis of the property as of such date. The depreciation deduction shall be based upon the estimated remaining useful life and salvage value authorized under section 167 for the property as of the termination date.
(5)
Investment credit not to be allowed.
Any property with respect to which an election has been made under section 188(a) shall not be treated as section 38 property within the meaning of section 48(a).
(6)
Special rules
—(i)
Life estates.
In the case of section 188 property held by one person for life with the remainder to another person, the amortization deduction under section 188(a) shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the life tenant during his life.
(ii)
Certain corporate acquistions.
If the assets of a corporation which has elected to take the amortization deduction under section 188(a) are acquired by another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the acquiring corporation is to be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of this section.
(iii)
Estates and trusts.
For the allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of estates and trusts, see section 642(f) and § 1.642(f)-(1).
(iv)
Partnerships.
For the allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of partnerships, see section 703 and § 1.703-1.
(b)
Time and manner of making election
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an election to amortize an eligible expenditure under section 188 shall be made by attaching, to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable period for which the deduction is first allowable to such taxpayer, a written statement containing:
(i) A description clearly identifying each item of property (or two or more items of property treated as a single item) forming a part of a qualified on-the-job training or child care facility to which the election relates. e.g., building, classroom equipment, etc.;
(ii) The date on which the eligible expenditure was made for such item of property (or the period during which eligible expenditures were made for two or more items of property treated as a single item of property);
(iii) The date on which such item of property was “placed in service” (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section);
(iv) The amount of the eligible expenditure of such item of property (or the total amount of expenditures for two or more items of property treated as a single item); and
(v) The annual amortization deduction claimed with respect to such item of property.
If the taxpayer does not file a timely return (taking into account extensions of the time for filing) for the taxable year for which the election is first to be made, the election shall be filed at the time the taxpayer files his first return for that year. The election may be made with an amended return only if such amended return is filed no later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year of election.
(2)
Special rule.
With respect to any return filed before (90 days after the
date on which final regulations are filed with the Office of the Federal Register), the election to amortize an eligible expenditure for section 188 property shall be made by a statement on, or attached to, the income tax return (or an amended return) for the taxable year, indicating that an election is being made under section 188 and setting forth information to identify the election and the facility or facilities to which it applies. An election made under the provisions of this subparagraph, must be made not later than (i) the time, including extensions thereof, prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election is being made or (ii) before (90 days after the date on which final regulations under section 188 are filed with the Office of the Federal Register), whichever is later. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
(3)
No other method of making election.
No method for making the election under section 188(a) other than the method prescribed in this paragraph shall be permitted. If an election to amortize section 188 property is not made within the time and in the manner prescribed in this paragraph, no election may be made (by the filing of an amended return or in any other manner) with respect to such section 188 property.
(4)
Effect of election.
An election once made may not be revoked by a taxpayer with respect to any item of section 188 property to which the election relates. The election of the amortization deducted for an item of section 188 property shall not affect the taxpayer's right to elect or not to elect the amortization deduction as to other items of section 188 property even though the items are part of the same facility. For rules relating to the termination of an election other than by revocation by the taxpayer, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Termination of election.
If the specific use of an item of section 188 property in connection with a qualified on-the-job training or child care facility is discontinued, the election made with respect to that item of property shall be terminated. The termination shall be effective with respect to such item of property as of the earliest date on which the taxpayer's specific use of the item is no longer in connection with the operation of a qualified on-the-job training or child care facility. If a facility ceases to meet the applicable requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, relating to qualified on-the-job training facilities, or paragraph (d)(4) of this section, relating to qualified child care facilities, the election or elections made with respect to the items of section 188 property comprising such facility shall be terminated. The termination shall be effective with respect to such items of poperty as of the earliest date on which the facility is no longer qualified under the applicable rules. For rules relating to depreciation with respect to property ceasing to be used as section 188 property, see paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(d)
Definitions and special requirements
—(1)
Eligible expenditure.
For purposes of this section, the term
eligible expenditure
means an expenditure:
(i) Chargeable to capital account;
(ii) Made after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1982, to acquire, construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property which is a qualified child care center facility (or, made after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1977, to acquire, construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property which is a qualified on-the-job training facility); and
(iii) For which, but only to the extent that, a grant or other reimbursement excludable from gross income is not, directly or indirectly, payable to, or for the benefit of, the taxpayer with respect to such expenditure under any job training or child care program established or funded by the United States, a State, or any instrumentality of the foregoing, or the District of Columbia.
For purposes of this subparagraph, an expenditure is considered to be made when actually paid by a taxpayer who computes his taxable income under the cash receipts and disbursements method or when the obligation therefore is incurred by a taxpayer who computes
his taxable income under the accrual method. See subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for the determination of when section 188 property is placed in service for purposes of beginning the 60-month amortization period.
(2)
Section 188 property.
Section 188 property is tangible property which is:
(i) Of a character subject to depreciation;
(ii) Located within the United States; and
(iii) Specifically used as an integral part of a qualified on-the-job training facility (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) or as an integral part of a qualified child care center facility (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.)
(3)
Qualified on-the-job training facility.
A
qualified on-the-job training facility
is a facility specifically used by an employer as an on-the-job training facility in connection with an occupational training program for his employees or prospective employees provided that with respect to such program:
(i) All of the following requirements are met:
(A) There is offered at the training facility a systematic program comprised of work and training and related instruction;
(B) The occupation, together with a listing of its basic skills, and the estimated schedule of time for accomplishments of such skills, are clearly identified;
(C) The content of the training is adequate to qualify the employee, or prospective employee, for the occupation for which the individual is being trained;
(D) The skills are to be imparted by competent instructors;
(E) Upon completion of the training, placement is to be based primarily upon the skills learned through the training program;
(F) The period of training is not less than the time necessary to acquire minimum job skills nor longer than the usual period of training for the same occupation; and
(G) There is reasonable certainty that employment will be available with the employer in the occupation for which the training is provided; or
(ii) The employer has entered into an agreement with the United States, or a State agency, under the provisions of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, as amended and supplemented (42 U.S.C. 2571
et seq.
), the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended and supplemented (42 U.S.C. 2701
et seq.
), section 432(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended and supplemented (42 U.S.C. 632(b)(1)), the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937, as amended and supplemented (29 U.S.C. 50
et seq.
), or other similar Federal statute.
A
facility
consists of a building or any portion of a building and its structural components in which training is conducted, and equipment or other personal property necessary to teach a trainee the basic skills required for satisfactory performance in the occupation for which the training is being given. A facility also includes a building or portion of a building which provides essential services for trainees during the course of the training program, such as a dormitory or dining hall. For purposes of this section, a facility is considered to be specifically used as an on-the-job training facility if such facility is actually used for such purposes and is not used in a significant manner for any purpose other than job training or the furnishing of essential services for trainees such as meals and lodging. For purposes of the preceding sentence if a facility is used 20 percent of the time for a purpose other than on-the-job training or providing trainees with essential services, it would not satisfy the significant use test. Thus, a production facility is not an on-the-job training facility for purposes of section 188 simply because new employees receive training on the machines they will be using as fully productive employees. A facility is considered to be used by an employer in connection with an occupational training program for his employees or prospective employees if at least 80 percent of the trainees participating in the program are employees or prospective employees. For purposes of this section, a prospective employee is a trainee with
respect to whom it is reasonably expected that the trainee will be employed by the employer upon successful completion of the training program.
(4)
Qualified child care facility.
A
qualified child care facility
is a facility which is:
(i) Particulary suited to provide child care services and specifically used by an employer to provide such services primarily for his employees' children;
(ii) Operated as a licensed or approved facility under applicable local law, if any, relating to the day care of children; and
(iii) If directly or indirectly funded to any extent by the United States, established and operated in compliance with the requirements contained in Part 71 of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, relating to Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements. For purposes of this subparagraph, a
facility
consists of the buildings, or portions or structural components thereof, in which children receive such personal care protection, and supervision in the absence of their parents as may be required to meet their needs, and the equipment or other personal property necessary to render such services. Whether or not a facility, or any component property thereof, is particularly suited for the needs of the children being cared for depends upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Generally, a building and its structural component, or a room therein, and equipment are particulary suitable for furnishing child care service if they are designed or adapted for such use or satisfy requirements under local law for such use as a condition to granting a license for the operation of the facility. For example, such property includes special kitchen or toilet facilities connected to the building or room in which the services are rendered and equipment such as children's desks, chairs, and play or instructional equipment. Such property would not include general purpose rooms used for many purposes (for example, a room used as an employee recreation center during the evening) nor would it include a room or a part of a room which is simply screened off for use by children during the day. For purposes of this section, a facility is considered to be specifically used as a child care facility if such facility is actually used for such purpose and is not used in a significant manner for any purpose other than child care. For purposes of this subparagraph, a child care facility is used by an employer to provide child care services primarily for children of employees of the employer if, for any month, no more than 20 percent of the average daily enrolled or attending children for such month are other than children of such employees.
(5)
Placed in service.
For purposes of section 188 and this section, the term
placed in service
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in paragraph (d) of § 1.46-3.
(6)
Employees.
For purposes of section 188 and this section, the terms
employees
and
prospective employees
include employees and prospective employees of a member of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563) of which the taxpayer is a member.
(e)
Effective date.
The provisions of section 188 and this section apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1971.
[T.D. 7599, 44 FR 14549, Mar. 13, 1979]
§ 1.190-1
Expenditures to remove architectural and transportation barriers to the handicapped and elderly.
(a)
In general.
Under section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a taxpayer may elect, in the manner provided in § 1.190-3 of this chapter, to deduct certain amounts paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 1980, for qualified architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses (as defined in § 1.190-2(b) of this chapter). In the case of a partnership, the election shall be made by the partnership. The election applies to expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year which (but for the election) are chargeable to capital account.
(b)
Limitation.
The maximum deduction for a taxpayer (including an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return) for any taxable year is $25,000. The $25,000 limitation applies to a partnership and to each partner.
Expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible under section 190 for such taxable year are capital expenditures and are adjustments to basis under section 1016(a). A partner must combine his distributive share of the partnership's deductible expenditures (after application of the $25,000 limitation at the partnership level) with that partner's distributive share of deductible expenditures from any other partnership plus that partner's own section 190 expenditures, if any (if he makes the election with respect to his own expenditures), and apply the partner's $25,000 limitation to the combined total to determine the aggregate amount deductible by that partner. In so doing, the partner may allocate the partner's $25,000 limitation among the partner's own section 190 expenditures and the partner's distributive share of partnership deductible expenditures in any manner. If such allocation results in all or a portion of the partner's distributive share of a partnership's deductible expenditures not being an allowable deduction by the partner, the partnership may capitalize such unallowable portion by an appropriate adjustment to the basis of the relevant partnership property under section 1016. For purposes of adjustments to the basis of properties held by a partnership, however, it shall be presumed that each partner's distributive share of partnership deductible expenditures (after application of the $25,000 limitation at the partnership level) was allowable in full to the partner. This presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that all or any portion of a partner's distributive share of the partnership section 190 deduction was not allowable as a deduction to the partner because it exceeded that partner's $25,000 limitation as allocated by him. For example, suppose for 1978 A's distributive share of the ABC partnership's deductible section 190 expenditures (after application of the $25,000 limitation at the partnership level) is $15,000. A also made section 190 expenditures of $20,000 in 1978 which he elects to deduct. A allocates $10,000 of his $25,000 limitation to his distributive share of the ABC expenditures and $15,000 to his own expenditures. A may capitalize the excess $5,000 of his own expenditures. In addition, if ABC obtains from A evidence which meets the requisite burden of proof, it may capitalize the $5,000 of A's distributive share which is not allowable as a deduction to A.

§ 1.190-3
Election to deduct architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses.
(a)
Manner of making election.
The election to deduct expenditures for removal of architectural and transportation barriers provided by section 190(a) shall be made by claiming the deduction as a separate item identified as such on the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which such election is to apply (or, in the case of a partnership, to the return of partnership income for such year). For the election to be valid, the return must be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year for which the election is to apply.
(b)
Scope of election.
An election under section 190(a) shall apply to all expenditures described in § 1.190-2 (or in the case of a taxpayer whose architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses exceed $25,000 for the taxable year, to the $25,000 of such expenses with respect to which the deduction is claimed) paid or incurred during the taxable year for which made and shall be irrevocable after the date by which any such election must have been made.
(c)
Records to be kept.
In any case in which an election is made under section 190(a), the taxpayer shall have available, for the period prescribed by paragraph (e) of § 1.6001-1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), records and documentation, including architectural plans and blueprints, contracts, and any building permits, of all the facts necessary to determine the amount of any deduction to which he is entitled by reason of the election, as well as the amount of any adjustment to basis made for expenditures in excess of the amount deductible under section 190.
[T.D. 7634, 44 FR 13273, July 24, 1979]
§ 1.193-1
Deduction for tertiary injectant expenses.
(a)
In general.
Subject to the limitations and restrictions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, there shall be allowed as a deduction from gross income an amount equal to the qualified tertiary injectant expenses of the taxpayer. This deduction is allowed for the later of:
(1) The taxable year in which the injectant is injected, or
(2) The taxable year in which the expenses are paid or incurred.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Qualified tertiary injectant expenses.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the term
qualified tertiary injectant expense
means any cost paid or incurred for any tertiary injectant which is used as part of a tertiary recovery method.
(2)
Tertiary recovery method. Tertiary recovery method
means:
(i) Any method which is described in subparagraphs (1) through (9) of section 212.78(c) of the June 1979 energy regulations (as defined by section 4996(b)(8)(C)),
(ii) Any method for which the taxpayer has obtained the approval of the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), under section 4993(d)(1)(B) for purposes of Chapter 45 of the Internal Revenue Code,
(iii) Any method which is approved in the regulations under section 4993(d)(1)(B), or
(iv) Any other method to provide tertiary enhanced recovery for which the taxpayer obtains the approval of the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical) for purposes of section 193.
(c)
Special rules for hydrocarbons
—(1)
In general.
If an injectant contains more than an insignificant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons, the amount deductible under section 193 and paragraph (a) of this section shall be limited to the cost of the injectant reduced by the lesser of:
(i) The fair market value of the hydrocarbon component in the form in which it is recovered, or
(ii) The cost to the taxpayer of the hydrocarbon component of the injectant. Price levels at the time of injection are to be used in determining the fair market value of the recoverable hydrocarbons.
(2)
Presumption of recoverability.
Except to the extent that the taxpayer can demonstrate otherwise, all hydrocarbons shall be presumed recoverable and shall be presumed to have the same value on recovery that they would have if separated from the other components of the injectant before injection. Estimates based on generally accepted engineering practices may provide evidence of limitations on the amount or value of recoverable hydrocarbons.
(3)
Significant amount.
For purposes of section 193 and this section, an injectant contains more than an insignificant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons if the fair market value of the recoverable hydrocarbon component of the injectant, in the form in which it is recovered, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the cost of the injectant.
(4)
Hydrocarbon defined.
For purposes of section 193 and this section, the term
hydrocarbon
means all forms of natural gas and crude oil (which includes oil recovered from sources such as oil shale and condensate).
(5)
Injectant defined.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (c), an injectant is the substance or mixture of substances injected at a particular time. Substances injected at different times are not treated as components of a single injectant even if the injections are part of a single tertiary recovery process.
(d)
Application with other deductions.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 193 and this section for any expenditure:
(1) With respect to which the taxpayer has made an election under section 263(c) or
(2) With respect to which a deduction is allowed or allowable under any other provision of chapter 1 of the Code.
(e)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, a calendar year taxpayer why uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, uses an approved tertiary recovery method for the enhanced recovery of crude oil from one of B's oil properties. During 1980, B pays $100x for a tertiary injectant which contains 1,000y units of hydrocarbon; if separated from the other components of the injectant before injection, the hydrocarbons would have a fair market value of $80x. B uses this injectant during the recovery effort during 1981. B has not made any election under section 263(c) with respect to the expenditures for the injectant, and no section of chapter 1 of the Code other than section 193 allows a deduction for the expenditure. B is unable to demonstrate that the value of the injected hydrocarbons recovered during production will be less than $80x. B's deduction under section 193 is limited to the excess of the cost for the injectant over the fair market value of the hydrocarbon component expected to be recovered ($100x−$80x = $20x). B may claim the deduction only for 1981, the year of the injection.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that through engineering studies B has shown that 700y units or 70 percent of the hydrocarbon injected is nonrecoverable. The recoverable hydrocarbons have a fair market value of $24x (30 percent of $80x). The recoverable hydrocarbon portion of the injectant is 24 percent of the cost of the injectant ($24x divided by $100x). The injectant does not contain a significant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons. B may claim a deduction for $100x, the entire cost of the injectant.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that through laboratory studies B has shown that because of chemical changes in the course of production the injected hydrocarbons that are recovered will have a fair market value of only $40x. B may claim a deduction for $60x, the excess of the cost of the injectant ($100x) over the fair market value of the recoverable hydrocarbons ($40x).

# Example 4.
B prepares an injectant from crude oil and certain non-hydrocarbon materials purchased by B. The total cost of the
injectant to B is $100x, of which $24x is attributable to the crude oil. The fair market value of the crude oil used in the injectant is $27x. B is unable to demonstrate that the value of the crude oil from the injectant that will be recovered is less than $27x. The injectant contains more than an insignificant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons because the value of the recoverable crude oil ($27x) exceeds $25x (25 percent of $100x, the cost of the injectant). Because the cost to B of the hydrocarbon component of the injectant ($24x) is less than the fair market value of the hydrocarbon component in the form in which it is recovered ($27x), the cost rather than the value is taken into account in the adjustment required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. B's deduction under section 193 is limited to the excess of the cost of the injectant over the cost of the hydrocarbon component ($100x−$24x = $76x).
(Secs. 193 and 7805, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 94 Stat. 286, 26 U.S.C. 193; 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805)
[T.D. 7980, 49 FR 39052, Oct. 3, 1984]
§ 1.194-1
Amortization of reforestation expenditures.
(a)
In general.
Section 194 allows a taxpayer to elect to amortize over an 84-month period, up to $10,000 of reforestation expenditures (as defined in § 1.194-3(c)) incurred by the taxpayer in a taxable year in connection with qualified timber property (as defined in § 1.194-3(a)). The election is not available to trusts. Only those reforestation expenditures which result in additions to capital accounts after December 31, 1979 are eligible for this special amortization.
(b)
Determination of amortization period.
The amortization period must begin on the first day of the first month of the last half of the taxable year during which the taxpayer incurs the reforestation expenditures. For example, the 84-month amortization period begins on July 1 of a taxable year for a calendar year taxpayer, regardless of whether the reforestation expenditures are incurred in January or December of that taxable year. Therefore, a taxpayer will be allowed to claim amortization deductions for only six months of each of the first and eighth taxable years of the period over which the reforestation expenditures will be amortized.
(c)
Recapture.
If a taxpayer disposes of qualified timber property within ten years of the year in which the amortizable basis was created and the taxpayer has claimed amortization deductions under section 194, part or all of any gain on the disposition may be recaptured as ordinary income. See section 1245.
[T.D. 7927, 48 FR 55849, Dec. 16, 1983]
§ 1.194-2
Amount of deduction allowable.
(a)
General rule.
The allowable monthly deduction with respect to reforestation expenditures made in a taxable year is determined by dividing the amount of reforestation expenditures made in such taxable year (after applying the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section) by 84. In order to determine the total allowable amortization deduction for a given month, a taxpayer should add the monthly amortization deductions computed under the preceding sentence for qualifying expenditures made by the taxpayer in the taxable year and the preceding seven taxable years.
(b)
Dollar limitation
—(1)
Maximum amount subject to election.
A taxpayer may elect to amortize up to $10,000 of qualifying reforestation expenditures each year under section 194. However, the maximum amortizable amount is $5,000 in the case of a married individual (as defined in section 143) filing a separate return. No carryover or carryback of expenditures in excess of $10,000 is permitted. The maximum annual amortization deduction for expenditures incurred in any taxable year is $1,428.57 ($10,000/7). The maximum deduction in the first and eighth taxable years of the amortization period is one-half that amount, or $714.29, because of the half-year convention provided in § 1.194-1(b). Total deductions for any one year under this section will reach $10,000 only if a taxpayer incurs and elects to amortize the maximum $10,000 of expenditures each year over an 8-year period.
(2)
Allocation of amortizable basis among taxpayer's timber properties.
The limit of $10,000 on amortizable reforestation expenditures applies to expenditures paid or incurred during a taxable year on all of the taxpayer's timber properties. A taxpayer who incurs more than $10,000 in qualifying expenditures
in connection with more than one qualified timber property during a taxable year may select the properties for which section 194 amortization will be elected as well as the manner in which the $10,000 limitation on amortizable basis is allocated among such properties. For example, A incurred $10,000 of qualifying reforestation expenditures on each of four properties in 1981. A may elect under section 194 to amortize $2,500 of the amount spent on each property, $5,000 of the amount spent on any two properties, the entire $10,000 spent on any one property, or A may allocate the $10,000 maximum amortizable basis among some or all of the properties in any other manner.

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the basis of a taxpayer's interest in qualified timber property for which an election is made under section 194 shall be adjusted to reflect the amount of the section 194 amortization deduction allowable to the taxpayer.
(ii)
Special rule for trusts.
Although a trust may be a partner of a partnership, income beneficiary of an estate, or (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982) shareholder of an S corporation, it may not deduct its allocable share of a section 194 amortization deduction allowable to such a partnership, estate, or S corporation. In addition, the basis of the interest held by the partnership, estate, or S corporation in the qualified timber property shall not be adjusted to reflect the portion of the section 194 amortization deduction that is allocable to the trust.
(4)
Allocation of amortizable basis among component members of a controlled group.
Component members of a controlled group (as defined in § 1.194-3(d)) on a December 31 shall be treated as one taxpayer in applying the $10,000 limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The amortizable basis may be allocated to any one such member or allocated (for the taxable year of each such member which includes such December 31) among the several members in any manner,
Provided
That the amount of amortizable basis allocated to any member does not exceed the amount of amortizable basis actually acquired by the member in the taxable year. The allocation is to be made (i) by the common parent corporation if a consolidated return is filed for all component members of the group, or (ii) in accordance with an agreement entered into by the members of the group if separate returns are filed. If a consolidated return is filed by some component members of the group and separate returns are filed by other component members, then the common parent of the group filing the consolidated return shall enter into an agreement with those members who do not join in filing the consolidated return allocating the amount between the group filing the return and the other component members of the controlled group who do not join in filing the consolidated return. If a consolidated return is filed, the common parent corporation shall file a separate statement attached to the income tax return on which an election is made to amortize reforestation costs under section 194. See § 1.194-4. If separate returns are filed by some or all component members of the group, each component member to which is allocated any part of the deduction under section 194 shall file a separate statement attached to the income tax return in which an election is made to amortize reforestation expenditures. See § 1.194-4. Such statement shall include the name, address, employer identification number, and the taxable year of each component member of the controlled group, a copy of the allocation agreement signed by persons duly authorized to act on behalf of those members who file separate returns, and a description of the manner in which the deduction under section 194 has been divided among them.
(5)
Partnerships
—(i)
Election to be made by partnership.
A partnership makes the election to amortize qualified reforestation expenditures of the partnership. See section 703(b).
(ii)
Dollar limitations applicable to partnerships.
The dollar limitations of section 194 apply to the partnership as well as to each partner. Thus, a partnership may not elect to amortize more than $10,000 of reforestation expenditures under section 194 in any taxable year.
(iii)
Partner's share of amortizable basis.
Section 704 and the regulations thereunder shall govern the determination of a partner's share of a partnership's amortizable reforestation expenditures for any taxable year.
(iv)
Dollar limitation applicable to partners.
A partner shall in no event be entitled in any taxable year to claim a deduction for amortization based on more than $10,000 ($5,000 in the case of a married taxpayer who files a separate return) of amortizable basis acquired in such taxable year regardless of the source of the amortizable basis. In the case of a partner who is a member of two or more partnerships that elect under section 194, the partner's aggregate share of partnership amortizable basis may not exceed $10,000 or $5,000, whichever is applicable. In the case of a member of a partnership that elects under section 194 who also has separately acquired qualified timber property, the aggregate of the member's partnership and non-partnership amortizable basis may not exceed $10,000 or $5,000 whichever is applicable.
(6)
S corporations.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, rules similar to those contained in paragraph (b)(5) (ii) and (iv) of this section shall apply in the case of S corporations (as defined in section 1361(a)) and their shareholders.
(7)
Estates.
Estates may elect to amortize in each taxable year up to a maximum of $10,000 of qualifying reforestation expenditures under section 194. Any amortizable basis acquired by an estate shall be apportioned between the estate and the income beneficiary on the basis of the income of the estate allocable to each. The amount of amortizable basis apportioned from an estate to a beneficiary shall be taken into account in determining the $10,000 (or $5,000) amount of amortizable basis allowable to such beneficiary under this section.
(c)
Life tenant and remainderman.
If property is held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the life tenant is entitled to the full benefit of any amortization allowable under section 194 on qualifying expenditures he or she makes. Any remainder interest in the property is ignored for this purpose.
[T.D. 7927, 48 FR 55849, Dec. 16, 1983]
§ 1.194-3
Definitions.
(a)
Qualified timber property.
The term
qualified timber property
means property located in the United States which will contain trees in significant commercial quantities. The property may be a woodlot or other site but must consist of at least one acre which is planted with tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or reforestation. The property must be held by the taxpayer for the growing and cutting of timber which will either be sold for use in, or used by the taxpayer in, the commercial production of timber products. A taxpayer does not have to own the property in order to be eligible to elect to amortize costs attributable to it under section 194. Thus, a taxpayer may elect to amortize qualifying reforestation expenditures incurred by such taxpayer on leased qualified timber property. Qualified timber property does not include property on which the taxpayer has planted shelter belts (for which current deductions are allowed under section 175) or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees.
(b)
Amortizable basis.
The term
amortizable basis
means that portion of the basis of qualified timber property which is attributable to reforestation expenditures.
(c)
Reforestation expenditures
—(1)
In general.
The term
reforestation expenditures
means direct costs incurred to plant or seed for forestation or reforestation purposes. Qualifying expenditures include amounts spent for site preparation, seed or seedlings, and labor and tool costs, including depreciation on equipment used in planting or seeding. Only those costs which must be capitalized and are included in the adjusted basis of the property qualify as reforestation expenditures. Costs which are currently deductible do not qualify.
(2)
Cost-sharing programs.
Any expenditures for which the taxpayer has been reimbursed under any governmental reforestation cost-sharing program do not qualify as reforestation expenditures unless the amounts reimbursed
have been included in the gross income of the taxpayer.
(d)
Definitions of controlled group of corporations and component member of controlled group.
For purposes of section 194, the terms
controlled group of corporations
and
component member
of a controlled group of corporations shall have the same meaning assigned to those terms in section 1563 (a) and (b), except that the phrase “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1).
[T.D. 7927, 48 FR 55850, Dec. 16, 1983]
§ 1.194-4
Time and manner of making election.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an election to amortize reforestation expenditures under section 194 shall be made by entering the amortization deduction claimed at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's income tax return for the year in which the expenditures were incurred, and by attaching a statement to such return. The statement should state the amounts of the expenditures, describe the nature of the expenditures, and give the date on which each was incurred. The statement should also state the type of timber being grown and the purpose for which it is being grown. A separate statement must be included for each property for which reforestation expenditures are being amortized under section 194. The election may only be made on a timely return (taking into account extensions of the time for filing) for the taxable year in which the amortizable expenditures were made.
(b)
Special rule.
With respect to any return filed before March 15, 1984, on which a taxpayer was eligible to, but did not make an election under section 194, the election to amortize reforestation expenditures under section 194 may be made by a statement on, or attached to, the income tax return (or an amended return) for the taxable year, indicating that an election is being made under section 194 and setting forth the information required under paragraph (a) of this section. An election made under the provisions of this paragraph (b) must be made not later than,
(1) The time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the year in which the reforestation expenditures were made, or
(2) March 15, 1984, whichever is later. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
(c)
Revocation.
An application for consent to revoke an election under section 194 shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application shall set forth the name and address of the taxpayer, state the taxable years for which the election was in effect, and state the reason for revoking the election. The application shall be signed by the taxpayer or a duly authorized representative of the taxpayer and shall be filed at least 90 days prior to the time prescribed by law (without regard to extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election is to terminate. Ordinarily, the request for consent to revoke the election will not be granted if it appears from all the facts and circumstances that the only reason for the desired change is to obtain a tax advantage.
[T.D. 7927, 48 FR 55851, Dec. 16, 1983]
§ 1.195-1
Election to amortize start-up expenditures.
(a)
In general.
Under section 195(b), a taxpayer may elect to amortize start-up expenditures as defined in section 195(c)(1). In the taxable year in which a taxpayer begins an active trade or business, an electing taxpayer may deduct an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the start-up expenditures that relate to the active trade or business, or $5,000 (reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the start-up expenditures exceed $50,000). The remainder of the start-up expenditures is deductible ratably over the 180-month period beginning with the month in which the active trade or business begins. All start-up expenditures that relate to the active trade or business are considered in determining
whether the start-up expenditures exceed $50,000, including expenditures incurred on or before October 22, 2004.
(b)
Time and manner of making election.
A taxpayer is deemed to have made an election under section 195(b) to amortize start-up expenditures as defined in section 195(c)(1) for the taxable year in which the active trade or business to which the expenditures relate begins. A taxpayer may choose to forgo the deemed election by affirmatively electing to capitalize its start-up expenditures on a timely filed Federal income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which the active trade or business to which the expenditures relate begins. The election either to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) or to capitalize start-up expenditures is irrevocable and applies to all start-up expenditures that are related to the active trade or business. A change in the characterization of an item as a start-up expenditure is a change in method of accounting to which sections 446 and 481(a) apply if the taxpayer treated the item consistently for two or more taxable years. A change in the determination of the taxable year in which the active trade or business begins also is treated as a change in method of accounting if the taxpayer amortized start-up expenditures for two or more taxable years.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1. Expenditures of $5,000 or less
Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, incurs $3,000 of start-up expenditures after October 22, 2004, that relate to an active trade or business that begins on July 1, 2011. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct the entire amount of the start-up expenditures in 2011, the taxable year in which the active trade or business begins.

# Example 2. Expenditures of more than $5,000 but less than or equal to $50,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs start-up expenditures of $41,000. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct $5,000 and the portion of the remaining $36,000 that is allocable to July through December of 2011 ($36,000/180 × 6 = $1,200) in 2011, the taxable year in which the active trade or business begins. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $34,800 ($36,000 − $1,200 = $34,800) ratably over the remaining 174 months.

# Example 3. Subsequent change in the characterization of an item
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that Corporation X determines in 2013 that Corporation X incurred $10,000 for an additional start-up expenditure erroneously deducted in 2011 under section 162 as a business expense. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) in 2011, including the additional $10,000 of start-up expenditures. Corporation X is using an impermissible method of accounting for the additional $10,000 of start-up expenditures and must change its method under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable general administrative procedures in effect in 2013.

# Example 4. Subsequent redetermination of year in which business begins
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that, in 2012, Corporation X deducted the start-up expenditures allocable to January through December of 2012 ($36,000/180 × 12 = $2,400). In addition, in 2013 it is determined that Corporation X actually began business in 2012. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) in 2012. Corporation X impermissibly deducted start-up expenditures in 2011, and incorrectly determined the amount of start-up expenditures deducted in 2012. Therefore, Corporation X is using an impermissible method of accounting for the start-up expenditures and must change its method under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable general administrative procedures in effect in 2013.

# Example 5. Expenditures of more than $50,000 but less than or equal to $55,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs start-up expenditures of $54,500. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct $500 ($5,000 − $4,500) and the portion of the remaining $54,000 that is allocable to July through December of 2011 ($54,000/180 × 6 = $1,800) in 2011, the taxable year in which the active trade or business begins. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $52,200 ($54,000 − $1,800 = $52,200) ratably over the remaining 174 months.

# Example 6. Expenditures of more than $55,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs start-up expenditures of $450,000. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize start-up expenditures
under section 195(b) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct the amounts allocable to July through December of 2011 ($450,000/180 × 6 = $15,000) in 2011, the taxable year in which the active trade or business begins. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $435,000 ($450,000 − $15,000 = $435,000) ratably over the remaining 174 months.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to start-up expenditures paid or incurred after August 16, 2011. However, taxpayers may apply all the provisions of this section to start-up expenditures paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, provided that the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the year the election under paragraph (b) of this section is deemed made has not expired. For start-up expenditures paid or incurred on or before September 8, 2008, taxpayers may instead apply § 1.195-1, as in effect prior to that date (§ 1.195-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2008).
[T.D. 9542, 76 FR 50888, Aug. 17, 2011]
§ 1.195-2
Technical termination of a partnership.
(a)
In general.
If a partnership that has elected to amortize start-up expenditures under section 195(b) and § 1.195-1 terminates in a transaction (or a series of transactions) described in section 708(b)(1)(B) or § 1.708-1(b)(2), the termination shall not be treated as resulting in a disposition of the partnership's trade or business for purposes of section 195(b)(2). See § 1.708-1(b)(6) for rules concerning the treatment of these start-up expenditures by the new partnership.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) that occurs on or after December 9, 2013.

Certain elections for intangible property (temporary).
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for making the two elections under section 13261 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93).

Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for making the section 13261(g)(3) election (binding contract election) to apply prior law to property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on August 10, 1993, and at all times thereafter before the date of acquisition. The provisions of this section apply only to property for which an election is made under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

The eligible section 197 intangibles of a taxpayer are any section 197 intangibles that—
(i) Are transition period property; and
(ii) Qualify as amortizable section 197 intangibles (within the meaning of section 197(c)) if an election under section 13261(g)(2) of OBRA '93 applies.
(4)
Election date.
The election date is the date (determined after application of section 7502(a)) on which the taxpayer files the original or amended return to which the election statement described in paragraph (e) of this section is attached.
(5)
Election year.
The election year is the taxable year of the taxpayer that includes August 10, 1993.
(6)
Common control.
A taxpayer is under common control with the electing taxpayer if, at any time after August 2, 1993, and on or before the election date (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), the two taxpayers would be treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1) (A) or (B).
(7)
Applicable convention for sections 197 and 167(f) intangibles.
For purposes of computing the depreciation or amortization deduction allowable with respect to transition period property described in section 167(f) (1) or (3) or with respect to eligible section 197 intangibles—
(i) Property acquired at any time during the month is treated as acquired as of the first day of the month and is eligible for depreciation or amortization during the month; and
(ii) Property is not eligible for depreciation or amortization in the month of disposition.
(8)
Application to adjustment to basis of partnership property under section 734(b) or 743(b).
Any increase in the basis of partnership property under section 734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to basis of undistributed partnership property) or section 743(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property) will be taken into account under this section by a partner as if the increased portion of the basis were attributable to the partner's acquisition of the underlying partnership property on the date the distribution or transfer occurs. For example, if a section 754 election is in effect and, as a result of its acquisition of a partnership interest, a taxpayer obtains an increased basis in an intangible held through the partnership, the increased portion of the basis in the intangible will be treated as an intangible asset newly acquired by that taxpayer on the date of the transaction.
(9)
Former member.
A former member of a consolidated group is a corporation that was a member of the consolidated group at any time after July 25, 1991, and on or before August 2, 1993, but that is not under common control with the common parent of the group for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(c)
Retroactive election
—(1)
Effect of election
—(i)
On taxpayer.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, if a taxpayer makes the retroactive election, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 will apply to all the taxpayer's transition period property. Thus, for example, section 197 will apply to all the taxpayer's eligible section 197 intangibles.
(ii)
On taxpayers under common control.
If a taxpayer makes the retroactive election, the election applies to each taxpayer that is under common control with the electing taxpayer. If the retroactive election applies to a taxpayer under common control, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 apply to that taxpayer's transition period property in the same manner as if that taxpayer had itself made the retroactive election. However, a retroactive election that applies to a non-electing taxpayer under common control is not treated as an election by that taxpayer for purposes of re-applying the rule of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) to any other taxpayer.
(iii)
On former members of consolidated group.
A retroactive election by the common parent of a consolidated group applies to transition period property acquired by a former member while it was a member of the consolidated group and continues to apply to that property in each subsequent consolidated or separate return year of the former member.
(iv)
On transferred assets
—(A)
In general.
If property is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section and the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to such property in the hands of the transferor, the property remains subject to the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 with respect to so much of its
adjusted basis in the hands of the transferee as does not exceed its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor. The transferee is not required to apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to any other transition period property that it owns, however, unless such provisions are otherwise applicable under the rules of this paragraph (c)(1).
(B)
Transferee election.
If property is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section and the transferee makes the retroactive election, the transferor is not required to apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to any of its transition period property (including the property transferred to the transferee in the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section), unless such provisions are otherwise applicable under the rules of this paragraph (c)(1).
(C)
Transactions covered.
This paragraph (c)(1)(iv) applies to—
(
1
) Any transaction described in section 332, 351, 361, 721, 731, 1031, or 1033; and
(
2
) Any transaction between corporations that are members of the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction.
(D)
Exchanged basis property.
In the case of a transaction involving exchanged basis property (e.g., a transaction subject to section 1031 or 1033)—
(
1
) Paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section shall not apply; and
(
2
) If the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the property by reference to which the exchanged basis is determined (the predecessor property), the exchanged basis property becomes subject to the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 with respect to so much of its basis as does not exceed the predecessor property's basis.
(E)
Acquisition date.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section (definition of transition period property), property (other than exchanged basis property) acquired in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section generally is treated as acquired when the transferor acquired (or was treated as acquiring) the property (or predecessor property). However, if the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferor, the property, with respect to that excess basis, is treated as acquired at the time of the transfer. The time at which exchanged basis property is considered acquired is determined by applying similar principles to the transferee's acquisition of predecessor property.
(v)
Special rule for property of former member of consolidated group
—(A)
Intangibles provisions inapplicable for certain periods.
If a former member of a consolidated group makes a retroactive election pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or if an election applies to the former member under the common control rule of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 generally apply to all transition period property of the former member. The intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply, however, to the transition period property of a former member (including a former member that makes or is bound by a retroactive election) during the period beginning immediately after July 25, 1991, and ending immediately before the earlier of—
(
1
) The first day after July 25, 1991, that the former member was not a member of a consolidated group; or
(
2
) The first day after July 25, 1991, that the former member was a member of a consolidated group that is otherwise required to apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to its transition period property (e.g., because the common control election under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section applies to the group).
(B)
Subsequent adjustments.
See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for adjustments when the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to the transition period property of the former member after the property is acquired.
(2)
Making the election
—(i)
Partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of transition period property of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, only the entity may make the retroactive election for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Partnerships for which a section 754 election is in effect.
In the case of increased basis that is treated as transition period property of a partner under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, only that partner may make the retroactive election for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Consolidated groups.
An election by the common parent of a consolidated group applies to members and former members as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section. Further, for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, an election by the common parent is not treated as an election by any subsidiary member. A retroactive election cannot be made by a corporation that is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group on August 10, 1993, but an election can be made on behalf of the subsidiary member under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (e.g., by the common parent of the group). See paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for rules concerning the effect of the common parent's election on transition period property of a former member.
(3)
Time and manner of election
—(i)
Time.
In general, the retroactive election must be made by the due date (including extensions of time) of the electing taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the election year. If, however, the taxpayer's original Federal income tax return for the election year is filed before April 14, 1994, the election may be made by amending that return no later than September 12, 1994.
(ii)
Manner.
The retroactive election is made by attaching the election statement described in paragraph (e) of this section to the taxpayer's original or amended income tax return for the election year. In addition, the taxpayer must—
(A) Amend any previously filed return when required to do so under paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and
(B) Satisfy the notification requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(iii)
Effect of nonconforming elections.
An attempted election that does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) (including an attempted election made on a return for a taxable year prior to the election year) is not valid.
(4)
Amended return requirements
—(i)
Requirements.
A taxpayer subject to this paragraph (c)(4) must amend all previously filed income tax returns as necessary to conform the taxpayer's treatment of transition period property to the treatment required under the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for certain adjustments that may be required on the amended returns required under this paragraph (c)(4) in the case of certain consolidated group member dispositions and tax-free transactions.
(ii)
Applicability.
This paragraph (c)(4) applies to a taxpayer if—
(A) The taxpayer makes the retroactive election; or
(B) Another person's retroactive election applies to the taxpayer or to any property acquired by the taxpayer.
(5)
Adjustment required with respect to certain consolidated group member dispositions and tax-free transactions
—(i)
Application.
This paragraph (c)(5) applies to transition period property if the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to the property while it is held by the taxpayer but do not apply to the property for some period (the “interim period”) after the property is acquired (or considered acquired) by the taxpayer. For example, this paragraph (c)(5) may apply to transition period property held by a former member of a consolidated group if a retroactive election is made by or on behalf of the former member but is not made by the consolidated group. See paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section.
(ii)
Required adjustment to income.
If this paragraph (c)(5) applies, an adjustment must be taken into account in computing taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year in which the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to the property. The amount of the adjustment is equal to the difference for the transition period property between—
(A) The sum of the depreciation, amortization, or other cost recovery deductions that the taxpayer (and its predecessors) would have been permitted if the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the property during the interim period; and
(B) The sum of the depreciation, amortization, or other cost recovery deductions that the taxpayer (and its predecessors) claimed during that interim period.
(iii)
Required adjustment to basis.
The taxpayer also must make a corresponding adjustment to the basis of its transition period property to reflect any adjustment to taxable income with respect to the property under this paragraph (c)(5).
(6)
Notification requirements
—(i)
Notification of commonly controlled taxpayers.
A taxpayer that makes the retroactive election must provide written notification of the retroactive election (on or before the election date) to each taxpayer that is under common control with the electing taxpayer.
(ii)
Notification of certain former members, former consolidated groups, and transferees.
This paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies to a common parent of a consolidated group that makes or is notified of a retroactive election that applies to transition period property of a former member, a corporation that makes or is notified of a retroactive election that affects any consolidated group of which the corporation is a former member, or a taxpayer that makes or is notified of a retroactive election that applies to transition period property the taxpayer transfers in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section. Such common parent, former member, or transferor must provide written notification of the retroactive election to any affected former member, consolidated group, or transferee. The written notification must be provided on or before the election date in the case of an election by the common parent, former member, or transferor, and within 30 days of the election date in the case of an election by a person other than the common parent, former member, or transferor.
(7)
Revocation.
Once made, the retroactive election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c).

# Example 1.
(i) X is a partnership with 5 equal partners, A through E. X acquires in 1989, as its sole asset, intangible asset M. X has a section 754 election in effect for all relevant years. F, an unrelated individual, purchases A's entire interest in the X partnership in January 1993 for $700. At the time of F's purchase, X's inside basis for M is $2,000, and its fair market value is $3,500.
(ii) Under section 743(b), X makes an adjustment to increase F's basis in asset M by $300, the difference between the allocated purchase price and M's inside basis ($700−$400 = $300). Under paragraphs (b)(8) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if F makes the retroactive election, the section 743(b) basis increase of $300 in M is an amortizable section 197 intangible even though asset M is not an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of X. F's increase in the basis of asset M is amortizable over 15 years beginning with the month of F's acquisition of the partnership interest. With respect to the remaining $400 of basis, F is treated as stepping into A's shoes and continues A's amortization (if any) in asset M. F's retroactive election applies to all other intangibles acquired by F or a taxpayer under common control with F.

# Example 2.
A, a calendar year taxpayer, is under common control with B, a June 30 fiscal year taxpayer. A files its original election year Federal income tax return on March 15, 1994, and does not make either the retroactive election or the binding contract election. B files its election year tax return on September 15, 1994, and makes the retroactive election. B is required by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section to notify A of its election. Even though A had already filed its election year return, A is bound by B's retroactive election under the common control rules. Additionally, if A had made a binding contract election, it would have been negated by B's retroactive election. Because of B's retroactive election, A must comply with the requirements of this paragraph (c), and file amended returns for the election year and any affected prior years as necessary to conform the treatment of transition period property to the treatment required under the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93.

# Example 3.
(i) P and Y, calendar year taxpayers, are the common parents of unrelated calendar year consolidated groups. On August 15, 1991, S, a subsidiary member of the P group, acquires a section 197 intangible with an unadjusted basis of $180. Under prior law, no amortization or depreciation was allowed with respect to the acquired intangible. On November 1, 1992, a member of the Y group acquires the S stock in a taxable transaction. On the P group's 1993 consolidated return, P makes the retroactive election. The P group also files amended returns for its affected prior years. Y does not make the retroactive election for the Y group.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a retroactive election by the common parent of a consolidated group applies to all
transition period property acquired by a former member while it was a member of the group. The section 197 intangible acquired by S is transition period property that S, a former member of the P group, acquired while a member of the P group. Thus, P's election applies to the acquired asset. P must notify S of the election pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.
(iii) S amortizes the unadjusted basis of its eligible section 197 intangible ($180) over the 15-year amortization period using the applicable convention beginning as of the first day of the month of acquisition (August 1, 1991). Thus, the P group amends its 1991 consolidated tax return to take into account $5 of amortization ($180/15 years ×
5/12
year = $5) for S.
(iv) For 1992, S is entitled to $12 of amortization ($180/15). Assume that under § 1.1502-76, $10 of S's amortization for 1992 is allocated to the P group's consolidated return and $2 is allocated to the Y group's return. The P group amends its 1992 consolidated tax return to reflect the $10 deduction for S. The Y group must amend its 1992 return to reflect the $2 deduction for S.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the retroactive election is made for the Y group, not for the P group.
(ii) The Y group amends its 1992 consolidated return to claim a section 197 deduction of $2 ($180/15 years × 2/12 year = $2) for S.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the retroactive election by Y applies to all transition period property acquired by S. However, under paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply to S's transition period property during the period when it held such property as a member of P group. Instead, these provisions become applicable to S's transition period property beginning on November 1, 1992, when S becomes a member of Y group.
(iv) Because the P group did not make the retroactive election, there is an interim period during which the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply to the asset acquired by S. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Y group must take into account in computing taxable income in 1992 an adjustment equal to the difference between the section 197 deduction that would have been permitted if the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the property for the interim period (i.e., the period for which S was included in the P group's 1991 and 1992 consolidated returns) and any amortization or depreciation deductions claimed by S for the transferred intangible for that period. The retroactive election does not affect the P group, and the P group is not required to amend its returns.

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that both P and Y make the retroactive election. P must notify S of its election pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. Further, both the P and Y groups must file amended returns for affected prior years. Because there is no period of time during which the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply to the asset acquired by S, the Y group is permitted no adjustment under paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the asset.
(d)
Binding contract election
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
Effect of election.
If a taxpayer acquires property pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on August 10, 1993, and at all times thereafter before the acquisition (an eligible acquisition) and makes the binding contract election with respect to the contract, the law in effect prior to the enactment of OBRA '93 will apply to all property acquired pursuant to the contract. A separate binding contract election must be made with respect to each eligible acquisition to which the law in effect prior to the enactment of OBRA '93 is to apply.
(ii)
Taxpayers subject to retroactive election.
A taxpayer may not make the binding contract election if the taxpayer or a person under common control with the taxpayer makes the retroactive election under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Revocation.
A binding contract election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(2)
Time and manner of election
—(i)
Time.
In general, the binding contract election must be made by the due date (including extensions of time) of the electing taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the election year. If, however, the taxpayer's original Federal income tax return for the election year is filed before April 14, 1994, the election may be made by amending that return no later than September 12, 1994.
(ii)
Manner.
The binding contract election is made by attaching the election statement described in paragraph (e) of this section to the taxpayer's original or amended income tax return for the election year.
(iii)
Effect of nonconforming election.
An attempted election that does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) is not valid.
(e)
Election statement
—(1)
Filing requirements.
For an election under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section to be valid, the electing taxpayer must:
(i) File (with its Federal income tax return for the election year and with any affected amended returns required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section) a written election statement, as an attachment to Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization), that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
(ii) Forward a copy of the election statement to the Statistics Branch (QAM:S:6111), IRS Ogden Service Center, ATTN: Chief, Statistics Branch, P.O. Box 9941, Ogden, UT 84409.
(2)
Content of the election statement.
The written election statement must include the information in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (vi) and (ix) of this section in the case of a retroactive election, and the information in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (vii) through (ix) of this section in the case of a binding contract election. The required information should be arranged and identified in accordance with the following order and numbering system—
(i) The name, address and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the electing taxpayer (and the common parent if a consolidated return is filed).
(ii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the retroactive election.
(iii) Identification of the transition period property affected by the retroactive election, the name and TIN of the person from which the property was acquired, the manner and date of acquisition, the basis at which the property was acquired, and the amount of depreciation, amortization, or other cost recovery under section 167 or any other provision of the Code claimed with respect to the property.
(iv) Identification of each taxpayer under common control (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) with the electing taxpayer by name, TIN, and Internal Revenue Service Center where the taxpayer's income tax return is filed.
(v) If any persons are required to be notified of the retroactive election under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, identification of such persons and certification that written notification of the election has been provided to such persons.
(vi) A statement that the transition period property being amortized under section 197 is not subject to the anti-churning rules of section 197(f)(9).
(vii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the binding contract election.
(viii) Identification of the property affected by the binding contract election, the name and TIN of the person from which the property was acquired, the manner and date of acquisition, the basis at which the property was acquired, and whether any of the property is subject to depreciation under section 167 or to amortization or other cost recovery under any other provision of the Code.
(ix) The signature of the taxpayer or an individual authorized to sign the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(f)
Effective date.
These regulations are effective March 15, 1994.
[T.D. 8528, 59 FR 11920, Mar. 15, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9377, 73 FR 3869, Jan. 23, 2008]
§ 1.197-2
Amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
Section 197 allows an amortization deduction for the capitalized costs of an amortizable section 197 intangible and prohibits any other depreciation or amortization with respect to that property. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section provide rules and definitions for determining whether property is a section 197 intangible, and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section provide rules and definitions for determining whether a section 197 intangible is an amortizable section 197 intangible. The amortization deduction under section 197 is determined by amortizing basis ratably over a 15-year period under the rules of paragraph (f) of this section. Section 197 also includes various special rules pertaining to the disposition of amortizable section 197 intangibles, nonrecognition transactions, anti-churning rules, and anti-abuse rules. Rules relating to these provisions are contained in paragraphs (g), (h), and (j) of this section. Examples demonstrating the application of these provisions are
contained in paragraph (k) of this section. The effective date of the rules in this section is contained in paragraph (l) of this section.
(2)
Section 167(f) property.
Section 167(f) prescribes rules for computing the depreciation deduction for certain property to which section 197 does not apply. See § 1.167(a)-14 for rules under section 167(f) and paragraphs (c)(4), (6), (7), (11), and (13) of this section for a description of the property subject to section 167(f).
(3)
Amounts otherwise deductible.
Section 197 does not apply to amounts that are not chargeable to capital account under paragraph (f)(3) (relating to basis determinations for covenants not to compete and certain contracts for the use of section 197 intangibles) of this section and are otherwise currently deductible. For this purpose, an amount described in § 1.162-11 is not currently deductible if, without regard to § 1.162-11, such amount is properly chargeable to capital account.
(b)
Section 197 intangibles; in general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the term
section 197 intangible
means any property described in section 197(d)(1). The following rules and definitions provide guidance concerning property that is a section 197 intangible unless an exception applies:
(1)
Goodwill.
Section 197 intangibles include goodwill. Goodwill is the value of a trade or business attributable to the expectancy of continued customer patronage. This expectancy may be due to the name or reputation of a trade or business or any other factor.
(2)
Going concern value.
Section 197 intangibles include going concern value. Going concern value is the additional value that attaches to property by reason of its existence as an integral part of an ongoing business activity. Going concern value includes the value attributable to the ability of a trade or business (or a part of a trade or business) to continue functioning or generating income without interruption notwithstanding a change in ownership, but does not include any of the intangibles described in any other provision of this paragraph (b). It also includes the value that is attributable to the immediate use or availability of an acquired trade or business, such as, for example, the use of the revenues or net earnings that otherwise would not be received during any period if the acquired trade or business were not available or operational.
(3)
Workforce in place.
Section 197 intangibles include workforce in place. Workforce in place (sometimes referred to as agency force or assembled workforce) includes the composition of a workforce (for example, the experience, education, or training of a workforce), the terms and conditions of employment whether contractual or otherwise, and any other value placed on employees or any of their attributes. Thus, the amount paid or incurred for workforce in place includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business attributable to the existence of a highly-skilled workforce, an existing employment contract (or contracts), or a relationship with employees or consultants (including, but not limited to, any key employee contract or relationship). Workforce in place does not include any covenant not to compete or other similar arrangement described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
(4)
Information base.
Section 197 intangibles include any information base, including a customer-related information base. For this purpose, an information base includes business books and records, operating systems, and any other information base (regardless of the method of recording the information) and a customer-related information base is any information base that includes lists or other information with respect to current or prospective customers. Thus, the amount paid or incurred for information base includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business attributable to the intangible value of technical manuals, training manuals or programs, data files, and accounting or inventory control systems. Other examples include the cost of acquiring customer lists, subscription lists, insurance expirations, patient or client files, or lists of newspaper, magazine, radio, or television advertisers.
(5)
Know-how, etc.
Section 197 intangibles include any patent, copyright,
formula, process, design, pattern, know-how, format, package design, computer software (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section), or interest in a film, sound recording, video tape, book, or other similar property. (See, however, the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section.)
(6)
Customer-based intangibles.
Section 197 intangibles include any customer-based intangible. A customer-based intangible is any composition of market, market share, or other value resulting from the future provision of goods or services pursuant to contractual or other relationships in the ordinary course of business with customers. Thus, the amount paid or incurred for customer-based intangibles includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business attributable to the existence of a customer base, a circulation base, an undeveloped market or market growth, insurance in force, the existence of a qualification to supply goods or services to a particular customer, a mortgage servicing contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(11) of this section), an investment management contract, or other relationship with customers involving the future provision of goods or services. (See, however, the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section.) In addition, customer-based intangibles include the deposit base and any similar asset of a financial institution. Thus, the amount paid or incurred for customer-based intangibles also includes any portion of the purchase price of an acquired financial institution attributable to the value represented by existing checking accounts, savings accounts, escrow accounts, and other similar items of the financial institution. However, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business attributable to accounts receivable or other similar rights to income for goods or services provided to customers prior to the acquisition of a trade or business is not an amount paid or incurred for a customer-based intangible.
(7)
Supplier-based intangibles
—(i)
In general.
Section 197 intangibles include any supplier-based intangible. A
supplier-based intangible
is the value resulting from the future acquisition, pursuant to contractual or other relationships with suppliers in the ordinary course of business, of goods or services that will be sold or used by the taxpayer. Thus, the amount paid or incurred for supplier-based intangibles includes, for example, any portion of the purchase price of an acquired trade or business attributable to the existence of a favorable relationship with persons providing distribution services (such as favorable shelf or display space at a retail outlet), or the existence of favorable supply contracts. The amount paid or incurred for supplier-based intangibles does not include any amount required to be paid for the goods or services themselves pursuant to the terms of the agreement or other relationship. In addition, see the exceptions in paragraph 2(c) of this section, including the exception in paragraph 2(c)(6) of this section for certain rights to receive tangible property or services from another person.
(ii)
Applicability date.
This section applies to supplier-based intangibles acquired after July 6, 2011.
(8)
Licenses, permits, and other rights granted by governmental units.
Section 197 intangibles include any license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit (including, for purposes of section 197, an agency or instrumentality thereof) even if the right is granted for an indefinite period or is reasonably expected to be renewed for an indefinite period. These rights include, for example, a liquor license, a taxi-cab medallion (or license), an airport landing or takeoff right (sometimes referred to as a slot), a regulated airline route, or a television or radio broadcasting license. The issuance or renewal of a license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit is considered an acquisition of the license, permit, or other right. (See, however, the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section, including the exceptions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for an interest in land, paragraph (c)(6) of this section for certain rights to receive tangible property or services, paragraph (c)(8) of this section for an interest under a lease of tangible property, and paragraph (c)(13) of this section for certain rights granted by a governmental unit. See paragraph
(b)(10) of this section for the treatment of franchises.)
(9)
Covenants not to compete and other similar arrangements.
Section 197 intangibles include any covenant not to compete, or agreement having substantially the same effect, entered into in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of an interest in a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(9), an acquisition may be made in the form of an asset acquisition (including a qualified stock purchase that is treated as a purchase of assets under section 338), a stock acquisition or redemption, and the acquisition or redemption of a partnership interest. An agreement requiring the performance of services for the acquiring taxpayer or the provision of property or its use to the acquiring taxpayer does not have substantially the same effect as a covenant not to compete to the extent that the amount paid under the agreement represents reasonable compensation for the services actually rendered or for the property or use of the property actually provided.
(10)
Franchises, trademarks, and trade names.
(i) Section 197 intangibles include any franchise, trademark, or trade name. The term
franchise
has the meaning given in section 1253(b)(1) and includes any agreement that provides one of the parties to the agreement with the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or facilities, within a specified area. The term
trademark
includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, adopted and used to identify goods or services and distinguish them from those provided by others. The term
trade name
includes any name used to identify or designate a particular trade or business or the name or title used by a person or organization engaged in a trade or business. A license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit is a franchise if it otherwise meets the definition of a franchise. A trademark or trade name includes any trademark or trade name arising under statute or applicable common law, and any similar right granted by contract. The renewal of a franchise, trademark, or trade name is treated as an acquisition of the franchise, trademark, or trade name.
(ii) Notwithstanding the definitions provided in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, any amount that is paid or incurred on account of a transfer, sale, or other disposition of a franchise, trademark, or trade name and that is subject to section 1253(d)(1) is not included in the basis of a section 197 intangible. (See paragraph (g)(6) of this section.)
(11)
Contracts for the use of, and term interests in, section 197 intangibles.
Section 197 intangibles include any right under a license, contract, or other arrangement providing for the use of property that would be a section 197 intangible under any provision of this paragraph (b) (including this paragraph (b)(11)) after giving effect to all of the exceptions provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Section 197 intangibles also include any term interest (whether outright or in trust) in such property.
(12)
Other similar items.
Section 197 intangibles include any other intangible property that is similar in all material respects to the property specifically described in section 197(d)(1)(C)(i) through (v) and paragraphs (b)(3) through (7) of this section. (See paragraph (g)(5) of this section for special rules regarding certain reinsurance transactions.)
(c)
Section 197 intangibles; exceptions.
The term
section 197 intangible
does not include property described in section 197(e). The following rules and definitions provide guidance concerning property to which the exceptions apply:
(1)
Interests in a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate.
Section 197 intangibles do not include an interest in a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate. Thus, for example, amortization under section 197 is not available for the cost of acquiring stock, partnership interests, or interests in a trust or estate, whether or not the interests are regularly traded on an established market. (See paragraph (g)(3) of this section for special rules applicable to property of a partnership when a section 754 election is in effect for the partnership.)
(2)
Interests under certain financial contracts.
Section 197 intangibles do not
include an interest under an existing futures contract, foreign currency contract, notional principal contract, interest rate swap, or other similar financial contract, whether or not the interest is regularly traded on an established market. However, this exception does not apply to an interest under a mortgage servicing contract, credit card servicing contract, or other contract to service another person's indebtedness, or an interest under an assumption reinsurance contract. (See paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the treatment of assumption reinsurance contracts. See paragraph (c)(11) of this section and § 1.167(a)-14(d) for the treatment of mortgage servicing rights.)
(3)
Interests in land.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest in land. For this purpose, an interest in land includes a fee interest, life estate, remainder, easement, mineral right, timber right, grazing right, riparian right, air right, zoning variance, and any other similar right, such as a farm allotment, quota for farm commodities, or crop acreage base. An interest in land does not include an airport landing or takeoff right, a regulated airline route, or a franchise to provide cable television service. The cost of acquiring a license, permit, or other land improvement right, such as a building construction or use permit, is taken into account in the same manner as the underlying improvement.
(4)
Certain computer software
—(i)
Publicly available.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest in computer software that is (or has been) readily available to the general public on similar terms, is subject to a nonexclusive license, and has not been substantially modified. Computer software will be treated as readily available to the general public if the software may be obtained on substantially the same terms by a significant number of persons that would reasonably be expected to use the software. This requirement can be met even though the software is not available through a system of retail distribution. Computer software will not be considered to have been substantially modified if the cost of all modifications to the version of the software that is readily available to the general public does not exceed the greater of 25 percent of the price at which the unmodified version of the software is readily available to the general public or $2,000. For the purpose of determining whether computer software has been substantially modified—
(A) Integrated programs acquired in a package from a single source are treated as a single computer program; and
(B) Any cost incurred to install the computer software on a system is not treated as a cost of the software. However, the costs for customization, such as tailoring to a user's specifications (other than embedded programming options) are costs of modifying the software.
(ii)
Not acquired as part of trade or business.
Section 197 intangibles do not include an interest in computer software that is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business.
(iii)
Other exceptions.
For other exceptions applicable to computer software, see paragraph (a)(3) of this section (relating to otherwise deductible amounts) and paragraph (g)(7) of this section (relating to amounts properly taken into account in determining the cost of property that is not a section 197 intangible).
(iv)
Computer software defined.
For purposes of this section, computer software is any program or routine (that is, any sequence of machine-readable code) that is designed to cause a computer to perform a desired function or set of functions, and the documentation required to describe and maintain that program or routine. It includes all forms and media in which the software is contained, whether written, magnetic, or otherwise. Computer programs of all classes, for example, operating systems, executive systems, monitors, compilers and translators, assembly routines, and utility programs as well as application programs, are included. Computer software also includes any incidental and ancillary rights that are necessary to effect the acquisition of the title to, the ownership of, or the right to use the computer software, and that are used only in connection with that specific computer software. Such incidental and ancillary rights are not included in the
definition of trademark or trade name under paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. For example, a trademark or trade name that is ancillary to the ownership or use of a specific computer software program in the taxpayer's trade or business and is not acquired for the purpose of marketing the computer software is included in the definition of computer software and is not included in the definition of trademark or trade name. Computer software does not include any data or information base described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section unless the data base or item is in the public domain and is incidental to a computer program. For this purpose, a copyrighted or proprietary data or information base is treated as in the public domain if its availability through the computer program does not contribute significantly to the cost of the program. For example, if a word-processing program includes a dictionary feature used to spell-check a document or any portion thereof, the entire program (including the dictionary feature) is computer software regardless of the form in which the feature is maintained or stored.
(5)
Certain interests in films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, or other similar property.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest (including an interest as a licensee) in a film, sound recording, video tape, book, or other similar property (such as the right to broadcast or transmit a live event) if the interest is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business. A film, sound recording, video tape, book, or other similar property includes any incidental and ancillary rights (such as a trademark or trade name) that are necessary to effect the acquisition of title to, the ownership of, or the right to use the property and are used only in connection with that property. Such incidental and ancillary rights are not included in the definition of trademark or trade name under paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), computer software (as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section) is not treated as other property similar to a film, sound recording, video tape, or book. (See section 167 for amortization of excluded intangible property or interests.)
(6)
Certain rights to receive tangible property or services.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any right to receive tangible property or services under a contract or from a governmental unit if the right is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business. Any right that is described in the preceding sentence is not treated as a section 197 intangible even though the right is also described in section 197(d)(1)(D) and paragraph (b)(8) of this section (relating to certain governmental licenses, permits, and other rights) and even though the right fails to meet one or more of the requirements of paragraph (c)(13) of this section (relating to certain rights of fixed duration or amount). (See § 1.167(a)-14(c) (1) and (3) for applicable rules.)
(7)
Certain interests in patents or copyrights.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest (including an interest as a licensee) in a patent, patent application, or copyright that is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business. A patent or copyright includes any incidental and ancillary rights (such as a trademark or trade name) that are necessary to effect the acquisition of title to, the ownership of, or the right to use the property and are used only in connection with that property. Such incidental and ancillary rights are not included in the definition of trademark or trade name under paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. (See § 1.167(a)-14(c)(4) for applicable rules.)
(8)
Interests under leases of tangible property
—(i)
Interest as a lessor.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest as a lessor under an existing lease or sublease of tangible real or personal property. In addition, the cost of acquiring an interest as a lessor in connection with the acquisition of tangible property is taken into account as part of the cost of the tangible property. For example, if a taxpayer acquires a shopping center that is leased to tenants operating retail stores, any portion of the purchase price attributable to favorable lease terms is taken into account as part of the basis of the shopping center and in determining the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to the shopping center. (See section 167(c)(2).)
(ii)
Interest as a lessee.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest as a lessee under an existing lease of tangible real or personal property. For this purpose, an airline lease of an airport passenger or cargo gate is a lease of tangible property. The cost of acquiring such an interest is taken into account under section 178 and § 1.162-11(a). If an interest as a lessee under a lease of tangible property is acquired in a transaction with any other intangible property, a portion of the total purchase price may be allocable to the interest as a lessee based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.
(9)
Interests under indebtedness
—(i)
In general.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any interest (whether as a creditor or debtor) under an indebtedness in existence when the interest was acquired. Thus, for example, the value attributable to the assumption of an indebtedness with a below-market interest rate is not amortizable under section 197. In addition, the premium paid for acquiring a debt instrument with an above-market interest rate is not amortizable under section 197. See section 171 for rules concerning the treatment of amortizable bond premium.
(ii)
Exceptions.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(9), an interest under an existing indebtedness does not include the deposit base (and other similar items) of a financial institution. An interest under an existing indebtedness includes mortgage servicing rights, however, to the extent the rights are stripped coupons under section 1286.
(10)
Professional sports franchises.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any franchise to engage in professional baseball, basketball, football, or any other professional sport, and any item (even though otherwise qualifying as a section 197 intangible) acquired in connection with such a franchise.
(11)
Mortgage servicing rights.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any right described in section 197(e)(7) (concerning rights to service indebtedness secured by residential real property that are not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business). (See § 1.167(a)-14(d) for applicable rules.)
(12)
Certain transaction costs.
Section 197 intangibles do not include any fees for professional services and any transaction costs incurred by parties to a transaction in which all or any portion of the gain or loss is not recognized under part III of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.
(13)
Rights of fixed duration or amount.
(i) Section 197 intangibles do not include any right under a contract or any license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit if the right—
(A) Is acquired in the ordinary course of a trade or business (or an activity described in section 212) and not as part of a purchase of a trade or business;
(B) Is not described in section 197(d)(1)(A), (B), (E), or (F);
(C) Is not a customer-based intangible, a customer-related information base, or any other similar item; and
(D) Either—
(
1
) Has a fixed duration of less than 15 years; or
(
2
) Is fixed as to amount and the adjusted basis thereof is properly recoverable (without regard to this section) under a method similar to the unit-of-production method.
(ii) See § 1.167(a)-14(c)(2) and (3) for applicable rules.
(d)
Amortizable section 197 intangibles
—(1)
Definition.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), the term
amortizable section 197 intangible
means any section 197 intangible acquired after August 10, 1993 (or after July 25, 1991, if a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T has been made), and held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or an activity described in section 212.
(2)
Exception for self-created intangibles
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, amortizable section 197 intangibles do not include any section 197 intangible created by the taxpayer (a self-created intangible).
(ii)
Created by the taxpayer
—(A)
Defined.
A section 197 intangible is created by the taxpayer to the extent the taxpayer makes payments or otherwise incurs costs for its creation, production, development, or improvement, whether the actual work is performed by the taxpayer or by another person
under a contract with the taxpayer entered into before the contracted creation, production, development, or improvement occurs. For example, a technological process developed specifically for a taxpayer under an arrangement with another person pursuant to which the taxpayer retains all rights to the process is created by the taxpayer.
(B)
Contracts for the use of intangibles.
A section 197 intangible is not a self-created intangible to the extent that it results from the entry into (or renewal of) a contract for the use of an existing section 197 intangible. Thus, for example, the exception for self-created intangibles does not apply to capitalized costs, such as legal and other professional fees, incurred by a licensee in connection with the entry into (or renewal of) a contract for the use of know-how or similar property.
(C)
Improvements and modifications.
If an existing section 197 intangible is improved or otherwise modified by the taxpayer or by another person under a contract with the taxpayer, the existing intangible and the capitalized costs (if any) of the improvements or other modifications are each treated as a separate section 197 intangible for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(iii)
Exceptions.
(A) The exception for self-created intangibles does not apply to any section 197 intangible described in section 197(d)(1)(D) (relating to licenses, permits or other rights granted by a governmental unit), 197(d)(1)(E) (relating to covenants not to compete), or 197(d)(1)(F) (relating to franchises, trademarks, and trade names). Thus, for example, capitalized costs incurred in the development, registration, or defense of a trademark or trade name do not qualify for the exception and are amortized over 15 years under section 197.
(B) The exception for self-created intangibles does not apply to any section 197 intangible created in connection with the purchase of a trade or business (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section).
(C) If a taxpayer disposes of a self-created intangible and subsequently reacquires the intangible in an acquisition described in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, the exception for self-created intangibles does not apply to the reacquired intangible.
(3)
Exception for property subject to anti-churning rules.
Amortizable section 197 intangibles do not include any property to which the anti-churning rules of section 197(f)(9) and paragraph (h) of this section apply.
(e)
Purchase of a trade or business.
Several of the exceptions in section 197 apply only to property that is not acquired in (or created in connection with) a transaction or series of related transactions involving the acquisition of assets constituting a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof. Property acquired in (or created in connection with) such a transaction or series of related transactions is referred to in this section as property acquired as part of (or created in connection with) a purchase of a trade or business. For purposes of section 197 and this section, the applicability of the limitation is determined under the following rules:
(1)
Goodwill or going concern value.
An asset or group of assets constitutes a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof if their use would constitute a trade or business under section 1060 (that is, if goodwill or going concern value could under any circumstances attach to the assets). See § 1.1060-1(b)(2). For this purpose, all the facts and circumstances, including any employee relationships that continue (or covenants not to compete that are entered into) as part of the transfer of the assets, are taken into account in determining whether goodwill or going concern value could attach to the assets.
(2)
Franchise, trademark, or trade name
—(i)
In general.
The acquisition of a franchise, trademark, or trade name constitutes the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof.
(ii)
Exceptions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)—
(A) A trademark or trade name is disregarded if it is included in computer software under paragraph (c)(4) of this section or in an interest in a film, sound recording, video tape, book, or other similar property under paragraph (c)(5) of this section;
(B) A franchise, trademark, or trade name is disregarded if its value is nominal or the taxpayer irrevocably disposes of it immediately after its acquisition; and
(C) The acquisition of a right or interest in a trademark or trade name is disregarded if the grant of the right or interest is not, under the principles of section 1253, a transfer of all substantial rights to such property or of an undivided interest in all substantial rights to such property.
(3)
Acquisitions to be included.
The assets acquired in a transaction (or series of related transactions) include only assets (including a beneficial or other indirect interest in assets where the interest is of a type described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) acquired by the taxpayer and persons related to the taxpayer from another person and persons related to that other person. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), persons are related only if their relationship is described in section 267(b) or 707(b) or they are engaged in trades or businesses under common control within the meaning of section 41(f)(1).
(4)
Substantial portion.
The determination of whether acquired assets constitute a substantial portion of a trade or business is to be based on all of the facts and circumstances, including the nature and the amount of the assets acquired as well as the nature and amount of the assets retained by the transferor. The value of the assets acquired relative to the value of the assets retained by the transferor is not determinative of whether the acquired assets constitute a substantial portion of a trade or business.
(5)
Deemed asset purchases under section 338.
A qualified stock purchase that is treated as a purchase of assets under section 338 is treated as a transaction involving the acquisition of assets constituting a trade or business only if the direct acquisition of the assets of the corporation would have been treated as the acquisition of assets constituting a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof.
(6)
Mortgage servicing rights.
Mortgage servicing rights acquired in a transaction or series of related transactions are disregarded in determining for purposes of paragraph (c)(11) of this section whether the assets acquired in the transaction or transactions constitute a trade or business or substantial portion thereof.
(7)
Computer software acquired for internal use.
Computer software acquired in a transaction or series of related transactions solely for internal use in an existing trade or business is disregarded in determining for purposes of paragraph (c)(4) of this section whether the assets acquired in the transaction or series of related transactions constitute a trade or business or substantial portion thereof.
(f)
Computation of amortization deduction
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the amortization deduction allowable under section 197(a) is computed as follows:
(i) The basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible is amortized ratably over the 15-year period beginning on the later of—
(A) The first day of the month in which the property is acquired; or
(B) In the case of property held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or in an activity described in section 212, the first day of the month in which the conduct of the trade or business or the activity begins.
(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, basis is determined under section 1011 and salvage value is disregarded.
(iii) Property is not eligible for amortization in the month of disposition.
(iv) The amortization deduction for a short taxable year is based on the number of months in the short taxable year.
(2)
Treatment of contingent amounts
—(i)
Amounts added to basis during 15-year period.
Any amount that is properly included in the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible after the first month of the 15-year period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and before the expiration of that period is amortized ratably over the remainder of the 15-year period. For this purpose, the remainder of the 15-year period begins on the first day of the month in which the basis increase occurs.
(ii)
Amounts becoming fixed after expiration of 15-year period.
Any amount
that is not properly included in the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible until after the expiration of the 15-year period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section is amortized in full immediately upon the inclusion of the amount in the basis of the intangible.
(iii)
Rules for including amounts in basis.
See §§ 1.1275-4(c)(4) and 1.483-4(a) for rules governing the extent to which contingent amounts payable under a debt instrument given in consideration for the sale or exchange of an amortizable section 197 intangible are treated as payments of principal and the time at which the amount treated as principal is included in basis. See § 1.461-1(a)(1) and (2) for rules governing the time at which other contingent amounts are taken into account in determining the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible.
(3)
Basis determinations for certain assets
—(i)
Covenants not to compete.
In the case of a covenant not to compete or other similar arrangement described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section (a covenant), the amount chargeable to capital account includes, except as provided in this paragraph (f)(3), all amounts that are required to be paid pursuant to the covenant, whether or not any such amount would be deductible under section 162 if the covenant were not a section 197 intangible.
(ii)
Contracts for the use of section 197 intangibles; acquired as part of a trade or business
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (f)(3), any amount paid or incurred by the transferee on account of the transfer of a right or term interest described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section (relating to contracts for the use of, and term interests in, section 197 intangibles) by the owner of the property to which such right or interest relates and as part of a purchase of a trade or business is chargeable to capital account, whether or not such amount would be deductible under section 162 if the property were not a section 197 intangible.
(B)
Know-how and certain information base.
The amount chargeable to capital account with respect to a right or term interest described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section is determined without regard to the rule in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section if the right or interest relates to property (other than a customer-related information base) described in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section and the acquiring taxpayer establishes that—
(
1
) The transfer of the right or interest is not, under the principles of section 1235, a transfer of all substantial rights to such property or of an undivided interest in all substantial rights to such property; and
(
2
) The right or interest was transferred for an arm's-length consideration.
(iii)
Contracts for the use of section 197 intangibles; not acquired as part of a trade or business.
The transfer of a right or term interest described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section by the owner of the property to which such right or interest relates but not as part of a purchase of a trade or business will be closely scrutinized under the principles of section 1235 for purposes of determining whether the transfer is a sale or exchange and, accordingly, whether amounts paid on account of the transfer are chargeable to capital account. If under the principles of section 1235 the transaction is not a sale or exchange, amounts paid on account of the transfer are not chargeable to capital account under this paragraph (f)(3).
(iv)
Applicable rules
—(A)
Franchises, trademarks, and trade names.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), section 197 intangibles described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section do not include any property that is also described in paragraph (b)(10) of this section (relating to franchises, trademarks, and trade names).
(B)
Certain amounts treated as payable under a debt instrument
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of applying any provision of the Internal Revenue Code to a person making payments of amounts that are otherwise chargeable to capital account under this paragraph (f)(3) and are payable after the acquisition of the section 197 intangible to which they relate, such amounts are treated as payable under a debt instrument given in consideration for the sale or exchange of the section 197 intangible.
(
2
)
Rights granted by governmental units.
For purposes of applying any provision of the Internal Revenue Code to any amounts that are otherwise chargeable to capital account with respect to a license, permit, or other right described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section (relating to rights granted by a governmental unit or agency or instrumentality thereof) and are payable after the acquisition of the section 197 intangible to which they relate, such amounts are treated, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section (relating to renewal transactions), as payable under a debt instrument given in consideration for the sale or exchange of the section 197 intangible.
(
3
)
Treatment of other parties to transaction.
No person shall be treated as having sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of property in a transaction for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of the application of this paragraph (f)(3) to any other party to the transaction.
(
4
)
Basis determinations in certain transactions
—(
i
)
Certain renewal transactions.
The costs paid or incurred for the renewal of a franchise, trademark, or trade name or any license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality thereof are amortized over the 15-year period that begins with the month of renewal. Any costs paid or incurred for the issuance, or earlier renewal, continue to be taken into account over the remaining portion of the amortization period that began at the time of the issuance, or earlier renewal. Any amount paid or incurred for the protection, expansion, or defense of a trademark or trade name and chargeable to capital account is treated as an amount paid or incurred for a renewal.
(
ii
)
Transactions subject to section 338 or 1060.
In the case of a section 197 intangible deemed to have been acquired as the result of a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3), the basis shall be determined pursuant to section 338(b)(5) and the regulations thereunder. In the case of a section 197 intangible acquired in an applicable asset acquisition within the meaning of section 1060(c), the basis shall be determined pursuant to section 1060(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(

Certain reinsurance transactions.
See paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section for special rules regarding the adjusted basis of an insurance contract acquired through an assumption reinsurance transaction.

Special rules
—(1)
Treatment of certain dispositions
—(i)
Loss disallowance rules
—(A)
In general.
No loss is recognized on the disposition of an amortizable section 197 intangible if the taxpayer has any retained intangibles. The retained intangibles with respect to the disposition of any amortizable section 197 intangible (the transferred intangible) are all amortizable section 197 intangibles, or rights to use or interests (including beneficial or other indirect interests) in amortizable section 197 intangibles (including the transferred intangible) that were acquired in the same transaction or series of related transactions as the transferred intangible and are retained after its disposition. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the adjusted basis of each of the retained intangibles is increased by the product of—
(
1
) The loss that is not recognized solely by reason of this rule; and
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the adjusted basis of the retained intangible on the date of the disposition and the denominator of which is the total adjusted bases of all the retained intangibles on that date.
(B)
Abandonment or worthlessness.
The abandonment of an amortizable section 197 intangible, or any other event rendering an amortizable section 197 intangible worthless, is treated as a disposition of the intangible for purposes of this paragraph (g)(1), and the abandoned or worthless intangible is disregarded (that is, it is not treated as a retained intangible) for purposes of applying this paragraph (g)(1) to the subsequent disposition of any other amortizable section 197 intangible.
(C)
Certain nonrecognition transfers.
The loss disallowance rule in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section also applies
when a taxpayer transfers an amortizable section 197 intangible from an acquired trade or business in a transaction in which the intangible is transferred basis property and, after the transfer, retains other amortizable section 197 intangibles from the trade or business. Thus, for example, the transfer of an amortizable section 197 intangible to a corporation in exchange for stock in the corporation in a transaction described in section 351, or to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership in a transaction described in section 721, when other amortizable section 197 intangibles acquired in the same transaction are retained, followed by a sale of the stock or partnership interest received, will not avoid the application of the loss disallowance provision to the extent the adjusted basis of the transferred intangible at the time of the sale exceeds its fair market value at that time.
(ii)
Separately acquired property.
Paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to an amortizable section 197 intangible that is not acquired in a transaction or series of related transactions in which the taxpayer acquires other amortizable section 197 intangibles (a separately acquired intangible). Consequently, a loss may be recognized upon the disposition of a separately acquired amortizable section 197 intangible. However, the termination or worthlessness of only a portion of an amortizable section 197 intangible is not the disposition of a separately acquired intangible. For example, neither the loss of several customers from an acquired customer list nor the worthlessness of only some information from an acquired data base constitutes the disposition of a separately acquired intangible.
(iii)
Disposition of a covenant not to compete.
If a covenant not to compete or any other arrangement having substantially the same effect is entered into in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of an interest in one or more trades or businesses, the disposition or worthlessness of the covenant or other arrangement will not be considered to occur until the disposition or worthlessness of all interests in those trades or businesses. For example, a covenant not to compete entered into in connection with the purchase of stock continues to be amortized ratably over the 15-year recovery period (even after the covenant expires or becomes worthless) unless all the trades or businesses in which an interest was acquired through the stock purchase (or all the purchaser's interests in those trades or businesses) also are disposed of or become worthless.
(iv)
Taxpayers under common control
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, all persons that would be treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1) are treated as a single taxpayer under this paragraph (g)(1). Thus, for example, a loss is not recognized on the disposition of an amortizable section 197 intangible by a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 41(f)(5)) if, after the disposition, another member retains other amortizable section 197 intangibles acquired in the same transaction as the amortizable section 197 intangible that has been disposed of.
(B)
Treatment of disallowed loss.
If retained intangibles are held by a person other than the person incurring the disallowed loss, only the adjusted basis of intangibles retained by the person incurring the disallowed loss is increased, and only the adjusted basis of those intangibles is included in the denominator of the fraction described in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section. If none of the retained intangibles are held by the person incurring the disallowed loss, the loss is allowed ratably, as a deduction under section 197, over the remainder of the period during which the intangible giving rise to the loss would have been amortizable, except that any remaining disallowed loss is allowed in full on the first date on which all other retained intangibles have been disposed of or become worthless.
(2)
Treatment of certain nonrecognition and exchange transactions
—(i)
Relationship to anti-churning rules.
This paragraph (g)(2) provides rules relating to the treatment of section 197 intangibles acquired in certain transactions. If these rules apply to a section 197(f)(9)
intangible (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section), the intangible is, notwithstanding its treatment under this paragraph (g)(2), treated as an amortizable section 197 intangible only to the extent permitted under paragraph (h) of this section.
(ii)
Treatment of nonrecognition and exchange transactions generally
—(A)
Transfer disregarded.
If a section 197 intangible is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the transfer is disregarded in determining—
(
1
) Whether, with respect to so much of the intangible's basis in the hands of the transferee as does not exceed its basis in the hands of the transferor, the intangible is an amortizable section 197 intangible; and
(
2
) The amount of the deduction under section 197 with respect to such basis.
(B)
Application of general rule.
If the intangible described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section was an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the transferor, the transferee will continue to amortize its adjusted basis, to the extent it does not exceed the transferor's adjusted basis, ratably over the remainder of the transferor's 15-year amortization period. If the intangible was not an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the transferor, the transferee's adjusted basis, to the extent it does not exceed the transferor's adjusted basis, cannot be amortized under section 197. In either event, the intangible is treated, with respect to so much of its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferee as exceeds its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor, in the same manner for purposes of section 197 as an intangible acquired from the transferor in a transaction that is not described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. The rules of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) also apply to any subsequent transfers of the intangible in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
(C)
Transactions covered.
The transactions described in this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(C) are—
(
1
) Any transaction described in section 332, 351, 361, 721, or 731; and
(
2
) Any transaction between corporations that are members of the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction.
(iii)
Certain exchanged-basis property.
This paragraph (g)(2)(iii) applies to property that is acquired in a transaction subject to section 1031 or 1033 and is permitted to be acquired without recognition of gain (replacement property). Replacement property is treated as if it were the property by reference to which its basis is determined (the predecessor property) in determining whether, with respect to so much of its basis as does not exceed the basis of the predecessor property, the replacement property is an amortizable section 197 intangible and the amortization period under section 197 with respect to such basis. Thus, if the predecessor property was an amortizable section 197 intangible, the taxpayer will amortize the adjusted basis of the replacement property, to the extent it does not exceed the adjusted basis of the predecessor property, ratably over the remainder of the 15-year amortization period for the predecessor property. If the predecessor property was not an amortizable section 197 intangible, the adjusted basis of the replacement property, to the extent it does not exceed the adjusted basis of the predecessor property, may not be amortized under section 197. In either event, the replacement property is treated, with respect to so much of its adjusted basis as exceeds the adjusted basis of the predecessor property, in the same manner for purposes of section 197 as property acquired from the transferor in a transaction that is not subject to section 1031 or 1033.
(iv)
Transfers under section 708(b)(1)
—(A)
In general.
Paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section applies to transfers of section 197 intangibles that occur or are deemed to occur by reason of the termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1).
(B)
Termination by sale or exchange of interest.
In applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section to a partnership that is terminated pursuant to section 708(b)(1)(B) (relating to deemed terminations from the sale or exchange of an interest), the terminated partnership is treated as the transferor and the new
partnership is treated as the transferee with respect to any section 197 intangible held by the terminated partnership immediately preceding the termination. (See paragraph (g)(3) of this section for the treatment of increases in the bases of property of the terminated partnership under section 743(b).)
(C)
Other terminations.
In applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section to a partnership that is terminated pursuant to section 708(b)(1)(A) (relating to cessation of activities by a partnership), the terminated partnership is treated as the transferor and the distributee partner is treated as the transferee with respect to any section 197 intangible held by the terminated partnership immediately preceding the termination.
(3)
Increase in the basis of partnership property under section 732(b), 734(b), 743(b), or 732(d).
Any increase in the adjusted basis of a section 197 intangible under sections 732(b) or 732(d) (relating to a partner's basis in property distributed by a partnership), section 734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of undistributed partnership property after a distribution of property to a partner), or section 743(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property after transfer of a partnership interest) is treated as a separate section 197 intangible. For purposes of determining the amortization period under section 197 with respect to the basis increase, the intangible is treated as having been acquired at the time of the transaction that causes the basis increase, except as provided in § 1.743-1(j)(4)(i)(B)(
2
). The provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section apply to the extent that the amount of the basis increase is determined by reference to contingent payments. For purposes of the effective date and anti-churning provisions (paragraphs (l)(1) and (h) of this section) for a basis increase under section 732(d), the intangible is treated as having been acquired by the transferee partner at the time of the transfer of the partnership interest described in section 732(d).
(4)
Section 704(c) allocations
—(i)
Allocations where the intangible is amortizable by the contributor.
To the extent that the intangible was an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the contributing partner, a partnership may make allocations of amortization deductions with respect to the intangible to all of its partners under any of the permissible methods described in the regulations under section 704(c). See § 1.704-3.
(ii)
Allocations where the intangible is not amortizable by the contributor.
To the extent that the intangible was not an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the contributing partner, the intangible is not amortizable under section 197 by the partnership. However, if a partner contributes a section 197 intangible to a partnership and the partnership adopts the remedial allocation method for making section 704(c) allocations of amortization deductions, the partnership generally may make remedial allocations of amortization deductions with respect to the contributed section 197 intangible in accordance with § 1.704-3(d). See paragraph (h)(12) of this section to determine the application of the anti-churning rules in the context of remedial allocations.
(5)
Treatment of certain insurance contracts acquired in an assumption reinsurance transaction
—(i)
In general.
Section 197 generally applies to insurance and annuity contracts acquired from another person through an assumption reinsurance transaction.
See
§ 1.809-5(a)(7)(ii) for the definition of assumption reinsurance. The transfer of insurance or annuity contracts and the assumption of related liabilities deemed to occur by reason of a section 338 election for a target insurance company is treated as an assumption reinsurance transaction. The transfer of a reinsurance contract by a reinsurer (transferor) to another reinsurer (acquirer) is treated as an assumption reinsurance transaction if the transferor's obligations are extinguished as a result of the transaction.
(ii)
Determination of adjusted basis of amortizable section 197 intangible resulting from an assumption reinsurance transaction
—(A)
In general.
Section 197(f)(5) determines the basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible for insurance or annuity contracts acquired
in an assumption reinsurance transaction. The basis of such intangible is the excess, if any, of—
(
1
) The amount paid or incurred by the acquirer (reinsurer) under the assumption reinsurance transaction; over
(
2
) The amount, if any, required to be capitalized under section 848 in connection with such transaction.
(B)
Amount paid or incurred by acquirer (reinsurer) under the assumption reinsurance transaction.
The amount paid or incurred by the acquirer (reinsurer) under the assumption reinsurance transaction is—
(
1
) In a deemed asset sale resulting from an election under section 338, the amount of the adjusted grossed-up basis (AGUB) allocable thereto (see §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-11(b)(2));
(
2
) In an applicable asset acquisition within the meaning of section 1060, the amount of the consideration allocable thereto (see §§ 1.338-6, 1.338-11(b)(2), and 1.1060-1(c)(5)); and
(
3
) In any other transaction, the excess of the increase in the reinsurer's tax reserves resulting from the transaction (computed in accordance with sections 807, 832(b)(4)(B), and 846) over the value of the net assets received from the ceding company in the transaction.
(C)
Amount required to be capitalized under section 848 in connection with the transaction
—(1)
In general.
The amount required to be capitalized under section 848 for specified insurance contracts (as defined in section 848(e)) acquired in an assumption reinsurance transaction is the lesser of—
(
i
) The reinsurer's required capitalization amount for the assumption reinsurance transaction; or
(
ii
) The reinsurer's general deductions (as defined in section 848(c)(2)) allocable to the transaction.
(2)
Required capitalization amount.
The reinsurer determines the required capitalization amount for an assumption reinsurance transaction by multiplying the net positive or net negative consideration for the transaction by the applicable percentage set forth in section 848(c)(1) for the category of specified insurance contracts acquired in the transaction. See § 1.848-2(g)(5). If more than one category of specified insurance contracts is acquired in an assumption reinsurance transaction, the required capitalization amount for each category is determined as if the transfer of the contracts in that category were made under a separate assumption reinsurance transaction. See § 1.848-2(f)(7).
(
3
)
General deductions allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction.
The reinsurer determines the general deductions allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 1.848-2(g)(6). Accordingly, the reinsurer must allocate its general deductions to the amount required under section 848(c)(1) on specified insurance contracts that the reinsurer has issued directly before determining the general deductions allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction. For purposes of allocating its general deductions under § 1.848-2(g)(6), the reinsurer includes premiums received on the acquired specified insurance contracts after the assumption reinsurance transaction in determining the amount required under section 848(c)(1) on specified insurance contracts that the reinsurer has issued directly. If the reinsurer has entered into multiple reinsurance agreements during the taxable year, the reinsurer determines the general deductions allocable to each reinsurance agreement (including the assumption reinsurance transaction) by allocating the general deductions allocable to reinsurance agreements under § 1.848-2(g)(6) to each reinsurance agreement with a positive required capitalization amount.
(
4
)
Treatment of a capitalization shortfall allocable to the reinsurance agreement
—(i)
In general.
The reinsurer determines any capitalization shortfall allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction in the manner provided in §§ 1.848-2(g)(4) and 1.848-2(g)(7). If the reinsurer has a capitalization shortfall allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction, the ceding company must reduce the net negative consideration (as determined under § 1.848-2(f)(2)) for the transaction by the amount described in § 1.848-2(g)(3) unless the parties make the election provided in § 1.848-2(g)(8) to determine the amounts capitalized under section 848 in connection with the transaction
without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(c)(2).
(
ii
)
Treatment of additional capitalized amounts as the result of an election under § 1.848-2(g)(8).
The additional amounts capitalized by the reinsurer as the result of the election under § 1.848-2(g)(8) reduce the adjusted basis of any amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to specified insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction. If the additional capitalized amounts exceed the adjusted basis of the amortizable section 197 intangible, the reinsurer must reduce its deductions under section 805 or section 832 by the amount of such excess. The additional capitalized amounts are treated as specified policy acquisition expenses attributable to the premiums and other consideration on the assumption reinsurance transaction and are deducted ratably over a 120-month period as provided under section 848(a)(2).
(
5
)
Cross references and special rules.
In general, for rules applicable to the determination of specified policy acquisition expenses, net premiums, and net consideration, see section 848(c) and (d), and § 1.848-2(a) and (f). However, the following special rules apply for purposes of this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(C)—
(
i
) The amount required to be capitalized under section 848 in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction cannot be less than zero;
(
ii
) For purposes of determining the company's general deductions under section 848(c)(2) for the taxable year of the assumption reinsurance transaction, the reinsurer takes into account a tentative amortization deduction under section 197(a) as if the entire amount paid or incurred by the reinsurer for the specified insurance contracts were allocated to an amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to insurance contracts acquired in an assumption reinsurance transaction; and
(
iii
) Any reduction of specified policy acquisition expenses pursuant to an election under § 1.848-2(i)(4) (relating to an assumption reinsurance transaction with an insolvent insurance company) is disregarded.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g)(5)(ii):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On January 15, 2006, P acquires all of the stock of T, an insurance company, in a qualified stock purchase and makes a section 338 election for T. T issues individual life insurance contracts which are specified insurance contracts as defined in section 848(e)(1). P and new T are calendar year taxpayers. Under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-11(b)(2), the amount of AGUB allocated to old T's individual life insurance contracts is $300,000. On the acquisition date, the tax reserves for old T's individual life insurance contracts are $2,000,000. After the acquisition date, new T receives $1,000,000 of net premiums with respect to new and renewal individual life insurance contracts and incurs $100,000 of general deductions under section 848(c)(2) through December 31, 2006. New T engages in no other reinsurance transactions other than the assumption reinsurance transaction treated as occurring by reason of the section 338 election.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transfer of insurance contracts and the assumption of related liabilities deemed to occur by reason of the election under section 338 is treated as an assumption reinsurance transaction. New T determines the adjusted basis under section 197(f)(5) for the life insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction as follows. The amount paid or incurred for the individual life insurance contracts is $300,000. To determine the amount required to be capitalized under section 848 in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction, new T compares the required capitalization amount for the assumption reinsurance transaction with the general deductions allocable to the transaction. The required capitalization amount for the assumption reinsurance transaction is $130,900, which is determined by multiplying the $1,700,000 net positive consideration for the transaction ($2,000,000 reinsurance premium less $300,000 ceding commission) by the applicable percentage under section 848(c)(1) for the acquired individual life insurance contracts (7.7 percent). To determine its general deductions, new T takes into account a tentative amortization deduction under section 197(a) as if the entire amount paid or incurred for old T's individual life insurance contracts ($300,000) were allocable to an amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction. Accordingly, for the year of the assumption reinsurance transaction, new T is treated as having general deductions under section 848(c)(2) of $120,000 ($100,000 + $300,000/15). Under § 1.848-2(g)(6), these general deductions are first allocated to the $77,000 capitalization requirement for new T's directly written business ($1,000,000 × .077). Thus, $43,000 ($120,000 −
$77,000) of the general deductions are allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction. Because the general deductions allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction ($43,000) are less than the required capitalization amount for the transaction ($130,900), new T has a capitalization shortfall of $87,900 ($130,900 − $43,000) with regard to the transaction. Under § 1.848-2(g), this capitalization shortfall would cause old T to reduce the net negative consideration taken into account with respect to the assumption reinsurance transaction by $1,141,558 ($87,900 ÷ .077) unless the parties make the election under § 1.848-2(g)(8) to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction without regard to the general deductions limitation. If the parties make the election, the amount capitalized by new T under section 848 in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction would be $130,900. The $130,900 capitalized by new T under section 848 would reduce new T's adjusted basis of the amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to the specified insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction. Accordingly, new T would have an adjusted basis under section 197(f)(5) with respect to the individual life insurance contracts acquired from old T of $169,100 ($300,000 − $130,900). New T's actual amortization deduction under section 197(a) with respect to the amortizable section 197 intangible for insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction would be $11,273 ($169,100 ÷ 15).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that T only issues accident and health insurance contracts that are qualified long-term care contracts under section 7702B. Under section 7702B(a)(5), T's qualified long-term care insurance contracts are treated as guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contracts, and, therefore, are considered specified insurance contracts under section 848(e)(1). Under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-11(b)(2), the amount of AGUB allocable to T's qualified long-term care insurance contracts is $250,000. The amount of T's tax reserves for the qualified long-term care contracts on the acquisition date is $7,750,000. Following the acquisition, new T receives net premiums of $500,000 with respect to qualified long-term care contracts and incurs general deductions of $75,000 through December 31, 2006.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transfer of insurance contracts and the assumption of related liabilities deemed to occur by reason of the election under section 338 is treated as an assumption reinsurance transaction. New T determines the adjusted basis under section 197(f)(5) for the insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction as follows. The amount paid or incurred for the insurance contracts is $250,000. To determine the amount required to be capitalized under section 848 in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction, new T compares the required capitalization amount for the assumption reinsurance transaction with the general deductions allocable to the transaction. The required capitalization amount for the assumption reinsurance transaction is $577,500, which is determined by multiplying the $7,500,000 net positive consideration for the transaction ($7,750,000 reinsurance premium less $250,000 ceding commission) by the applicable percentage under section 848(c)(1) for the acquired insurance contracts (7.7 percent). To determine its general deductions, new T takes into account a tentative amortization deduction under section 197(a) as if the entire amount paid or incurred for old T's insurance contracts ($250,000) were allocable to an amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction. Accordingly, for the year of the assumption reinsurance transaction, new T is treated as having general deductions under section 848(c)(2) of $91,667 ($75,000 + $250,000 / 15). Under § 1.848-2(g)(6), these general deductions are first allocated to the $38,500 capitalization requirement for new T's directly written business ($500,000 × .077). Thus, $53,167 ($91,667 − $38,500) of general deductions are allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction. Because the general deductions allocable to the assumption reinsurance transaction ($53,167) are less than the required capitalization amount for the transaction ($577,500), new T has a capitalization shortfall of $524,333 ($577,500 − $53,167) with regard to the transaction. Under § 1.848-2(g), this capitalization shortfall would cause old T to reduce the net negative consideration taken into account with respect to the assumption reinsurance transaction by $6,809,519 ($524,333 ÷ .077) unless the parties make the election under § 1.848-2(g)(8) to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction without regard to the general deductions limitation. If the parties make the election, the amount capitalized by new T under section 848 in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction would increase from $53,167 to $577,500. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(C)(
4
) of this section, the additional $524,333 ($577,500 − $53,167) capitalized by new T under section 848 would reduce new T's adjusted basis of the amortizable section 197 intangible with respect to the insurance contracts acquired in the assumption reinsurance transaction. Accordingly, new T's adjusted basis of the section 197 intangible with regard to the insurance contracts is reduced from $196,833 ($250,000 − $53,167) to $0. Because the additional $524,333 capitalized
pursuant to the § 1.848-2(g)(8) election exceeds the $196,833 adjusted basis of the section 197 intangible before the reduction, new T is required to reduce its deductions under section 805 by the $327,500 ($524,333 − $196,833).
(E)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to acquisitions and dispositions of insurance contracts on or after April 10, 2006.
(iii)
Application of loss disallowance rule upon a disposition of an insurance contract acquired in an assumption reinsurance transaction.
The following rules apply for purposes of applying the loss disallowance rules of section 197(f)(1)(A) to the disposition of a section 197(f)(5) intangible. For this purpose, a section 197(f)(5) intangible is an amortizable section 197 intangible the basis of which is determined under section 197(f)(5).
(A)
Disposition
—(1)
In general.
A disposition of a section 197 intangible is any event as a result of which, absent section 197, recovery of basis is otherwise allowed for Federal income tax purposes.
(
2
)
Treatment of indemnity reinsurance transactions.
The transfer through indemnity reinsurance of the right to the future income from the insurance contracts to which a section 197(f)(5) intangible relates does not preclude the recovery of basis by the ceding company, provided that sufficient economic rights relating to the reinsured contracts are transferred to the reinsurer. However, the ceding company is not permitted to recover basis in an indemnity reinsurance transaction if it has a right to experience refunds reflecting a significant portion of the future profits on the reinsured contracts, or if it retains an option to reacquire a significant portion of the future profits on the reinsured contracts through the exercise of a recapture provision. In addition, the ceding company is not permitted to recover basis in an indemnity reinsurance transaction if the reinsurer assumes only a limited portion of the ceding company's risk relating to the reinsured contracts (excess loss reinsurance).
(B)
Loss.
The loss, if any, recognized by a taxpayer on the disposition of a section 197(f)(5) intangible equals the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the section 197(f)(5) intangible immediately before the disposition exceeds the amount, if any, that the taxpayer receives from another person for the future income right from the insurance contracts to which the section 197(f)(5) intangible relates. In determining the amount of the taxpayer's loss on the disposition of a section 197(f)(5) intangible through a reinsurance transaction, any effect of the transaction on the amounts capitalized by the taxpayer as specified policy acquisition expenses under section 848 is disregarded.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g)(5)(iii):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
In a prior taxable year, as a result of a section 338 election with respect to T, new T was treated as purchasing all of old T's insurance contracts that were in force on the acquisition date in an assumption reinsurance transaction. Under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-11(b)(2), the amount of AGUB allocable to the future income right from the purchased insurance contracts was $15, net of the amounts required to be capitalized under section 848 as a result of the assumption reinsurance transaction. At the beginning of the current taxable year, as a result of amortization deductions allowed by section 197(a), new T's adjusted basis in the section 197(f)(5) intangible resulting from the assumption reinsurance transaction is $12. During the current taxable year, new T enters into an indemnity reinsurance agreement with R, another insurance company, in which R assumes 100 percent of the risk relating to the insurance contracts to which the section 197(f)(5) intangible relates. In the indemnity reinsurance transaction, R agrees to pay new T a ceding commission of $10 in exchange for the future profits on the underlying reinsured policies. Under the indemnity reinsurance agreement, new T continues to administer the reinsured policies, but transfers investment assets equal to the required reserves for the reinsured policies together with all future premiums to R. The indemnity reinsurance agreement does not contain an experience refund provision or a provision allowing new T to terminate the reinsurance agreement at its sole option. New T retains the insurance licenses and other amortizable section 197 intangibles acquired in the deemed asset sale and continues to underwrite and issue new insurance contracts.
(ii)
Analysis.
The indemnity reinsurance agreement constitutes a disposition of the section 197(f)(5) intangible because it involves the transfer of sufficient economic
rights attributable to the insurance contracts to which the section 197(f)(5) intangible relates such that recovery of basis is allowed. For purposes of applying the loss disallowance rules of section 197(f)(1) and paragraph (g) of this section, new T's loss is $2 (new T's adjusted basis in the section 197(f)(5) intangible immediately before the disposition ($12) less the ceding commission ($10)). Therefore, new T applies $10 of the adjusted basis in the section 197(f)(5) intangible against the amount received from R for the future income right on the reinsured policies and increases its basis in the amortizable section 197 intangibles that it acquired and retained from the deemed asset sale by $2, the amount of the disallowed loss. The amount of new T's disallowed loss under section 197(f)(1)(A) is determined without regard to the effect of the indemnity reinsurance transaction on the amounts capitalized by new T as specified policy acquisition expenses under section 848.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that under the indemnity reinsurance agreement R agrees to pay new T a ceding commission of $5 with respect to the underlying reinsured contracts. In addition, under the indemnity reinsurance agreement, new T is entitled to an experience refund equal to any future profits on the reinsured contracts in excess of the ceding commission plus an annual risk charge. New T also has a right to recapture the business at any time after R has recovered an amount equal to the ceding commission.
(ii)
Analysis.
The indemnity reinsurance agreement between new T and R does not represent a disposition because it does not involve the transfer of sufficient economic rights with respect to the future income on the reinsured contracts. Therefore, new T may not recover its basis in the section 197(f)(5) intangible to which the contracts relate and must continue to amortize ratably the adjusted basis of the section 197(f)(5) intangible over the remainder of the 15-year recovery period and cannot apply any portion of this adjusted basis to offset the ceding commission received from R in the indemnity reinsurance transaction.
(iv)
Effective dates
—(A)
In general
—This paragraph (g)(5) applies to acquisitions and dispositions on or after April 10, 2006. For rules applicable to acquisitions and dispositions before that date, see § 1.197-2 in effect before that date (
see
26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001).
(B)
Application to pre-effective date acquisitions and dispositions.
A taxpayer may choose, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to apply the provisions of this paragraph (g)(5) to property acquired and disposed of before April 10, 2006.
(C)
Change in method of accounting
—(
1
)
In general
—A change in a taxpayer's treatment of all property acquired and disposed under paragraph (g)(5) is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the regulations thereunder apply.
(
2
)
Acquisitions and dispositions on or after effective date.
A Taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner under section 446(e) to change its method of accounting to comply with this paragraph (g)(5) for acquisitions and dispositions on or after April 10, 2006. The change must be made on a cut-off basis with no section 481(a) adjustment. Notwithstanding § 1.446-1(e)(3), a taxpayer should not file a Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” to obtain the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting under this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(C)(
2
). Instead, a taxpayer must make the change by using the new method on its federal income tax returns.
(
3
)
Acquisitions and dispositions before the effective date.
For the first taxable year ending after April 10, 2006, a taxpayer is granted consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting for all property acquired in transactions described in paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(B) to comply with this paragraph (g)(5) unless the proper treatment of any such property is an issue under consideration in an examination, before an Appeals office, or before a Federal Court. (For the definition of when an issue is under consideration, see, Rev. Proc. 97-27 (1997-1 C.B. 680); and, § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). A taxpayer changing its method of accounting in accordance with this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(C)(
3
) must follow the applicable administrative procedures for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, see, for example, Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 C.B. 327) as modified and clarified by Announcement 2002-17 (2002-1 C.B. 561), modified and amplified by Rev. Proc. 2002-19 (2002-1 C.B. 696), and amplified, clarified and modified by Rev. Proc. 2002-54 (2002-2 C.B. 432); and,
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), except, for purposes of this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(C)(
3
), any limitations in such administrative procedures for obtaining the automatic consent of the Commissioner shall not apply. However, if the taxpayer is under examination, before an appeals office, or before a Federal court, the taxpayer must provide a copy of the application to the examining agent(s), appeals officer, or counsel for the government, as appropriate, at the same time that it files the copy of the application with the National Office. The application must contain the name(s) and telephone number(s) of the examining agent(s), appeals officer, or counsel for the government, as appropriate. For purposes of From 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” the designated number for the automatic accounting method change authorized by this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(C)(
3
) is “98.” A change in method of accounting in accordance with this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(C)(
3
) requires an adjustment under section 481(a).
(6)
Amounts paid or incurred for a franchise, trademark, or trade name.
If an amount to which section 1253(d) (relating to the transfer, sale, or other disposition of a franchise, trademark, or trade name) applies is described in section 1253(d)(1)(B) (relating to contingent serial payments deductible under section 162), the amount is not included in the adjusted basis of the intangible for purposes of section 197. Any other amount, whether fixed or contingent, to which section 1253(d) applies is chargeable to capital account under section 1253(d)(2) and is amortizable only under section 197.
(7)
Amounts properly taken into account in determining the cost of property that is not a section 197 intangible.
Section 197 does not apply to an amount that is properly taken into account in determining the cost of property that is not a section 197 intangible. The entire cost of acquiring the other property is included in its basis and recovered under other applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions. Thus, for example, section 197 does not apply to the cost of an interest in computer software to the extent such cost is included, without being separately stated, in the cost of the hardware or other tangible property and is consistently treated as part of the cost of the hardware or other tangible property.
(8)
Treatment of amortizable section 197 intangibles as depreciable property.
An amortizable section 197 intangible is treated as property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. Thus, for example, an amortizable section 197 intangible is not a capital asset for purposes of section 1221, but if used in a trade or business and held for more than one year, gain or loss on its disposition generally qualifies as section 1231 gain or loss. Also, an amortizable section 197 intangible is section 1245 property and section 1239 applies to any gain recognized upon its sale or exchange between related persons (as defined in section 1239(b)).
(h)
Anti-churning rules
—(1)
Scope and purpose
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (h) applies to section 197(f)(9) intangibles. For this purpose, section 197(f)(9) intangibles are goodwill and going concern value that was held or used at any time during the transition period and any other section 197 intangible that was held or used at any time during the transition period and was not depreciable or amortizable under prior law.
(ii)
Purpose.
To qualify as an amortizable section 197 intangible, a section 197 intangible must be acquired after the applicable date (July 25, 1991, if the acquiring taxpayer has made a valid retroactive election pursuant to § 1.197-1T; August 10, 1993, in all other cases). The purpose of the anti-churning rules of section 197(f)(9) and this paragraph (h) is to prevent the amortization of section 197(f)(9) intangibles unless they are transferred after the applicable effective date in a transaction giving rise to a significant change in ownership or use. (Special rules apply for purposes of determining whether transactions involving partnerships give rise to a significant change in ownership or use. See paragraph (h)(12) of this section.) The anti-churning rules are to be applied in a manner that carries out their purpose.
(2)
Treatment of section 197(f)(9) intangibles.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), a section 197(f)(9)
intangible acquired by a taxpayer after the applicable effective date does not qualify for amortization under section 197 if—
(i) The taxpayer or a related person held or used the intangible or an interest therein at any time during the transition period;
(ii) The taxpayer acquired the intangible from a person that held the intangible at any time during the transition period and, as part of the transaction, the user of the intangible does not change; or
(iii) The taxpayer grants the right to use the intangible to a person that held or used the intangible at any time during the transition period (or to a person related to that person), but only if the transaction in which the taxpayer grants the right and the transaction in which the taxpayer acquired the intangible are part of a series of related transactions.
(3)
Amounts deductible under section 1253(d) or § 1.162-11.
For purposes of this paragraph (h), deductions allowable under section 1253(d)(2) or pursuant to an election under section 1253(d)(3) (in either case as in effect prior to the enactment of section 197) and deductions allowable under § 1.162-11 are treated as deductions allowable for amortization under prior law.
(4)
Transition period.
For purposes of this paragraph (h), the transition period is July 25, 1991, if the acquiring taxpayer has made a valid retroactive election pursuant to § 1.197-1T and the period beginning on July 25, 1991, and ending on August 10, 1993, in all other cases.
(5)
Exceptions.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to—
(i) The acquisition of a section 197(f)(9) intangible if the acquiring taxpayer's basis in the intangible is determined under section 1014(a) or 1022; or
(ii) The acquisition of a section 197(f)(9) intangible that was an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the seller (or transferor), but only if the acquisition transaction and the transaction in which the seller (or transferor) acquired the intangible or interest therein are not part of a series of related transactions.
(6)
Related person
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, a person is related to another person for purposes of this paragraph (h) if—
(A) The person bears a relationship to that person that would be specified in section 267(b) (determined without regard to section 267(e)) and, by substitution, section 267(f)(1), if those sections were amended by substituting 20 percent for 50 percent; or
(B) The person bears a relationship to that person that would be specified in section 707(b)(1) if that section were amended by substituting 20 percent for 50 percent; or
(C) The persons are engaged in trades or businesses under common control (within the meaning of section 41(f)(1) (A) and (B)).
(ii)
Time for testing relationships.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of this section, a person is treated as related to another person for purposes of this paragraph (h) if the relationship exists—
(A) In the case of a single transaction, immediately before or immediately after the transaction in which the intangible is acquired; and
(B) In the case of a series of related transactions (or a series of transactions that together comprise a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3)), immediately before the earliest such transaction or immediately after the last such transaction.
(iii)
Certain relationships disregarded.
In applying the rules in paragraph (h)(7) of this section, if a person acquires an intangible in a series of related transactions in which the person acquires stock (meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)) of a corporation in a fully taxable transaction followed by a liquidation of the acquired corporation under section 331, any relationship created as part of such series of transactions is disregarded in determining whether any person is related to such acquired corporation immediately after the last transaction.
(iv)
De minimis rule
—(A)
In general.
Two corporations are not treated as related persons for purposes of this paragraph (h) if—
(
1
) The corporations would (but for the application of this paragraph (h)(6)(iv)) be treated as related persons solely by reason of substituting “more than 20 percent” for “more than 50 percent” in section 267(f)(1)(A); and
(
2
) The beneficial ownership interest of each corporation in the stock of the other corporation represents less than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and less than 10 percent of the total value of the shares of all classes of stock outstanding.
(B)
Determination of beneficial ownership interest.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(6)(iv), the beneficial ownership interest of one corporation in the stock of another corporation is determined under the principles of section 318(a), except that—
(
1
) In applying section 318(a)(2)(C), the 50-percent limitation contained therein is not applied; and
(
2
) Section 318(a)(3)(C) is applied by substituting “20 percent” for “50 percent”.
(7)
Special rules for entities that owned or used property at any time during the transition period and that are no longer in existence.
A corporation, partnership, or trust that owned or used a section 197 intangible at any time during the transition period and that is no longer in existence is deemed, for purposes of determining whether a taxpayer acquiring the intangible is related to such entity, to be in existence at the time of the acquisition.
(8)
Special rules for section 338 deemed acquisitions.
In the case of a qualified stock purchase that is treated as a deemed sale and purchase of assets pursuant to section 338, the corporation treated as purchasing assets as a result of an election thereunder (new target) is not considered the person that held or used the assets during any period in which the assets were held or used by the corporation treated as selling the assets (old target). Thus, for example, if a corporation (the purchasing corporation) makes a qualified stock purchase of the stock of another corporation after the transition period, new target will not be treated as the owner during the transition period of assets owned by old target during that period even if old target and new target are treated as the same corporation for certain other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code or old target and new target are the same corporation under the laws of the State or other jurisdiction of its organization. However, the anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) may nevertheless apply to a deemed asset purchase resulting from a section 338 election if new target is related (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(6) of this section) to old target.
(9)
Gain-recognition exception
—(i)
Applicability.
A section 197(f)(9) intangible qualifies for the gain-recognition exception if—
(A) The taxpayer acquires the intangible from a person that would not be related to the taxpayer but for the substitution of 20 percent for 50 percent under paragraph (h)(6)(i)(A) of this section; and
(B) That person (whether or not otherwise subject to Federal income tax) elects to recognize gain on the disposition of the intangible and agrees, notwithstanding any other provision of law or treaty, to pay for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs an amount of tax on the gain that, when added to any other Federal income tax on such gain, equals the gain on the disposition multiplied by the highest marginal rate of tax for that taxable year.
(ii)
Effect of exception.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) apply to a section 197(f)(9) intangible that qualifies for the gain-recognition exception only to the extent the acquiring taxpayer's basis in the intangible exceeds the gain recognized by the transferor.
(iii)
Time and manner of election.
The election described in this paragraph (h)(9) must be made by the due date (including extensions of time) of the electing taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. The election is made by attaching an election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (h)(9)(viii) of this section to the electing taxpayer's original or amended income tax return for that taxable year (or by filing the statement as a return for the taxable year under paragraph (h)(9)(xi) of this section). In addition, the taxpayer must
satisfy the notification requirements of paragraph (h)(9)(vi) of this section. The election is binding on the taxpayer and all parties whose Federal tax liability is affected by the election.
(iv)
Special rules for certain entities.
In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate or trust, the election under this paragraph (h)(9) is made by the entity rather than by its owners or beneficiaries. If a partnership or S corporation makes an election under this paragraph (h)(9) with respect to the disposition of a section 197(f)(9) intangible, each of its partners or shareholders is required to pay a tax determined in the manner described in paragraph (h)(9)(i)(B) of this section on the amount of gain that is properly allocable to such partner or shareholder with respect to the disposition.
(v)
Effect of nonconforming elections.
An attempted election that does not substantially comply with each of the requirements of this paragraph (h)(9) is disregarded in determining whether a section 197(f)(9) intangible qualifies for the gain-recognition exception.
(vi)
Notification requirements.
A taxpayer making an election under this paragraph (h)(9) with respect to the disposition of a section 197(f)(9) intangible must provide written notification of the election on or before the due date of the return on which the election is made to the person acquiring the section 197 intangible. In addition, a partnership or S corporation making an election under this paragraph (h)(9) must attach to the Schedule K-1 furnished to each partner or shareholder a written statement containing all information necessary to determine the recipient's additional tax liability under this paragraph (h)(9).
(vii)
Revocation.
An election under this paragraph (h)(9) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(viii)
Election Statement.
An election statement satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (h)(9)(viii) if it is in writing and contains the information listed below. The required information should be arranged and identified in accordance with the following order and numbering system:
(A) The name and address of the electing taxpayer.
(B) Except in the case of a taxpayer that is not otherwise subject to Federal income tax, the taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the electing taxpayer.
(C) A statement that the taxpayer is making the election under section 197(f)(9)(B).
(D) Identification of the transaction and each person that is a party to the transaction or whose tax return is affected by the election (including, except in the case of persons not otherwise subject to Federal income tax, the TIN of each such person).
(E) The calculation of the gain realized, the applicable rate of tax, and the amount of the taxpayer's additional tax liability under this paragraph (h)(9).
(F) The signature of the taxpayer or an individual authorized to sign the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(ix)
Determination of highest marginal rate of tax and amount of other Federal income tax on gain
—(A)
Marginal rate.
The following rules apply for purposes of determining the highest marginal rate of tax applicable to an electing taxpayer:
(
1
)
Noncorporate taxpayers.
In the case of an individual, estate, or trust, the highest marginal rate of tax is the highest marginal rate of tax in effect under section 1, determined without regard to section 1(h).
(
2
)
Corporations and tax-exempt entities.
In the case of a corporation or an entity that is exempt from tax under section 501(a), the highest marginal rate of tax is the highest marginal rate of tax in effect under section 11, determined without regard to any rate that is added to the otherwise applicable rate in order to offset the effect of the graduated rate schedule.
(B)
Other Federal income tax on gain.
The amount of Federal income tax (other than the tax determined under this paragraph (h)(9)) imposed on any gain is the lesser of—
(
1
) The amount by which the taxpayer's Federal income tax liability (determined without regard to this paragraph (h)(9)) would be reduced if the amount of such gain were not taken into account; or
(
2
) The amount of the gain multiplied by the highest marginal rate of tax for the taxable year.
(x)
Coordination with other provisions
—(A)
In general.
The amount of gain subject to the tax determined under this paragraph (h)(9) is not reduced by any net operating loss deduction under section 172(a), any capital loss under section 1212, or any other similar loss or deduction. In addition, the amount of tax determined under this paragraph (h)(9) is not reduced by any credit of the taxpayer. In computing the amount of any net operating loss, capital loss, or other similar loss or deduction, or any credit that may be carried to any taxable year, any gain subject to the tax determined under this paragraph (h)(9) and any tax paid under this paragraph (h)(9) is not taken into account.
(B)
Section 1374.
No provision of paragraph (h)(9)(iv) of this section precludes the application of section 1374 (relating to a tax on certain built-in gains of S corporations) to any gain with respect to which an election under this paragraph (h)(9) is made. In addition, neither paragraph (h)(9)(iv) nor paragraph (h)(9)(x)(A) of this section precludes a taxpayer from applying the provisions of section 1366(f)(2) (relating to treatment of the tax imposed by section 1374 as a loss sustained by the S corporation) in determining the amount of tax payable under paragraph (h)(9) of this section.
(C)
Procedural and administrative provisions.
For purposes of subtitle F, the amount determined under this paragraph (h)(9) is treated as a tax imposed by section 1 or 11, as appropriate.
(D)
Installment method.
The gain subject to the tax determined under paragraph (h)(9)(i) of this section may not be reported under the method described in section 453(a). Any such gain that would, but for the application of this paragraph (h)(9)(x)(D), be taken into account under section 453(a) shall be taken into account in the same manner as if an election under section 453(d) (relating to the election not to apply section 453(a)) had been made.
(xi)
Special rules for persons not otherwise subject to Federal income tax.
If the person making the election under this paragraph (h)(9) with respect to a disposition is not otherwise subject to Federal income tax, the election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (h)(9)(viii) of this section must be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(9) and subtitle F, the statement is treated as an income tax return for the calendar year in which the disposition occurs and as a return due on or before March 15 of the following year.
(10)
Transactions subject to both anti-churning and nonrecognition rules.
If a person acquires a section 197(f)(9) intangible in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section from a person in whose hands the intangible was an amortizable section 197 intangible, and immediately after the transaction (or series of transactions described in paragraph (h)(6)(ii)(B) of this section) in which such intangible is acquired, the person acquiring the section 197(f)(9) intangible is related to any person described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the intangible is, notwithstanding its treatment under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, treated as an amortizable section 197 intangible only to the extent permitted under this paragraph (h). (See, for example, paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section.)
(11)
Avoidance purpose.
A section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by a taxpayer after the applicable effective date does not qualify for amortization under section 197 if one of the principal purposes of the transaction in which it is acquired is to avoid the operation of the anti-churning rules of section 197(f)(9) and this paragraph (h). A transaction will be presumed to have a principal purpose of avoidance if it does not effect a significant change in the ownership or use of the intangible. Thus, for example, if section 197(f)(9) intangibles are acquired in a transaction (or series of related transactions) in which an option to acquire stock is issued to a party to the transaction, but the option is not treated as having been exercised for purposes of paragraph (h)(6) of this section, this paragraph (h)(11) may apply to the transaction.
(12)
Additional partnership anti-churning rules
—(i)
In general.
In determining whether the anti-churning rules of this
paragraph (h) apply to any increase in the basis of a section 197(f)(9) intangible under section 732(b), 732(d), 734(b), or 743(b), the determinations are made at the partner level and each partner is treated as having owned and used the partner's proportionate share of partnership property. In determining whether the anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) apply to any transaction under another section of the Internal Revenue Code, the determinations are made at the partnership level, unless under § 1.701-2(e) the Commissioner determines that the partner level is more appropriate.
(ii)
Section 732(b) adjustments
—(A)
In general.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) apply to any increase in the adjusted basis of a section 197(f)(9) intangible under section 732(b) to the extent that the basis increase exceeds the total unrealized appreciation from the intangible allocable to—
(
1
) Partners other than the distributee partner or persons related to the distributee partner;
(
2
) The distributee partner and persons related to the distributee partner if the distributed intangible is a section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by the partnership on or before August 10, 1993, to the extent that—
(
i
) The distributee partner and related persons acquired an interest or interests in the partnership after August 10, 1993;
(
ii
) Such interest or interests were held after August 10, 1993, by a person or persons other than either the distributee partner or persons who were related to the distributee partner; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest or interests by such person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the distributee partner (or persons related to the distributee partner) subsequently acquired such interest or interests; and
(
3
) The distributee partner and persons related to the distributee partner if the distributed intangible is a section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by the partnership after August 10, 1993, that is not amortizable with respect to the partnership, to the extent that—
(
i
) The distributee partner and persons related to the distributee partner acquired an interest or interests in the partnership after the partnership acquired the distributed intangible;
(
ii
) Such interest or interests were held after the partnership acquired the distributed intangible, by a person or persons other than either the distributee partner or persons who were related to the distributee partner; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest or interests by such person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the distributee partner (or persons related to the distributee partner) subsequently acquired such interest or interests.
(B)
Effect of retroactive elections.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(ii)(A) of this section, references to August 10, 1993, are treated as references to July 25, 1991, if the relevant party made a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T.
(C)
Intangible still subject to anti-churning rules.
Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(12)(ii) of this section, in applying the provisions of this paragraph (h) with respect to subsequent transfers, the distributed intangible remains subject to the provisions of this paragraph (h) in proportion to a fraction (determined at the time of the distribution), as follows—
(
1
) The numerator of which is equal to the sum of—
(
i
) The amount of the distributed intangible's basis that is nonamortizable under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and
(
ii
) The total unrealized appreciation inherent in the intangible reduced by the amount of the increase in the adjusted basis of the distributed intangible under section 732(b) to which the anti-churning rules do not apply; and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the fair market value of such intangible.
(D)
Partner's allocable share of unrealized appreciation from the intangible.
The amount of unrealized appreciation from an intangible that is allocable to a partner is the amount of taxable gain that would have been allocated to that partner if the partnership had sold the intangible immediately before the distribution for its fair market value in a fully taxable transaction.
(E)
Acquisition of partnership interest by contribution.
Solely for purposes of paragraphs (h)(12)(ii)(A)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section, a partner who acquires an interest in a partnership in exchange for a contribution of property to the partnership is deemed to acquire a pro rata portion of that interest in the partnership from each person who is a partner in the partnership at the time of the contribution based on each partner's respective proportionate interest in the partnership.
(iii)
Section 732(d) adjustments.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to an increase in the basis of a section 197(f)(9) intangible under section 732(d) if, had an election been in effect under section 754 at the time of the transfer of the partnership interest, the distributee partner would have been able to amortize the basis adjustment made pursuant to section 743(b).
(iv)
Section 734(b) adjustments
—(A)
In general.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to a continuing partner's share of an increase in the basis of a section 197(f)(9) intangible held by a partnership under section 734(b) to the extent that the continuing partner is an eligible partner.
(B)
Eligible partner.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(12)(iv), eligible partner means—
(
1
) A continuing partner that is not the distributee partner or a person related to the distributee partner;
(
2
) A continuing partner that is the distributee partner or a person related to the distributee partner, with respect to any section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by the partnership on or before August 10, 1993, to the extent that—
(
i
) The distributee partner's interest in the partnership was acquired after August 10, 1993;
(
ii
) Such interest was held after August 10, 1993 by a person or persons who were not related to the distributee partner; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest by such person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the distributee partner or persons related to the distributee partner subsequently acquired such interest; or
(
3
) A continuing partner that is the distributee partner or a person related to the distributee partner, with respect to any section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by the partnership after August 10, 1993, that is not amortizable with respect to the partnership, to the extent that—
(
i
) The distributee partner's interest in the partnership was acquired after the partnership acquired the relevant intangible;
(
ii
) Such interest was held after the partnership acquired the relevant intangible by a person or persons who were not related to the distributee partner; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest by such person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the distributee partner or persons related to the distributee partner subsequently acquired such interest.
(C)
Effect of retroactive elections.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(A) of this section, references to August 10, 1993, are treated as references to July 25, 1991, if the distributee partner made a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T.
(D)
Partner's share of basis increase
—(
1
) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(D)(
2
) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (h)(12)(iv), a continuing partner's share of a basis increase under section 734(b) is equal to—
(
i
) The total basis increase allocable to the intangible; multiplied by
(
ii
) A fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the continuing partner's post-distribution capital account (determined immediately after the distribution in accordance with the capital accounting rules of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)), and the denominator of which is the total amount of the post-distribution capital accounts (determined immediately after the distribution in accordance with the capital accounting rules of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)) of all continuing partners.
(
2
)
Exception where partnership does not maintain capital accounts.
If a partnership does not maintain capital accounts in accordance with § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), then for purposes of this paragraph (h)(12)(iv), a continuing
partner's share of a basis increase is equal to—
(
i
) The total basis increase allocable to the intangible; multiplied by
(
ii
) The partner's overall interest in the partnership as determined under § 1.704-1(b)(3) immediately after the distribution.
(E)
Interests acquired by contribution
—(
1
)
Application of paragraphs (h)(12)(iv)(B) (2) and (3) of this section.
Solely for purposes of paragraphs (h)(12)(iv)(B)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section, a partner who acquires an interest in a partnership in exchange for a contribution of property to the partnership is deemed to acquire a pro rata portion of that interest in the partnership from each person who is a partner in the partnership at the time of the contribution based on each such partner's proportionate interest in the partnership.
(
2
)
Special rule with respect to paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(B)(1) of this section.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section, if a distribution that gives rise to an increase in the basis under section 734(b) of a section 197(f)(9) intangible held by the partnership is undertaken as part of a series of related transactions that include a contribution of the intangible to the partnership by a continuing partner, the continuing partner is treated as related to the distributee partner in analyzing the basis adjustment with respect to the contributed section 197(f)(9) intangible.
(F)
Effect of section 734(b) adjustments on partners' capital accounts.
If one or more partners are subject to the anti-churning rules under this paragraph (h) with respect to a section 734(b) adjustment allocable to an intangible asset, taxpayers may use any reasonable method to determine amortization of the asset for book purposes, provided that the method used does not contravene the purposes of the anti-churning rules under section 197 and this paragraph (h). A method will be considered to contravene the purposes of the anti-churning rules if the effect of the book adjustments resulting from the method is such that any portion of the tax deduction for amortization attributable to the section 734 adjustment is allocated, directly or indirectly, to a partner who is subject to the anti-churning rules with respect to such adjustment.
(v)
Section 743(b) adjustments
—(A)
General rule.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to an increase in the basis of a section 197 intangible under section 743(b) if the person acquiring the partnership interest is not related to the person transferring the partnership interest. In addition, the anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to an increase in the basis of a section 197 intangible under section 743(b) to the extent that—
(
1
) The partnership interest being transferred was acquired after August 10, 1993, provided—
(
i
) The section 197(f)(9) intangible was acquired by the partnership on or before August 10, 1993;
(
ii
) The partnership interest being transferred was held after August 10, 1993, by a person or persons (the post-1993 person or persons) other than the person transferring the partnership interest or persons who were related to the person transferring the partnership interest; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest by the post-1993 person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the person transferring the partnership interest or persons related to the person transferring the partnership interest acquired such interest; or
(
2
) The partnership interest being transferred was acquired after the partnership acquired the section 197(f)(9) intangible, provided—
(
i
) The section 197(f)(9) intangible was acquired by the partnership after August 10, 1993, and is not amortizable with respect to the partnership;
(
ii
) The partnership interest being transferred was held after the partnership acquired the section 197(f)(9) intangible by a person or persons (the post-contribution person or persons) other than the person transferring the partnership interest or persons who were related to the person transferring the partnership interest; and
(
iii
) The acquisition of such interest by the post-contribution person or persons was not part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which
the person transferring the partnership interest or persons related to the person transferring the partnership interest acquired such interest.
(B)
Acquisition of partnership interest by contribution.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(v)(A) (
1
) and (
2
) of this section, a partner who acquires an interest in a partnership in exchange for a contribution of property to the partnership is deemed to acquire a pro rata portion of that interest in the partnership from each person who is a partner in the partnership at the time of the contribution based on each such partner's proportionate interest in the partnership.
(C)
Effect of retroactive elections.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(v)(A) of this section, references to August 10, 1993, are treated as references to July 25, 1991, if the transferee partner made a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T.
(vi)
Partner is or becomes a user of partnership intangible
—(A)
General rule.
If, as part of a series of related transactions that includes a transaction described in paragraph (h)(12)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, an anti-churning partner or related person (other than the partnership) becomes (or remains) a direct user of an intangible that is treated as transferred in the transaction (as a result of the partners being treated as having owned their proportionate share of partnership assets), the anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) apply to the proportionate share of such intangible that is treated as transferred by such anti-churning partner, notwithstanding the application of paragraph (h)(12)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.
(B)
Anti-churning partner.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(12)(vi), anti-churning partner means—
(
1
) With respect to all intangibles held by a partnership on or before August 10, 1993, any partner, but only to the extent that
(
i
) The partner's interest in the partnership was acquired on or before August 10, 1993, or
(
ii
) The interest was acquired from a person related to the partner on or after August 10, 1993, and such interest was not held by any person other than persons related to such partner at any time after August 10, 1993 (disregarding, for this purpose, a person's holding of an interest if the acquisition of such interest was part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the partner or persons related to the partner subsequently acquired such interest),
(
2
) With respect to any section 197(f)(9) intangible acquired by a partnership after August 10, 1993, that is not amortizable with respect to the partnership, any partner, but only to the extent that
(
i
) The partner's interest in the partnership was acquired on or before the date the partnership acquired the section 197(f)(9) intangible, or
(
ii
) The interest was acquired from a person related to the partner on or after the date the partnership acquired the section 197(f)(9) intangible, and such interest was not held by any person other than persons related to such partner at any time after the date the partnership acquired the section 197(f)(9) intangible (disregarding, for this purpose, a person's holding of an interest if the acquisition of such interest was part of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the partner or persons related to the partner subsequently acquired such interest).
(C)
Effect of retroactive elections.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(12)(vi)(B) of this section, references to August 10, 1993, are treated as references to July 25, 1991, if the relevant party made a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T.
(vii)
Section 704(c) allocations
—(A)
Allocations where the intangible is amortizable by the contributor.
The anti-churning rules of this paragraph (h) do not apply to the curative or remedial allocations of amortization with respect to a section 197(f)(9) intangible if the intangible was an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the contributing partner (unless paragraph (h)(10) of this section applies so as to cause the intangible to cease to be an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the partnership).
(B)
Allocations where the intangible is not amortizable by the contributor.
If a section 197(f)(9) intangible was not an amortizable section 197 intangible in
the hands of the contributing partner, a non-contributing partner generally may receive remedial allocations of amortization under section 704(c) that are deductible for Federal income tax purposes. However, such a partner may not receive remedial allocations of amortization under section 704(c) if that partner is related to the partner that contributed the intangible or if, as part of a series of related transactions that includes the contribution of the section 197(f)(9) intangible to the partnership, the contributing partner or related person (other than the partnership) becomes (or remains) a direct user of the contributed intangible. Taxpayers may use any reasonable method to determine amortization of the asset for book purposes, provided that the method used does not contravene the purposes of the anti-churning rules under section 197 and this paragraph (h). A method will be considered to contravene the purposes of the anti-churning rules if the effect of the book adjustments resulting from the method is such that any portion of the tax deduction for amortization attributable to section 704(c) is allocated, directly or indirectly, to a partner who is subject to the anti-churning rules with respect to such adjustment.
(C)
Rules for section 721(c) partnerships.
See § 1.704-3(d)(5)(iii) if there is a contribution of a section 197(f)(9) intangible to a section 721(c) partnership (as defined in § 1.721(c)-1(b)(14)).
(viii)
Operating rule for transfers upon death.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(12), if the basis of a partner's interest in a partnership is determined under section 1014(a) or 1022, such partner is treated as acquiring such interest from a person who is not related to such partner, and such interest is treated as having previously been held by a person who is not related to such partner.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
General anti-abuse rule.
The Commissioner will interpret and apply the rules in this section as necessary and appropriate to prevent avoidance of the purposes of section 197. If one of the principal purposes of a transaction is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 197, the Commissioner will recast the transaction for Federal tax purposes as appropriate to achieve tax results that are consistent with the purposes of section 197, in light of the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and the pertinent facts and circumstances.
(k)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1. Advertising costs.
(i) Q manufactures and sells consumer products through a series of wholesalers and distributors. In order to increase sales of its products by encouraging consumer loyalty to its products and to enhance the value of the goodwill, trademarks, and trade names of the business, Q advertises its products to the consuming public. It regularly incurs costs to develop radio, television, and print advertisements. These costs generally consist of employee costs and amounts paid to independent advertising agencies. Q also incurs costs to run these advertisements in the various media for which they were developed.
(ii) The advertising costs are not chargeable to capital account under paragraph (f)(3) of this section (relating to costs incurred for covenants not to compete, rights granted by governmental units, and contracts for the use of section 197 intangibles) and are currently deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162. Accordingly, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, section 197 does not apply to these costs.

# Example 2. Computer software.
(i) X purchases all of the assets of an existing trade or business from Y. One of the assets acquired is all of Y's rights in certain computer software previously used by Y under the terms of a nonexclusive license from the software developer. The software was developed for use by manufacturers to maintain a comprehensive accounting system, including general and subsidiary ledgers, payroll, accounts receivable and payable, cash receipts and disbursements, fixed asset accounting, and inventory cost accounting and controls. The developer modified the software for use by Y at a cost of $1,000 and Y made additional modifications at a cost of $500. The developer does not maintain wholesale or retail outlets but markets the software directly to ultimate users. Y's license of the software is limited to an entity that is actively engaged in business as a manufacturer.
(ii) Notwithstanding these limitations, the software is considered to be readily available to the general public for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. In addition, the software is not substantially modified because the cost of the modifications by the developer and Y to the version of the software that is readily available to the general
public does not exceed $2,000. Accordingly, the software is not a section 197 intangible.

# Example 3. Acquisition of software for internal use.
(i) B, the owner and operator of a worldwide package-delivery service, purchases from S all rights to software developed by S. The software will be used by B for the sole purpose of improving its package-tracking operations. B does not purchase any other assets in the transaction or any related transaction.
(ii) Because B acquired the software solely for internal use, it is disregarded in determining for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section whether the assets acquired in the transaction or series of related transactions constitute a trade or business or substantial portion thereof. Since no other assets were acquired, the software is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business and under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section is not a section 197 intangible.

# Example 4. Governmental rights of fixed duration.
(i) City M operates a municipal water system. In order to induce X to locate a new manufacturing business in the city, M grants X the right to purchase water for 16 years at a specified price.
(ii) The right granted by M is a right to receive tangible property or services described in section 197(e)(4)(B) and paragraph (c)(6) of this section and, thus, is not a section 197 intangible. This exclusion applies even though the right does not qualify for exclusion as a right of fixed duration or amount under section 197(e)(4)(D) and paragraph (c)(13) of this section because the duration exceeds 15 years and the right is not fixed as to amount. It is also immaterial that the right would not qualify for exclusion as a self-created intangible under section 197(c)(2) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section because it is granted by a governmental unit.

# Example 5. Separate acquisition of franchise.
(i) S is a franchiser of retail outlets for specialty coffees. G enters into a franchise agreement (within the meaning of section 1253(b)(1)) with S pursuant to which G is permitted to acquire and operate a store using the S trademark and trade name at the location specified in the agreement. G agrees to pay S $100,000 upon execution of the agreement and also agrees to pay, throughout the term of the franchise, additional amounts that are deductible under section 1253(d)(1). The agreement contains detailed specifications for the construction and operation of the business, but G is not required to purchase from S any of the materials necessary to construct the improvements at the location specified in the franchise agreement.
(ii) The franchise is a section 197 intangible within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section. The franchise does not qualify for the exclusion relating to self-created intangibles described in section 197(c)(2) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section because the franchise is described in section 197(d)(1)(F). In addition, because the acquisition of the franchise constitutes the acquisition of an interest in a trade or business or a substantial portion thereof, the franchise may not be excluded under section 197(e)(4). Thus, the franchise is an amortizable section 197 intangible, the basis of which must be recovered over a 15-year period. However, the amounts that are deductible under section 1253(d)(1) are not subject to the provisions of section 197 by reason of section 197(f)(4)(C) and paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section.

# Example 6. Acquisition and amortization of covenant not to compete.
(i) As part of the acquisition of a trade or business from C, B and C enter into an agreement containing a covenant not to compete. Under this agreement, C agrees that it will not compete with the business acquired by B within a prescribed geographical territory for a period of three years after the date on which the business is sold to B. In exchange for this agreement, B agrees to pay C $90,000 per year for each year in the term of the agreement. The agreement further provides that, in the event of a breach by C of his obligations under the agreement, B may terminate the agreement, cease making any of the payments due thereafter, and pursue any other legal or equitable remedies available under applicable law. The amounts payable to C under the agreement are not contingent payments for purposes of § 1.1275-4. The present fair market value of B's rights under the agreement is $225,000. The aggregate consideration paid excluding any amount treated as interest or original issue discount under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, for all assets acquired in the transaction (including the covenant not to compete) exceeds the sum of the amount of Class I assets and the aggregate fair market value of all Class II, Class III, Class IV, Class V, and Class VI assets by $50,000. See § 1.338-6(b) for rules for determining the assets in each class.
(ii) Because the covenant is acquired in an applicable asset acquisition (within the meaning of section 1060(c)), paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section applies and the basis of B in the covenant is determined pursuant to section 1060(a) and the regulations thereunder. Under §§ 1.1060-1(c)(2) and 1.338-6(c)(1), B's basis in the covenant cannot exceed its fair market value. Thus, B's basis in the covenant immediately after the acquisition is $225,000. This basis is amortized ratably over the 15-year period beginning on the first day of the month in which the agreement is entered into. All of the remaining consideration after allocation to the convenant and other Class VI assets ($50,000) is allocated to Class VII assets (goodwill and going concern value). See §§ 1.1060-1(c)(2) and 1.338-6(b).

# Example 7. Stand-alone license of technology.
(i) X is a manufacturer of consumer goods that does business throughout the world
through subsidiary corporations organized under the laws of each country in which business is conducted. X licenses to Y, its subsidiary organized and conducting business in Country K, all of the patents, formulas, designs, and know-how necessary for Y to manufacture the same products that X manufactures in the United States. Assume that the license is not considered a sale or exchange under the principles of section 1235. The license is for a term of 18 years, and there are no facts to indicate that the license does not have a fixed duration. Y agrees to pay X a royalty equal to a specified, fixed percentage of the revenues obtained from selling products manufactured using the licensed technology. Assume that the royalty is reasonable and is not subject to adjustment under section 482. The license is not entered into in connection with any other transaction. Y incurs capitalized costs in connection with entering into the license.
(ii) The license is a contract for the use of a section 197 intangible within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section. It does not qualify for the exception in section 197(e)(4)(D) and paragraph (c)(13) of this section (relating to rights of fixed duration or amount because it does not have a term of less than 15 years, and the other exceptions in section 197(e) and paragraph (c) of this section are also inapplicable. Accordingly, the license is a section 197 intangible.
(iii) The license is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business. Thus, under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, the license will be closely scrutinized under the principles of section 1235 for purposes of determining whether the transfer is a sale or exchange and, accordingly, whether the payments under the license are chargeable to capital account. Because the license is not a sale or exchange under the principles of section 1235, the royalty payments are not chargeable to capital account for purposes section 197. The capitalized costs of entering into the license are not within the exception under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for self-created intangibles, and thus are amortized under section 197.

# Example 8. License of technology and trademarks.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that the license also includes the use of the trademarks and trade names that X uses to manufacture and distribute its products in the United States. Assume that under the principles of section 1253 the transfer is not a sale or exchange of the trademarks and trade names or an undivided interest therein and that the royalty payments are described in section 1253(d)(1)(B).
(ii) As in
Example 7,
the license is a section 197 intangible. Although the license conveys an interest in X's trademarks and trade names to Y, the transfer of the interest is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (e)(2) of this section unless the transfer is considered a sale or exchange of the trademarks and trade names or an undivided interest therein. Accordingly, the licensing of the technology and the trademarks and trade names is not treated as part of a purchase of a trade or business under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(iii) Because the technology license is not part of the purchase of a trade or business, it is treated in the manner described in
Example 7.
The royalty payments for the use of the trademarks and trade names are deductible under section 1253(d)(1) and, under section 197(f)(4)(C) and paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section, are not chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 197. The capitalized costs of entering into the license are treated in the same manner as in example 7.

# Example 9. Disguised sale.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that Y agrees to pay X, in addition to the contingent royalty, a fixed minimum royalty immediately upon entering into the agreement and there are sufficient facts present to characterize the transaction, for federal tax purposes, as a transfer of ownership of the intellectual property from X to Y.
(ii) The purported license of technology is, in fact, an acquisition of an intangible described in section 197(d)(1)(C)(iii) and paragraph (b)(5) of this section (relating to know-how, etc.). As in
Example 7,
the exceptions in section 197(e) and paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to the transfer. Accordingly, the transferred property is a section 197 intangible. Y's basis in the transferred intangible includes the capitalized costs of entering into the agreement and the fixed minimum royalty payment payable at the time of the transfer. In addition, except to the extent that a portion of any payment will be treated as interest or original issue discount under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, all of the contingent payments under the purported license are properly chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 197 and this section. The extent to which such payments are treated as payments of principal and the time at which any amount treated as a payment of principal is taken into account in determining basis are determined under the rules of § 1.1275-4(c)(4) or 1.483-4(a), whichever is applicable. Any contingent amount that is included in basis after the month in which the acquisition occurs is amortized under the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.

# Example 10. License of technology and customer list as part of sale of a trade or business.
(i) X is a computer manufacturer that produces, in separate operating divisions, personal computers, servers, and peripheral equipment. In a transaction that is the purchase of a trade or business for purposes of
section 197, Y (who is unrelated to X) purchases from X all assets of the operating division producing personal computers, except for certain patents that are also used in the division manufacturing servers and customer lists that are also used in the division manufacturing peripheral equipment. As part of the transaction, X transfers to Y the right to use the retained patents and customer lists solely in connection with the manufacture and sale of personal computers. The transfer agreement requires annual royalty payments contingent on the use of the patents and also requires a payment for each use of the customer list. In addition, Y incurs capitalized costs in connection with entering into the licenses.
(ii) The rights to use the retained patents and customer lists are contracts for the use of section 197 intangibles within the meaning of paragraph (b)(11) of this section. The rights do not qualify for the exception in 197(e)(4)(D) and paragraph (c)(13) of this section (relating to rights of fixed duration or amount) because they are transferred as part of a purchase of a trade or business and the other exceptions in section 197(e) and paragraph (c) of this section are also inapplicable. Accordingly, the licenses are section 197 intangibles.
(iii) Because the right to use the retained patents is described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section and the right is transferred as part of a purchase of a trade or business, the treatment of the royalty payments is determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, however, the retained patents are described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Thus, the annual royalty payments are chargeable to capital account under the general rule of paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section unless Y establishes that the license is not a sale or exchange under the principles of section 1235 and the royalty payments are an arm's length consideration for the rights transferred. If these facts are established, the exception in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section applies and the royalty payments are not chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 197. The capitalized costs of entering into the license are treated in the same manner as in Example 7.
(iv) The right to use the retained customer list is also described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section and is transferred as part of a purchase of a trade or business. Thus, the treatment of the payments for use of the customer list is also determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. The customer list, although described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, is a customer-related information base. Thus, the exception in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, payments for use of the list are chargeable to capital account under the general rule of paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and are amortized under section 197. In addition, the capitalized costs of entering into the contract for use of the customer list are treated in the same manner as in
Example 7.

# Example 11. Loss disallowance rules involving related persons.
(i) Assume that X and Y are treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. In a single transaction, X and Y acquired from Z all of the assets used by Z in a trade or business. Z had operated this business at two locations, and X and Y each acquired the assets used by Z at one of the locations. Three years after the acquisition, X sold all of the assets it acquired, including amortizable section 197 intangibles, to an unrelated purchaser. The amortizable section intangibles are sold at a loss of $120,000.
(ii) Because X and Y are treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the loss disallowance rules of section 197(f)(1) and paragraph (g)(1) of this section, X's loss on the sale of the amortizable section 197 intangibles is not recognized. Under paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, X's disallowed loss is allowed ratably, as a deduction under section 197, over the remainder of the 15-year period during which the intangibles would have been amortized, and Y may not increase the basis of the amortizable section 197 intangibles that it acquired from Z by the amount of X's disallowed loss.

# Example 12. Disposition of retained intangibles by related person.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 11,
except that 10 years after the acquisition of the assets by X and Y and 7 years after the sale of the assets by X, Y sells all of the assets acquired from Z, including amortizable section 197 intangibles, to an unrelated purchaser.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, X may recognize, on the date of the sale by Y, any loss that has not been allowed as a deduction under section 197. Accordingly, X recognizes a loss of $50,000, the amount obtained by reducing the loss on the sale of the assets at the end of the third year ($120,000) by the amount allowed as a deduction under paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section during the 7 years following the sale by X ($70,000).

# Example 13. Acquisition of an interest in partnership with no section 754 election.
(i) A, B, and C each contribute $1,500 for equal shares in general partnership P. On January 1, 1998, P acquires as its sole asset an amortizable section 197 intangible for $4,500. P still holds the intangible on January 1, 2003, at which time the intangible has an adjusted basis to P of $3,000, and A, B, and C each have an adjusted basis of $1,000 in their partnership interests. D (who is not related to A) acquires A's interest in P for $1,600. No section 754 election is in effect for 2003.
(ii) Because there is no change in the basis of the intangible under section 743(b), D merely steps into the shoes of A with respect
to the intangible. D's proportionate share of P's adjusted basis in the intangible is $1,000, which continues to be amortized over the 10 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period for the intangible.

# Example 14. Acquisition of an interest in partnership with a section 754 election.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 13,
except that a section 754 election is in effect for 2003.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, for purposes of section 197, D is treated as if P owns two assets. D's proportionate share of P's adjusted basis in one asset is $1,000, which continues to be amortized over the 10 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period. For the other asset, D's proportionate share of P's adjusted basis is $600 (the amount of the basis increase under section 743 as a result of the section 754 election), which is amortized over a new 15-year period beginning January 2003. With respect to B and C, P's remaining $2,000 adjusted basis in the intangible continues to be amortized over the 10 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period.

# Example 15. Payment to a retiring partner by partnership with a section 754 election.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 13,
except that a section 754 election is in effect for 2003 and, instead of D acquiring A's interest in P, A retires from P. A, B, and C are not related to each other within the meaning of paragraph (h)(6) of this section. P borrows $1,600, and A receives a payment under section 736 from P of such amount, all of which is in exchange for A's interest in the intangible asset owned by P. (Assume, for purposes of this example, that the borrowing by P and payment of such funds to A does not give rise to a disguised sale of A's partnership interest under section 707(a)(2)(B).) P makes a positive basis adjustment of $600 with respect to the section 197 intangible under section 734(b).
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, because of the section 734 adjustment, P is treated as having two amortizable section 197 intangibles, one with a basis of $3,000 and a remaining amortization period of 10 years and the other with a basis of $600 and a new amortization period of 15 years.

# Example 16. Termination of partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B).
(i) A and B are partners with equal shares in the capital and profits of general partnership P. P's only asset is an amortizable section 197 intangible, which P had acquired on January 1, 1995. On January 1, 2000, the asset had a fair market value of $100 and a basis to P of $50. On that date, A sells his entire partnership interest in P to C, who is unrelated to A, for $50. At the time of the sale, the basis of each of A and B in their respective partnership interests is $25.
(ii) The sale causes a termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B). Under section 708, the transaction is treated as if P transfers its sole asset to a new partnership in exchange for the assumption of its liabilities and the receipt of all of the interests in the new partnership. Immediately thereafter, P is treated as if it is liquidated, with B and C each receiving their proportionate share of the interests in the new partnership. The contribution by P of its asset to the new partnership is governed by section 721, and the liquidating distributions by P of the interests in the new partnership are governed by section 731. C does not realize a basis adjustment under section 743 with respect to the amortizable section 197 intangible unless P had a section 754 election in effect for its taxable year in which the transfer of the partnership interest to C occurred or the taxable year in which the deemed liquidation of P occurred.
(iii) Under section 197, if P had a section 754 election in effect, C is treated as if the new partnership had acquired two assets from P immediately preceding its termination. Even though the adjusted basis of the new partnership in the two assets is determined solely under section 723, because the transfer of assets is a transaction described in section 721, the application of sections 743(b) and 754 to P immediately before its termination causes P to be treated as if it held two assets for purposes of section 197. See paragraph (g)(3) of this section. B's and C's proportionate share of the new partnership's adjusted basis is $25 each in one asset, which continues to be amortized over the 10 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period. For the other asset, C's proportionate share of the new partnership's adjusted basis is $25 (the amount of the basis increase resulting from the application of section 743 to the sale or exchange by A of the interest in P), which is amortized over a new 15-year period beginning in January 2000.
(iv) If P did not have a section 754 election in effect for its taxable year in which the sale of the partnership interest by A to C occurred or the taxable year in which the deemed liquidation of P occurred, the adjusted basis of the new partnership in the amortizable section 197 intangible is determined solely under section 723, because the transfer is a transaction described in section 721, and P does not have a basis increase in the intangible. Under section 197(f)(2) and paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the new partnership continues to amortize the intangible over the 10 years remaining in the original 15-year amortization period. No additional amortization is allowable with respect to this asset.

# Example 17. Disguised sale to partnership.
(i) E and F are individuals who are unrelated to each other within the meaning of paragraph (h)(6) of this section. E has been engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business as a sole proprietor since 1990. E and F form EF
Partnership. E transfers all of the assets of the business, having a fair market value of $100, to EF, and F transfers $40 of cash to EF. E receives a 60 percent interest in EF and the $40 of cash contributed by F, and F receives a 40 percent interest in EF, under circumstances in which the transfer by E is partially treated as a sale of property to EF under § 1.707-3(b).
(ii) Under § 1.707-3(a)(1), the transaction is treated as if E had sold to EF a 40 percent interest in each asset for $40 and contributed the remaining 60 percent interest in each asset to EF in exchange solely for an interest in EF. Because E and EF are related persons within the meaning of paragraph (h)(6) of this section, no portion of any transferred section 197(f)(9) intangible that E held during the transition period (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) is an amortizable section 197 intangible pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Section 197(f)(9)(F) and paragraph (g)(3) of this section do not apply to any portion of the section 197 intangible in the hands of EF because the basis of EF in these assets was not increased under any of sections 732, 734, or 743.

# Example 18. Acquisition by related person in nonrecognition transaction.
(i) A owns a nonamortizable intangible that A acquired in 1990. In 2000, A sells a one-half interest in the intangible to B for cash. Immediately after the sale, A and B, who are unrelated to each other, form partnership P as equal partners. A and B each contribute their one-half interest in the intangible to P.
(ii) P has a transferred basis in the intangible from A and B under section 723. The nonrecognition transfer rule under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section applies to A's transfer of its one-half interest in the intangible to P, and consequently P steps into A's shoes with respect to A's nonamortizable transferred basis. The anti-churning rules of paragraph (h) of this section apply to B's transfer of its one-half interest in the intangible to P, because A, who is related to P under paragraph (h)(6) of this section immediately after the series of transactions in which the intangible was acquired by P, held B's one-half interest in the intangible during the transition period. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(10) of this section, these rules apply to B's transfer of its one-half interest to P even though the nonrecognition transfer rule under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section would have permitted P to step into B's shoes with respect to B's otherwise amortizable basis. Therefore, P's entire basis in the intangible is nonamortizable. However, if A (not B) elects to recognize gain under paragraph (h)(9) of this section on the transfer of each of the one-half interests in the intangible to B and P, then the intangible would be amortizable by P to the extent provided in section 197(f)(9)(B) and paragraph (h)(9) of this section.

# Example 19. Acquisition of partnership interest following formation of partnership.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 18
except that, in 2000, A formed P with an affiliate, S, and contributed the intangible to the partnership and except that in a subsequent year, in a transaction that is properly characterized as a sale of a partnership interest for Federal tax purposes, B purchases a 50 percent interest in P from A. P has a section 754 election in effect and holds no assets other than the intangible and cash.
(ii) For the reasons set forth in
Example 16
(iii), B is treated as if P owns two assets. B's proportionate share of P's adjusted basis in one asset is the same as A's proportionate share of P's adjusted basis in that asset, which is not amortizable under section 197. For the other asset, B's proportionate share of the remaining adjusted basis of P is amortized over a new 15-year period.

# Example 20. Acquisition by related corporation in nonrecognition transaction.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 18,
except that A and B form corporation P as equal owners.
(ii) P has a transferred basis in the intangible from A and B under section 362. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(10) of this section, the application of the nonrecognition transfer rule under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section and the anti-churning rules of paragraph (h) of this section to the facts of this
Example 18
is the same as in
Example 16.
Thus, P's entire basis in the intangible is nonamortizable.

# Example 21. Acquisition from corporation related to purchaser through remote indirect interest.
(i) X, Y, and Z are each corporations that have only one class of issued and outstanding stock. X owns 25 percent of the stock of Y and Y owns 25 percent of the outstanding stock of Z. No other shareholder of any of these corporations is related to any other shareholder or to any of the corporations. On June 30, 2000, X purchases from Z section 197(f)(9) intangibles that Z owned during the transition period (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section).
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (h)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, the beneficial ownership interest of X in Z is 6.25 percent, determined by treating X as if it owned a proportionate (25 percent) interest in the stock of Z that is actually owned by Y. Thus, even though X is related to Y and Y is related to Z, X and Z are not considered to be related for purposes of the anti-churning rules of section 197.

# Example 22. Gain recognition election.
(i) B owns 25 percent of the stock of S, a corporation that uses the calendar year as its taxable year. No other shareholder of B or S is related to each other. S is not a member of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning of section 1563(a). S has section 197(f)(9) intangibles that it owned during the transition period. S has a basis of $25,000 in the intangibles. In 2001, S sells these intangibles to B for $75,000. S recognizes a gain of
$50,000 on the sale and has no other items of income, deduction, gain, or loss for the year, except that S also has a net operating loss of $20,000 from prior years that it would otherwise be entitled to use in 2001 pursuant to section 172(b). S makes a valid gain recognition election pursuant to section 197(f)(9)(B) and paragraph (h)(9) of this section. In 2001, the highest marginal tax rate applicable to S is 35 percent. But for the election, all of S's taxable income would be taxed at a rate of 15 percent.
(ii) If the gain recognition election had not been made, S would have taxable income of $30,000 for 2001 and a tax liability of $4,500. If the gain were not taken into account, S would have no tax liability for the taxable year. Thus, the amount of tax (other than the tax imposed under paragraph (h)(9) of this section) imposed on the gain is also $4,500. The gain on the disposition multiplied by the highest marginal tax rate is $17,500 ($50,000 × .35). Accordingly, S's tax liability for the year is $4,500 plus an additional tax under paragraph (h)(9) of this section of $13,000 ($17,500—$4,500).
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (h)(9)(x)(A) of this section, S determines the amount of its net operating loss deduction in subsequent years without regard to the gain recognized on the sale of the section 197 intangible to B. Accordingly, the entire $20,000 net operating loss deduction that would have been available in 2001 but for the gain recognition election may be used in 2002, subject to the limitations of section 172.
(iv) B has a basis of $75,000 in the section 197(f)(9) intangibles acquired from S. As the result of the gain recognition election by S, B may amortize $50,000 of its basis under section 197. Under paragraph (h)(9)(ii) of this section, the remaining basis does not qualify for the gain-recognition exception and may not be amortized by B.

# Example 23. Section 338 election.
(i) Corporation P makes a qualified stock purchase of the stock of T corporation from two shareholders in July 2000, and a section 338 election is made by P. No shareholder of either T or P owns stock in both of these corporations, and no other shareholder is related to any other shareholder of either corporation.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (h)(8) of this section, in the case of a qualified stock purchase that is treated as a deemed sale and purchase of assets pursuant to section 338, the corporation treated as purchasing assets as a result of an election thereunder (new target) is not considered the person that held or used the assets during any period in which the assets were held or used by the corporation treated as selling the assets (old target). Because there are no relationships described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section among the parties to the transaction, any nonamortizable section 197(f)(9) intangible held by old target is an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of new target.
(iii) Assume the same facts as set forth in paragraph (i) of this
Example 23,
except that one of the selling shareholders is an individual who owns 25 percent of the total value of the stock of each of the T and P corporation.
(iv) Old target and new target (as these terms are defined in § 1.338-2(c)(17)) are members of a controlled group of corporations under section 267(b)(3), as modified by section 197(f)(9)(C)(i), and any nonamortizable section 197(f)(9) intangible held by old target is not an amortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of new target. However, a gain recognition election under paragraph (h)(9) of this section may be made with respect to this transaction.

# Example 24. Relationship created as part of public offering.
(i) On January 1, 2001, Corporation X engages in a series of related transactions to discontinue its involvement in one line of business. X forms a new corporation, Y, with a nominal amount of cash. Shortly thereafter, X transfers all the stock of its subsidiary conducting the unwanted business (Target) to Y in exchange for 100 shares of Y common stock and a Y promissory note. Target owns a nonamortizable section 197(f)(9) intangible. Prior to January 1, 2001, X and an underwriter (U) had entered into a binding agreement pursuant to which U would purchase 85 shares of Y common stock from X and then sell those shares in a public offering. On January 6, 2001, the public offering closes. X and Y make a section 338(h)(10) election for Target.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (h)(8) of this section, in the case of a qualified stock purchase that is treated as a deemed sale and purchase of assets pursuant to section 338, the corporation treated as purchasing assets as a result of an election thereunder (new target) is not considered the person that held or used the assets during any period in which the assets were held or used by the corporation treated as selling the assets (old target). Further, for purposes of determining whether the nonamortizable section 197(f)(9) intangible is acquired by new target from a related person, because the transactions are a series of related transactions, the relationship between old target and new target must be tested immediately before the first transaction in the series (the formation of Y) and immediately after the last transaction in the series (the sale to U and the public offering). See paragraph (h)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. Because there was no relationship between old target and new target immediately before the formation of Y (because the section 338 election had not been made) and only a 15% relationship between old target and new target immediately after, old target is not related to new target for purposes of applying the anti-churning rules of paragraph (h)
of this section. Accordingly, Target may amortize the section 197 intangible.

# Example 25. Other transfers to controlled corporations.
(i) In 2001, Corporation A transfers a section 197(f)(9) intangible that it held during the transition period to X, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 15% of X's stock. As part of the same transaction, B transfers property to X in exchange for the remaining 85% of X stock.
(ii) Because the acquisition of the intangible by X is part of a qualifying section 351 exchange, under section 197(f)(2) and paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, X is treated in the same manner as the transferor of the asset. Accordingly, X may not amortize the intangible. If, however, at the time of the exchange, B has a binding commitment to sell 25 percent of the X stock to C, an unrelated third party, the exchange, including A's transfer of the section 197(f)(9) intangible, would fail to qualify as a section 351 exchange. Because the formation of X, the transfers of property to X, and the sale of X stock by B are part of a series of related transactions, the relationship between A and X must be tested immediately before the first transaction in the series (the transfer of property to X) and immediately after the last transaction in the series (the sale of X stock to C). See paragraph (h)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. Because there was no relationship between A and X immediately before and only a 15% relationship immediately after, A is not related to X for purposes of applying the anti-churning rules of paragraph (h) of this section. Accordingly, X may amortize the section 197 intangible.

# Example 26. Relationship created as part of stock acquisition followed by liquidation.
(i) In 2001, Partnership P purchases 100 percent of the stock of Corporation X. P and X were not related prior to the acquisition. Immediately after acquiring the X stock, and as part of a series of related transactions, P liquidates X under section 331. In the liquidating distribution, P receives a section 197(f)(9) intangible that was held by X during the transition period.
(ii) Because the relationship between P and X was created pursuant to a series of related transactions where P acquires stock (meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)) in a fully taxable transaction followed by a liquidation under section 331, the relationship immediately after the last transaction in the series (the liquidation) is disregarded. See paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, P is entitled to amortize the section 197(f)(9) intangible.

# Example 27. Section 743(b) adjustment with no change in user.
(i) On January 1, 2001, A forms a partnership (PRS) with B in which A owns a 40-percent, and B owns a 60-percent, interest in profits and capital. A contributes a nonamortizable section 197(f)(9) intangible with a value of $80 and an adjusted basis of $0 to PRS in exchange for its PRS interest and B contributes $120 cash. At the time of the contribution, PRS licenses the section 197(f)(9) intangible to A. On February 1, 2001, A sells its entire interest in PRS to C, an unrelated person, for $80. PRS has a section 754 election in effect.
(ii) The section 197(f)(9) intangible contributed to PRS by A is not amortizable in the hands of PRS. Pursuant to section (g)(2)(ii) of this section, PRS steps into the shoes of A with respect to A's nonamortizable transferred basis in the intangible.
(iii) When A sells the PRS interest to C, C will have a basis adjustment in the PRS assets under section 743(b) equal to $80. The entire basis adjustment will be allocated to the intangible because the only other asset held by PRS is cash. Ordinarily, under paragraph (h)(12)(v) of this section, the anti-churning rules will not apply to an increase in the basis of partnership property under section 743(b) if the person acquiring the partnership interest is not related to the person transferring the partnership interest. However, A is an anti-churning partner under paragraph (h)(12)(vi)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section. As a result of the license agreement, A remains a direct user of the section 197(f)(9) intangible after the transfer to C. Accordingly, paragraph (h)(12)(vi)(A) of this section will cause the anti-churning rules to apply to the entire basis adjustment under section 743(b).

# Example 28. Distribution of section 197(f)(9) intangible to partner who acquired partnership interest prior to the effective date.
(i) In 1990, A, B, and C each contribute $150 cash to form general partnership ABC for the purpose of engaging in a consulting business and a software manufacturing business. The partners agree to share partnership profits and losses equally. In 2000, the partnership distributes the consulting business to A in liquidation of A's entire interest in ABC. The only asset of the consulting business is a nonamortizable intangible, which has a fair market value of $180 and a basis of $0. At the time of the distribution, the adjusted basis of A's interest in ABC is $150. A is not related to B or C. ABC does not have a section 754 election in effect.
(ii) Under section 732(b), A's adjusted basis in the intangible distributed by ABC is $150, a $150 increase over the basis of the intangible in ABC's hands. In determining whether the anti-churning rules apply to any portion of the basis increase, A is treated as having owned and used A's proportionate share of partnership property. Thus, A is treated as holding an interest in the intangible during the transition period. Because the intangible was not amortizable prior to the enactment of section 197, the section 732(b) increase in the basis of the intangible may be subject to the anti-churning provisions. Paragraph (h)(12)(ii) of this section provides that the anti-churning provisions
apply to the extent that the section 732(b) adjustment exceeds the total unrealized appreciation from the intangible allocable to partners other than A or persons related to A, as well as certain other partners whose purchase of their interests meet certain criteria. Because B and C are not related to A, and A's acquisition of its partnership interest does not satisfy the necessary criteria, the section 732(b) basis increase is subject to the anti-churning provisions to the extent that it exceeds B and C's proportionate share of the unrealized appreciation from the intangible. B and C's proportionate share of the unrealized appreciation from the intangible is $120 (2/3 of $180). This is the amount of gain that would be allocated to B and C if the partnership sold the intangible immediately before the distribution for its fair market value of $180. Therefore, $120 of the section 732(b) basis increase is not subject to the anti-churning rules. The remaining $30 of the section 732(b) basis increase is subject to the anti-churning rules. Accordingly, A is treated as having two intangibles, an amortizable section 197 intangible with an adjusted basis of $120 and a new amortization period of 15 years and a nonamortizable intangible with an adjusted basis of $30.
(iii) In applying the anti-churning rules to future transfers of the distributed intangible, under paragraph (h)(12)(ii)(C) of this section, one-third of the intangible will continue to be subject to the anti-churning rules, determined as follows: The sum of the amount of the distributed intangible's basis that is nonamortizable under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section ($0) and the total unrealized appreciation inherent in the intangible reduced by the amount of the increase in the adjusted basis of the distributed intangible under section 732(b) to which the anti-churning rules do not apply ($180−$120 = $60), over the fair market value of the distributed intangible ($180).

# Example 29. Distribution of section 197(f)(9) intangible to partner who acquired partnership interest after the effective date.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 28,
except that B and C form ABC in 1990. A does not acquire an interest in ABC until 1995. In 1995, A contributes $150 to ABC in exchange for a one-third interest in ABC. At the time of the distribution, the adjusted basis of A's interest in ABC is $150.
(ii) As in
Example 28,
the anti-churning rules do not apply to the increase in the basis of the intangible distributed to A under section 732(b) to the extent that it does not exceed the unrealized appreciation from the intangible allocable to B and C. Under paragraph (h)(12)(ii) of this section, the anti-churning provisions also do not apply to the section 732(b) basis increase to the extent of A's allocable share of the unrealized appreciation from the intangible because A acquired the ABC interest from an unrelated person after August 10, 1993, and the intangible was acquired by the partnership before A acquired the ABC interest. Under paragraph (h)(12)(ii)(E) of this section, A is deemed to acquire the ABC partnership interest from an unrelated person because A acquired the ABC partnership interest in exchange for a contribution to the partnership of property other than the distributed intangible and, at the time of the contribution, no partner in the partnership was related to A. Consequently, the increase in the basis of the intangible under section 732(b) is not subject to the anti-churning rules to the extent of the total unrealized appreciation from the intangible allocable to A, B, and C. The total unrealized appreciation from the intangible allocable to A, B, and C is $180 (the gain the partnership would have recognized if it had sold the intangible for its fair market value immediately before the distribution). Because this amount exceeds the section 732(b) basis increase of $150, the entire section 732(b) basis increase is amortizable.
(iii) In applying the anti-churning rules to future transfers of the distributed intangible, under paragraph (h)(12)(ii)(C) of this section, one-sixth of the intangible will continue to be subject to the anti-churning rules, determined as follows: The sum of the amount of the distributed intangible's basis that is nonamortizable under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section ($0) and the total unrealized appreciation inherent in the intangible reduced by the amount of the increase in the adjusted basis of the distributed intangible under section 732(b) to which the anti-churning rules do not apply ($180−$150 = $30), over the fair market value of the distributed intangible ($180).

# Example 30. Distribution of section 197(f)(9) intangible contributed to the partnership by a partner.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 29,
except that C purchased the intangible used in the consulting business in 1988 for $60 and contributed the intangible to ABC in 1990. At that time, the intangible had a fair market value of $150 and an adjusted tax basis of $60. When ABC distributes the intangible to A in 2000, the intangible has a fair market value of $180 and a basis of $60.
(ii) As in
Examples 28
and
29,
the adjusted basis of the intangible in A's hands is $150 under section 732(b). However, the increase in the adjusted basis of the intangible under section 732(b) is only $90 ($150 adjusted basis after the distribution compared to $60 basis before the distribution). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, A steps into the shoes of ABC with respect to the $60 of A's adjusted basis in the intangible that corresponds to ABC's basis in the intangible and this portion of the basis is nonamortizable. B and C are not related to A, A acquired the ABC interest from an unrelated
person after August 10, 1993, and the intangible was acquired by ABC before A acquired the ABC interest. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(12)(ii) of this section, the section 732(b) basis increase is amortizable to the extent of A, B, and C's allocable share of the unrealized appreciation from the intangible. The total unrealized appreciation from the intangible that is allocable to A, B, and C is $120. If ABC had sold the intangible immediately before the distribution to A for its fair market value of $180, it would have recognized gain of $120, which would have been allocated $10 to A, $10 to B, and $100 to C under section 704(c). Because A, B, and C's allocable share of the unrealized appreciation from the intangible exceeds the section 732(b) basis increase in the intangible, the entire $90 of basis increase is amortizable by A. Accordingly, after the distribution, A will be treated as having two intangibles, an amortizable section 197 intangible with an adjusted basis of $90 and a new amortization period of 15 years and a nonamortizable intangible with an adjusted basis of $60.
(iii) In applying the anti-churning rules to future transfers of the distributed intangible, under paragraph (h)(12)(ii)(C) of this section, one-half of the intangible will continue to be subject to the anti-churning rules, determined as follows: The sum of the amount of the distributed intangible's basis that is nonamortizable under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section ($60) and the total unrealized appreciation inherent in the intangible reduced by the amount of the increase in the adjusted basis of the distributed intangible under section 732(b) to which the anti-churning rules do not apply ($120−$90 = $30), over the fair market value of the distributed intangible ($180).

# Example 31. Partnership distribution causing section 734(b) basis adjustment to section 197(f)(9) intangible.
(i) On January 1, 2001, A, B, and C form a partnership (ABC) in which each partner shares equally in capital and income, gain, loss, and deductions. On that date, A contributes a section 197(f)(9) intangible with a zero basis and a value of $150, and B and C each contribute $150 cash. A and B are related, but neither A nor B is related to C. ABC does not adopt the remedial allocation method for making section 704(c) allocations of amortization expenses with respect to the intangible. On December 1, 2004, when the value of the intangible has increased to $600, ABC distributes $300 to B in complete redemption of B's interest in the partnership. ABC has an election under section 754 in effect for the taxable year that includes December 1, 2004. (Assume that, at the time of the distribution, the basis of A's partnership interest remains zero, and the basis of each of B's and C's partnership interest remains $150.)
(ii) Immediately prior to the distribution, the assets of the partnership are revalued pursuant to § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
), so that the section 197(f)(9) intangible is reflected on the books of the partnership at a value of $600. B recognizes $150 of gain under section 731(a)(1) upon the distribution of $300 in redemption of B's partnership interest. As a result, the adjusted basis of the intangible held by ABC increases by $150 under section 734(b). A does not satisfy any of the tests set forth under paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(B) and thus is not an eligible partner. C is not related to B and thus is an eligible partner under paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section. The capital accounts of A and C are equal immediately after the distribution, so, pursuant to paragraph (h)(12)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section, each partner's share of the basis increase is equal to $75. Because A is not an eligible partner, the anti-churning rules apply to A's share of the basis increase. The anti-churning rules do not apply to C's share of the basis increase.
(iii) For book purposes, ABC determines the amortization of the asset as follows: First, the intangible that is subject to adjustment under section 734(b) will be divided into three assets: the first, with a basis and value of $75 will be amortizable for both book and tax purposes; the second, with a basis and value of $75 will be amortizable for book, but not tax purposes; and a third asset with a basis of zero and a value of $450 will not be amortizable for book or tax purposes. Any subsequent revaluation of the intangible pursuant to § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
) will be made solely with respect to the third asset (which is not amortizable for book purposes). The book and tax attributes from the first asset (
i.e.,
book and tax amortization) will be specially allocated to C. The book and tax attributes from the second asset (
i.e.,
book amortization and non-amortizable tax basis) will be specially allocated to A. Upon disposition of the intangible, each partner's share of gain or loss will be determined first by allocating among the partners an amount realized equal to the book value of the intangible attributable to such partner, with any remaining amount realized being allocated in accordance with the partnership agreement. Each partner then will compare its share of the amount realized with its remaining basis in the intangible to arrive at the gain or loss to be allocated to such partner. This is a reasonable method for amortizing the intangible for book purposes, and the results in allocating the income, gain, loss, and deductions attributable to the intangible do not contravene the purposes of the anti-churning rules under section 197 or paragraph (h) of this section.

§ 1.199A-1
Operational rules.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
This section provides operational rules for calculating the section 199A(a) qualified business income deduction (section 199A deduction) under section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). This section refers to the rules in §§ 1.199A-2 through 1.199A-6. This paragraph (a) provides an overview of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of section 199A and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6. Paragraph (c) of this section provides computational rules and examples for individuals whose taxable income does not exceed the threshold amount. Paragraph (d) of this section provides computational rules and examples for individuals whose taxable income exceeds the threshold amount. Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules for purposes of section 199A and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6. This section and §§ 1.199A-2 through 1.199A-6 do not apply for purposes of calculating the deduction in section 199A(g) for specified agricultural and horticultural cooperatives.
(2)
Usage of term individual.
For purposes of applying the rules of §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6, a reference to an individual includes a reference to a trust (other than a grantor trust) or an estate to the extent that the section 199A deduction is determined by the trust or estate under the rules of § 1.199A-6.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 199A and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Aggregated trade or business
means two or more trades or businesses that have been aggregated pursuant to § 1.199A-4.
(2)
Applicable percentage
means, with respect to any taxable year, 100 percent reduced (not below zero) by the percentage equal to the ratio that the taxable income of the individual for the taxable year in excess of the threshold amount, bears to $50,000 (or $100,000 in the case of a joint return).
(3)
Net capital gain
means
net capital gain
as defined in section 1222(11) plus any
qualified dividend income
(as defined in section 1(h)(11)(B)) for the taxable year.
(4)
Phase-in range
means a range of taxable income between the threshold amount and the threshold amount plus $50,000 (or $100,000 in the case of a joint return).
(5)
Qualified business income (QBI)
means the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to any trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) as determined under the rules of § 1.199A-3(b).
(6)
QBI component
means the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(7)
Qualified PTP income
is defined in § 1.199A-3(c)(3).
(8)
Qualified REIT dividends
are defined in § 1.199A-3(c)(2).
(9)
Reduction amount
means, with respect to any taxable year, the excess amount multiplied by the ratio that the taxable income of the individual for the taxable year in excess of the threshold amount, bears to $50,000 (or $100,000 in the case of a joint return). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(9), the
excess amount
is the amount by which 20 percent of QBI exceeds the greater of 50 percent of W-2 wages or the sum of 25 percent of W-2 wages plus 2.5 percent of the UBIA of qualified property.
(10)
Relevant passthrough entity (RPE)
means a partnership (other than a PTP) or an S corporation that is owned, directly or indirectly, by at least one individual, estate, or trust. Other passthrough entities including common trust funds as described in § 1.6032-1T and religious or apostolic organizations described in section 501(d) are also treated as RPEs if the entity files a Form 1065,
U.S. Return of Partnership Income,
and is owned, directly or indirectly, by at least one individual, estate, or trust.A trust or estate is treated as an RPE to the extent it passes through QBI, W-2 wages,
UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income.
(11)
Specified service trade or business (SSTB)
means a specified service trade or business as defined in § 1.199A-5(b).
(12)
Threshold amount
means, for any taxable year beginning before 2019, $157,500 (or $315,000 in the case of a taxpayer filing a joint return). In the case of any taxable year beginning after 2018, the threshold amount is the dollar amount in the preceding sentence increased by an amount equal to such dollar amount, multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) of the Code for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2017” for “calendar year 2016” in section 1(f)(3)(A)(ii). The amount of any increase under the preceding sentence is rounded as provided in section 1(f)(7) of the Code.
(13)
Total QBI amount
means the net total QBI from all trades or businesses (including the individual's share of QBI from trades or business conducted by RPEs).
(14)
Trade or business
means a trade or business that is a trade or business under section 162 (a section 162 trade or business) other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. In addition, rental or licensing of tangible or intangible property (rental activity) that does not rise to the level of a section 162 trade or business is nevertheless treated as a trade or business for purposes of section 199A, if the property is rented or licensed to a trade or business conducted by the individual or an RPE which is commonly controlled under § 1.199A-4(b)(1)(i) (regardless of whether the rental activity and the trade or business are otherwise eligible to be aggregated under § 1.199A-4(b)(1)).
(15)
Unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property
(
UBIA of qualified property
) is defined in § 1.199A-2(c).
(16)
W-2 wages
means W-2 wages of a trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) properly allocable to QBI as determined under § 1.199A-2(b).
(c)
Computation of the section 199A deduction for individuals with taxable income not exceeding threshold amount
—(1)
In general.
The section 199A deduction is determined for individuals with taxable income for the taxable year that does not exceed the threshold amount by adding 20 percent of the total QBI amount (including the individual's share of QBI from an RPE and QBI attributable to an SSTB) and 20 percent of the combined amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income (including the individual's share of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income from RPEs and qualified PTP income attributable to an SSTB). That sum is then compared to 20 percent of the amount by which the individual's taxable income exceeds net capital gain. The lesser of these two amounts is the individual's section 199A deduction.
(2)
Carryover rules
—(i)
Negative total QBI amount.
If the total QBI amount is less than zero, the portion of the individual's section 199A deduction related to QBI is zero for the taxable year. The negative total QBI amount is treated as negative QBI from a separate trade or business in the succeeding taxable years of the individual for purposes of section 199A and this section. This carryover rule does not affect the deductibility of the loss for purposes of other provisions of the Code.
(ii)
Negative combined qualified REIT dividends/qualified PTP income.
If the combined amount of REIT dividends and qualified PTP income is less than zero, the portion of the individual's section 199A deduction related to qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income is zero for the taxable year. The negative combined amount must be carried forward and used to offset the combined amount of REIT dividends and qualified PTP income in the succeeding taxable years of the individual for purposes of section 199A and this section. This carryover rule does not affect the deductibility of the loss for purposes of other provisions of the Code.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c). For purposes of these examples, unless indicated otherwise, assume that all of the trades or businesses are trades or businesses as defined in paragraph (b)(14) of this section and all of the tax items are effectively connected to a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of section 864(c). Total taxable income does not include the section 199A deduction.
(i)
Example 1.
A, an unmarried individual, owns and operates a computer repair shop as a sole proprietorship. The business generates $100,000 in net taxable income from operations in 2018. A has no capital gains or losses. After allowable deductions not relating to the business, A's total taxable income for 2018 is $81,000. The business's QBI is $100,000, the net amount of its qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. A's section 199A deduction for 2018 is equal to $16,200, the lesser of 20% of A's QBI from the business ($100,000 × 20% = $20,000) and 20% of A's total taxable income for the taxable year ($81,000 × 20% = $16,200).
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, except that A also has $7,000 in net capital gain for 2018 and that, after allowable deductions not relating to the business, A's taxable income for 2018 is $74,000. A's taxable income minus net capital gain is $67,000 ($74,000−$7,000). A's section 199A deduction is equal to $13,400, the lesser of 20% of A's QBI from the business ($100,000 × 20% = $20,000) and 20% of A's total taxable income minus net capital gain for the taxable year ($67,000 × 20% = $13,400).
(iii)
Example 3.
B and C are married and file a joint individual income tax return. B earns $50,000 in wages as an employee of an unrelated company in 2018. C owns 100% of the shares of X, an S corporation that provides landscaping services. X generates $100,000 in net income from operations in 2018. X pays C $150,000 in wages in 2018. B and C have no capital gains or losses. After allowable deductions not related to X, B and C's total taxable income for 2018 is $270,000. B's and C's wages are not considered to be income from a trade or business for purposes of the section 199A deduction. Because X is an S corporation, its QBI is determined at the S corporation level. X's QBI is $100,000, the net amount of its qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. The wages paid by X to C are considered to be a qualified item of deduction for purposes of determining X's QBI. The section 199A deduction with respect to X's QBI is then determined by C, X's sole shareholder, and is claimed on the joint return filed by B and C. B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to $20,000, the lesser of 20% of C's QBI from the business ($100,000 × 20% = $20,000) and 20% of B and C's total taxable income for the taxable year ($270,000 × 20% = $54,000).
(iv)
Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section except that B also earns $1,000 in qualified REIT dividends and $500 in qualified PTP income in 2018, increasing taxable income to $271,500. B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to $20,300, the lesser of:
(A) 20% of C's QBI from the business ($100,000 × 20% = $20,000) plus 20% of B's combined qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income ($1,500 × 20% = $300); and
(B) 20% of B and C's total taxable for the taxable year ($271,500 × 20% = $54,300).
(d)
Computation of the section 199A deduction for individuals with taxable income above threshold amount
—(1)
In general.
The section 199A deduction is determined for individuals with taxable income for the taxable year that exceeds the threshold amount by adding the QBI component described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the qualified REIT dividends/qualified PTP income component described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section (including the individual's share of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income from RPEs). That sum is then compared to 20 percent of the amount by which the individual's taxable income exceeds net capital gain. The lesser of these two amounts is the individual's section 199A deduction.
(2)
QBI component.
An individual with taxable income for the taxable year that exceeds the threshold amount determines the QBI component using the
following computational rules, which are to be applied in the order they appear.
(i)
SSTB exclusion.
If the individual's taxable income is within the phase-in range, then only the applicable percentage of QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property for each SSTB is taken into account for all purposes of determining the individual's section 199A deduction, including the application of the netting and carryover rules described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. If the individual's taxable income exceeds the phase-in range, then none of the individual's share of QBI, W-2 wages, or UBIA of qualified property attributable to an SSTB may be taken into account for purposes of determining the individual's section 199A deduction.
(ii)
Aggregated trade or business.
If an individual chooses to aggregate trades or businesses under the rules of § 1.199A-4, the individual must combine the QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property of each trade or business within an aggregated trade or business prior to applying the netting and carryover rules described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Netting and carryover
—(A)
Netting.
If an individual's QBI from at least one trade or business (including an aggregated trade or business) is less than zero, the individual must offset the QBI attributable to each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) that produced net positive QBI with the QBI from each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) that produced net negative QBI in proportion to the relative amounts of net QBI in the trades or businesses (or aggregated trades or businesses) with positive QBI. The adjusted QBI is then used in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from the trades or businesses (including aggregated trades or businesses) that produced net negative QBI are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (d) and are not carried over to the subsequent year.
(B)
Carryover of negative total QBI amount.
If an individual's QBI from all trades or businesses (including aggregated trades or businesses) combined is less than zero, the QBI component is zero for the taxable year. This negative amount is treated as negative QBI from a separate trade or business in the succeeding taxable years of the individual for purposes of section 199A and this section. This carryover rule does not affect the deductibility of the loss for purposes of other provisions of the Code. The W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from the trades or businesses (including aggregated trades or businesses) that produced net negative QBI are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (d) and are not carried over to the subsequent year.
(iv)
QBI component calculation
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the QBI component is the sum of the amounts determined under this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business). For each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) (including trades or businesses operated through RPEs) the individual must determine the lesser of—
(
1
) 20 percent of the QBI for that trade or business (or aggregated trade or business); or
(
2
) The greater of—
(
i
) 50 percent of W-2 wages with respect to that trade or business (or aggregated trade or business); or
(
ii
) The sum of 25 percent of W-2 wages with respect to that trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) plus 2.5 percent of the UBIA of qualified property with respect to that trade or business (or aggregated trade or business).
(B)
Taxpayers with taxable income within phase-in range.
If the individual's taxable income is within the phase-in range and the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section for a trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) is less than the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section for that trade or business (or aggregated trade or business), the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section for such trade or business (or aggregated trade
or business) is modified. Instead of the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section, the QBI component for the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) is the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section reduced by the reduction amount as defined in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. This reduction amount does not apply if the amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section is greater than the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section (in which circumstance the QBI component for the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) will be the unreduced amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section).
(3)
Qualified REIT dividends/qualified PTP income component
—(i)
In general.
The qualified REIT dividend/qualified PTP income component is 20 percent of the combined amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income received by the individual (including the individual's share of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income from RPEs).
(ii)
SSTB exclusion.
If the individual's taxable income is within the phase-in range, then only the applicable percentage of qualified PTP income generated by an SSTB is taken into account for purposes of determining the individual's section 199A deduction, including the determination of the combined amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the individual's taxable income exceeds the phase-in range, then none of the individual's share of qualified PTP income generated by an SSTB may be taken into account for purposes of determining the individual's section 199A deduction.
(iii)
Negative combined qualified REIT dividends/qualified PTP income.
If the combined amount of REIT dividends and qualified PTP income is less than zero, the portion of the individual's section 199A deduction related to qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income is zero for the taxable year. The negative combined amount must be carried forward and used to offset the combined amount of REIT dividends/qualified PTP income in the succeeding taxable years of the individual for purposes of section 199A and this section. This carryover rule does not affect the deductibility of the loss for purposes of other provisions of the Code.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d). For purposes of these examples, unless indicated otherwise, assume that all of the trades or businesses are trades or businesses as defined in paragraph (b)(14) of this section, none of the trades or businesses are SSTBs as defined in paragraph (b)(11) of this section and § 1.199A-5(b); and all of the tax items associated with the trades or businesses are effectively connected to a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of section 864(c). Also assume that the taxpayers report no capital gains or losses or other tax items not specified in the examples. Total taxable income does not include the section 199A deduction.
(i)
Example 1.
D, an unmarried individual, operates a business as a sole proprietorship. The business generates $1,000,000 of QBI in 2018. Solely for purposes of this example, assume that the business paid no wages and holds no qualified property for use in the business. After allowable deductions unrelated to the business, D's total taxable income for 2018 is $980,000. Because D's taxable income exceeds the applicable threshold amount, D's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. D's section 199A deduction is limited to zero because the business paid no wages and held no qualified property.
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that D holds qualified property with a UBIA of $10,000,000 for use in the trade or business. D reports $4,000,000 of QBI for 2020. After allowable deductions unrelated to the business, D's total taxable income for 2020 is $3,980,000. Because D's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of D's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Because the business has no W-2 wages, the QBI component of D's section 199A deduction is limited to the
lesser of 20% of the business's QBI or 2.5% of its UBIA of qualified property. Twenty percent of the $4,000,000 of QBI is $800,000. Two and one-half percent of the $10,000,000 UBIA of qualified property is $250,000. The QBI component of D's section 199A deduction is thus limited to $250,000. D's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of:
(A) 20% of the QBI from the business as limited ($250,000); or
(B) 20% of D's taxable income ($3,980,000 × 20% = $796,000). Therefore, D's section 199A deduction for 2020 is $250,000.
(iii)
Example 3.
E, an unmarried individual, is a 30% owner of LLC, which is classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. In 2018, the LLC has a single trade or business and reports QBI of $3,000,000. The LLC pays total W-2 wages of $1,000,000, and its total UBIA of qualified property is $100,000. E is allocated 30% of all items of the partnership. For the 2018 taxable year, E reports $900,000 of QBI from the LLC. After allowable deductions unrelated to LLC, E's taxable income is $880,000. Because E's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of E's section 199A deduction will be limited to the lesser of 20% of E's share of LLC's QBI or the greater of the W-2 wage or UBIA of qualified property limitations. Twenty percent of E's share of QBI of $900,000 is $180,000. The W-2 wage limitation equals 50% of E's share of the LLC's wages ($300,000) or $150,000. The UBIA of qualified property limitation equals $75,750, the sum of 25% of E's share of LLC's wages ($300,000) or $75,000 plus 2.5% of E's share of UBIA of qualified property ($30,000) or $750. The greater of the limitation amounts ($150,000 and $75,750) is $150,000. The QBI component of E's section 199A deduction is thus limited to $150,000, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($180,000) and the greater of the limitations amounts ($150,000). E's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the business as limited ($150,000) or 20% of E's taxable income ($880,000 × 20% = $176,000). Therefore, E's section 199A deduction is $150,000 for 2018.
(iv)
Example 4.
F, an unmarried individual, owns a 50% interest in Z, an S corporation for Federal income tax purposes that conducts a single trade or business. In 2018, Z reports QBI of $6,000,000. Z pays total W-2 wages of $2,000,000, and its total UBIA of qualified property is $200,000. For the 2018 taxable year, F reports $3,000,000 of QBI from Z. F is not an employee of Z and receives no wages or reasonable compensation from Z. After allowable deductions unrelated to Z and a deductible qualified net loss from a PTP of ($10,000), F's taxable income is $1,880,000. Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction will be limited to the lesser of 20% of F's share of Z's QBI or the greater of the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Twenty percent of F's share of Z's QBI ($3,000,000) is $600,000. The W-2 wage limitation equals 50% of F's share of Z's W-2 wages ($1,000,000) or $500,000. The UBIA of qualified property limitation equals $252,500, the sum of 25% of F's share of Z's W-2 wages ($1,000,000) or $250,000 plus 2.5% of E's share of UBIA of qualified property ($100,000) or $2,500. The greater of the limitation amounts ($500,000 and $252,500) is $500,000. The QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is thus limited to $500,000, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($600,000) and the greater of the limitations amounts ($500,000). F reports a qualified loss from a PTP and has no qualified REIT dividend. F does not net the ($10,000) loss from the PTP against QBI. Instead, the portion of F's section 199A deduction related to qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income is zero for 2018. F's section is 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the business as limited ($500,000) or 20% of F's taxable income over net capital gain ($1,880,000 x 20% = $376,000). Therefore, F's section 199A deduction is $376,000 for 2018. F must also carry forward the ($10,000) qualified loss from a PTP to be netted against F's qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income in the succeeding taxable year.
(v)
Example 5:
Phase-in range.
(A) B and C are married and file a joint individual income tax return. B is a shareholder in M, an entity taxed as an S corporation for Federal income tax purposes that conducts a single trade
or business. M holds no qualified property. B's share of the M's QBI is $300,000 in 2018. B's share of the W-2 wages from M in 2018 is $40,000. C earns wage income from employment by an unrelated company. After allowable deductions unrelated to M, B and C's taxable income for 2018 is $375,000. B and C are within the phase-in range because their taxable income exceeds the applicable threshold amount, $315,000, but does not exceed the threshold amount plus $100,000, or $415,000. Consequently, the QBI component of B and C's section 199A deduction may be limited by the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations but the limitations will be phased in.
(B) Because M does not hold qualified property, only the W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. In order to apply the W-2 wage limitation, B and C must first determine 20% of B's share of M's QBI. Twenty percent of B's share of M's QBI of $300,000 is $60,000. Next, B and C must determine 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages. Fifty percent of B's share of M's W-2 wages of $40,000 is $20,000. Because 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages ($20,000) is less than 20% of B's share of M's QBI ($60,000), B and C must determine the QBI component of their section 199A deduction by reducing 20% of B's share of M's QBI by the reduction amount.
(C) B and C are 60% through the phase-in range (that is, their taxable income exceeds the threshold amount by $60,000 and their phase-in range is $100,000). B and C must determine the excess amount, which is the excess of 20% of B's share of M's QBI, or $60,000, over 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages, or $20,000. Thus, the excess amount is $40,000. The reduction amount is equal to 60% of the excess amount, or $24,000. Thus, the QBI component of B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to $36,000, 20% of B's $300,000 share M's QBI (that is, $60,000), reduced by $24,000. B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the business as limited ($36,000) or 20% of B and C's taxable income ($375,000 × 20% = $75,000). Therefore, B and C's section 199A deduction is $36,000 for 2018.
(vi)
Example 6.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 5
of paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, except that M is engaged in an SSTB. Because B and C are within the phase-in range, B must reduce the QBI and W-2 wages allocable to B from M to the applicable percentage of those items. B and C's applicable percentage is 100% reduced by the percentage equal to the ratio that their taxable income for the taxable year ($375,000) exceeds their threshold amount ($315,000), or $60,000, bears to $100,000. Their applicable percentage is 40%. The applicable percentage of B's QBI is ($300,000 × 40% =) $120,000, and the applicable percentage of B's share of W-2 wages is ($40,000 × 40% =) $16,000. These reduced numbers must then be used to determine how B's section 199A deduction is limited.
(B) B and C must apply the W-2 wage limitation by first determining 20% of B's share of M's QBI as limited by paragraph (d)(4)(vi)(A) of this section. Twenty percent of B's share of M's QBI of $120,000 is $24,000. Next, B and C must determine 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages. Fifty percent of B's share of M's W-2 wages of $16,000 is $8,000. Because 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages ($8,000) is less than 20% of B's share of M's QBI ($24,000), B and C's must determine the QBI component of their section 199A deduction by reducing 20% of B's share of M's QBI by the reduction amount.
(C) B and C are 60% through the phase-in range (that is, their taxable income exceeds the threshold amount by $60,000 and their phase-in range is $100,000). B and C must determine the excess amount, which is the excess of 20% of B's share of M's QBI, as adjusted in paragraph (d)(4)(vi)(A) of this section or $24,000, over 50% of B's share of M's W-2 wages, as adjusted in paragraph (d)(4)(vi)(A) of this section, or $8,000. Thus, the excess amount is $16,000. The reduction amount is equal to 60% of the excess amount or $9,600. Thus, the QBI component of B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to $14,400, 20% of B's share M's QBI of $24,000, reduced by $9,600. B and C's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the business as limited ($14,400) or 20% of B's and C's taxable income ($375,000 × 20% = $75,000). Therefore, B and C's section 199A deduction is $14,400 for 2018.
(vii)
Example 7.
(A) F, an unmarried individual, owns as a sole proprietor 100 percent of three trades or businesses, Business X, Business Y, and Business Z. None of the businesses hold qualified property. F does not aggregate the trades or businesses under § 1.199A-4. For taxable year 2018, Business X generates $1 million of QBI and pays $500,000 of W-2 wages with respect to the business. Business Y also generates $1 million of QBI but pays no wages. Business Z generates $2,000 of QBI and pays $500,000 of W-2 wages with respect to the business. F also has $750,000 of wage income from employment with an unrelated company. After allowable deductions unrelated to the businesses, F's taxable income is $2,722,000.
(B) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. These limitations must be applied on a business-by-business basis. None of the businesses hold qualified property, therefore only the 50% of W-2 wage limitation must be calculated.Because QBI from each business is positive, F applies the limitation by determining the lesser of 20% of QBI and 50% of W-2 wages for each business.For Business X, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($1,000,000 × 20 percent = $200,000) and 50% of Business X's W-2 wages ($500,000 × 50% = $250,000) is $200,000. Business Y pays no W-2 wages. The lesser of 20% of Business Y's QBI($1,000,000 × 20% = $200,000) and 50% of its W-2 wages (zero) is zero.For Business Z, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($2,000 × 20% = $400) and 50% of W-2 wages ($500,000 × 50% = $250,000) is $400.
(C) Next, F must then combine the amounts determined in paragraph (d)(4)(vii)(B) of this section and compare that sum to 20% of F's taxable income. The lesser of these two amounts equals F's section 199A deduction. The total of the combined amounts in paragraph (d)(4)(vii)(B) of this section is $200,400 ($200,000 + zero + 400). Twenty percent of F's taxable income is $544,400 ($2,722,000 × 20%). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $200,400.

Example 8.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 7
of paragraph (d)(4)(vii) of this section, except that F aggregates Business X, Business Y, and Business Z under the rules of § 1.199A-4.
(B) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Because the businesses are aggregated, these limitations are applied on an aggregated basis. None of the businesses holds qualified property, therefore only the W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. F applies the limitation by determining the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the aggregated businesses, which is $400,400 ($2,002,000 × 20%) and 50% of W-2 wages from the aggregated businesses, which is $500,000 ($1,000,000 x 50%). F's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of $400,400 and 20% of F's taxable income ($2,722,000 × 20% = $544,400). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $400,400.
(ix)
Example 9.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 7
of paragraph (d)(4)(vii) of this section, except that for taxable year 2018, Business Z generates a loss that results in ($600,000) of negative QBI and pays $500,000 of W-2 wages. After allowable deductions unrelated to the businesses, F's taxable income is $2,120,000. Because Business Z had negative QBI, F must offset the positive QBI from Business X and Business Y with the negative QBI from Business Z in proportion to the relative amounts of positive QBI from Business X and Business Y. Because Business X and Business Y produced the same amount of positive QBI, the negative QBI from Business Z is apportioned equally among Business X and Business Y. Therefore, the adjusted QBI for each of Business X and Business Y is $700,000 ($1 million plus 50% of the negative QBI of $600,000). The adjusted QBI in Business Z is $0, because its negative QBI has been fully apportioned to Business X and Business Y.
(B) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. These limitations must be applied on a business-by-business basis. None of the businesses hold qualified property, therefore only the 50% of W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. For
Business X, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($700,000 × 20% = $140,000) and 50% of W-2 wages ($500,000 × 50% = $250,000) is $140,000. Business Y pays no W-2 wages. The lesser of 20% of Business Y's QBI ($700,000 × 20% = $140,000) and 50% of its W-2 wages (zero) is zero.
(C) F must combine the amounts determined in paragraph (d)(4)(ix)(B) of this section and compare the sum to 20% of taxable income. F's section 199A deduction equals the lesser of these two amounts. The combined amount from paragraph (d)(4)(ix)(B) of this section is $140,000 ($140,000 + zero) and 20% of F's taxable income is $424,000 ($2,120,000 × 20%). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $140,000. There is no carryover of any loss into the following taxable year for purposes of section 199A.
(x)
Example 10.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 9
of paragraph (d)(4)(ix) of this section, except that F aggregates Business X, Business Y, and Business Z under the rules of § 1.199A-4.
(B) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. Because the businesses are aggregated, these limitations are applied on an aggregated basis. None of the businesses holds qualified property, therefore only the W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. F applies the limitation by determining the lesser of 20% of the QBI from the aggregated businesses ($1,400,000 × 20% = $280,000) and 50% of W-2 wages from the aggregated businesses ($1,000,000 × 50% = $500,000), or $280,000. F's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of $280,000 and 20% of F's taxable income ($2,120,000 × 20% = $424,000). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $280,000. There is no carryover of any loss into the following taxable year for purposes of section 199A.
(xi)
Example 11.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 7
of paragraph (d)(4)(vii) of this section, except that Business Z generates a loss that results in ($2,150,000) of negative QBI and pays $500,000 of W-2 wages with respect to the business in 2018. Thus, F has a negative combined QBI of ($150,000) when the QBI from all of the businesses are added together ($1 million plus $1 million minus the loss of ($2,150,000)). Because F has a negative combined QBI for 2018, F has no section 199A deduction with respect to any trade or business for 2018. Instead, the negative combined QBI of ($150,000) carries forward and will be treated as negative QBI from a separate trade or business for purposes of computing the section 199A deduction in the next taxable year. None of the W-2 wages carry forward. However, for income tax purposes, the $150,000 loss may offset F's $750,000 of wage income (assuming the loss is otherwise allowable under the Code).
(B) In taxable year 2019, Business X generates $200,000 of net QBI and pays $100,000 of W-2 wages with respect to the business. Business Y generates $150,000 of net QBI but pays no wages. Business Z generates a loss that results in ($120,000) of negative QBI and pays $500 of W-2 wages with respect to the business. F also has $750,000 of wage income from employment with an unrelated company. After allowable deductions unrelated to the businesses, F's taxable income is $960,000. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the ($150,000) of negative QBI from 2018 is treated as arising in 2019 from a separate trade or business. Thus, F has overall net QBI of $80,000 when all trades or businesses are taken together ($200,000) plus $150,000 minus $120,000 minus the carryover loss of ($150,000). Because Business Z had negative QBI and F also has a negative QBI carryover amount, F must offset the positive QBI from Business X and Business Y with the negative QBI from Business Z and the carryover amount in proportion to the relative amounts of positive QBI from Business X and Business Y. Because Business X produced 57.14% of the total QBI from Business X and Business Y, 57.14% of the negative QBI from Business Z and the negative QBI carryforward must be apportioned to Business X, and the remaining 42.86% allocated to Business Y. Therefore, the adjusted QBI in Business X is $45,722 ($200,000 minus 57.14% of the loss from Business Z ($68,568), minus 57.14% of the carryover loss ($85,710). The adjusted QBI in Business Y is $34,278 ($150,000, minus 42.86% of the loss from
Business Z ($51,432) minus 42.86% of the carryover loss ($64,290)). The adjusted QBI in Business Z is $0, because its negative QBI has been apportioned to Business X and Business Y.
(C) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. These limitations must be applied on a business-by-business basis. None of the businesses hold qualified property, therefore only the 50% of W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. For Business X, 20% of QBI is $9,144 ($45,722 × 20%) and 50% of W-2 wages is $50,000 ($100,000 × 50%), so the lesser amount is $9,144. Business Y pays no W-2 wages. Twenty percent of Business Y's QBI is $6,856 ($34,278 × 20%) and 50% of its W-2 wages (zero) is zero, so the lesser amount is zero.
(D) F must then compare the combined amounts determined in paragraph (d)(4)(xi)(C) of this section to 20% of F's taxable income. The section 199A deduction equals the lesser of these amounts. F's combined amount from paragraph (d)(4)(xi)(C) of this section is $9,144 ($9,144 plus zero) and 20% of F's taxable income is $192,000 ($960,000 × 20%) Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2019 is $9,144. There is no carryover of any negative QBI into the following taxable year for purposes of section 199A.
(xii)
Example 12.
(A) Assume the same facts as in
Example 11
of paragraph (d)(4)(xi) of this section, except that F aggregates Business X, Business Y, and Business Z under the rules of § 1.199A-4. For 2018, F's QBI from the aggregated trade or business is ($150,000). Because F has a combined negative QBI for 2018, F has no section 199A deduction with respect to any trade or business for 2018. Instead, the negative combined QBI of ($150,000) carries forward and will be treated as negative QBI from a separate trade or business for purposes of computing the section 199A deduction in the next taxable year. However, for income tax purposes, the $150,000 loss may offset taxpayer's $750,000 of wage income (assuming the loss is otherwise allowable under the Code).
(B) In taxable year 2019, F will have QBI of $230,000 and W-2 wages of $100,500 from the aggregated trade or business. F also has $750,000 of wage income from employment with an unrelated company. After allowable deductions unrelated to the businesses, F's taxable income is $960,000. F must treat the negative QBI carryover loss ($150,000) from 2018 as a loss from a separate trade or business for purposes of section 199A. This loss will offset the positive QBI from the aggregated trade or business, resulting in an adjusted QBI of $80,000 ($230,000 − $150,000).
(C) Because F's taxable income is above the threshold amount, the QBI component of F's section 199A deduction is subject to the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. These limitations must be applied on a business-by-business basis. None of the businesses hold qualified property, therefore only the 50% of W-2 wage limitation must be calculated. For the aggregated trade or business, the lesser of 20% of QBI ($80,000 × 20% = $16,000) and 50% of W-2 wages ($100,500 × 50% = $50,250) is $16,000. F's section 199A deduction equals the lesser of that amount ($16,000) and 20% of F's taxable income ($960,000 × 20% = $192,000). Thus, F's section 199A deduction for 2019 is $16,000. There is no carryover of any negative QBI into the following taxable year for purposes of section 199A.
(e)
Special rules
—(1)
Effect of deduction.
In the case of a partnership or S corporation, section 199A is applied at the partner or shareholder level. The rules of subchapter K and subchapter S of the Code apply in their entirety for purposes of determining each partner's or shareholder's share of QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income or loss. The section 199A deduction has no effect on the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in the partnership, the adjusted basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation, or an S corporation's accumulated adjustments account.
(2)
Disregarded entities.
An entity with a single owner that is treated as disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under any provision of the Code is disregarded for purposes of section 199A and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6.
(3)
Self-employment tax and net investment income tax.
The deduction allowed
under section 199A does not reduce net earnings from self-employment under section 1402 or net investment income under section 1411.
(4)
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
If all of an individual's QBI from sources within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is taxable under section 1 of the Code for a taxable year, then for purposes of determining the QBI of such individual for such taxable year, the term “United States” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(5)
Coordination with alternative minimum tax.
For purposes of determining alternative minimum taxable income under section 55, the deduction allowed under section 199A(a) for a taxable year is equal in amount to the deduction allowed under section 199A(a) in determining taxable income for that taxable year (that is, without regard to any adjustments under sections 56 through 59).
(6)
Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on underpayments.
For rules related to the imposition of the accuracy-related penalty on underpayments for taxpayers who claim the deduction allowed under section 199A, see section 6662(d)(1)(C).
(7)
Reduction for income received from cooperatives.
In the case of any trade or business of a patron of a
specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative,
as defined in section 199A(g)(4), the amount of section 199A deduction determined under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section with respect to such trade or business must be reduced by the lesser of:
(i) Nine percent of the QBI with respect to such trade or business as is properly allocable to qualified payments received from such cooperative; or
(ii) 50 percent of the W-2 wages with respect to such trade or business as are so allocable as determined under § 1.199A-2.
(f)
Applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section apply to taxable years ending after February 8, 2019.
(2)
Exception for non-calendar year RPE.
For purposes of determining QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income, if an individual receives any of these items from an RPE with a taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018, and ends after December 31, 2017, such items are treated as having been incurred by the individual during the individual's taxable year in which or with which such RPE taxable year ends.
[T.D. 9847, 84 FR 2989, Feb. 8, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9847, 84 FR 15954, Apr. 17, 2019]
§ 1.199A-2
Determination of W-2 wages and unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
This section provides guidance on calculating a trade or business's W-2 wages properly allocable to QBI (W-2 wages) and the trade or business's unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of all qualified property (UBIA of qualified property). The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
(2)
W-2 wages.
Paragraph (b) of this section provides guidance on the determination of W-2 wages. The determination of W-2 wages must be made for each trade or business by the individual or RPE that directly conducts the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business). In the case of W-2 wages paid by an RPE, the RPE must determine and report W-2 wages for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) conducted by the RPE. W-2 wages are presumed to be zero if not determined and reported for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business).
(3)
UBIA of qualified property
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (c) of this section provides guidance on the determination of the UBIA of qualified property. The determination of the UBIA of qualified property must be made for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) by the individual or RPE that directly conducts the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business). The UBIA of qualified property is presumed to be zero if not determined and reported for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business).
(ii)
UBIA of qualified property held by a partnership.
In the case of qualified property held by a partnership, each partner's share of the UBIA of qualified property is determined in accordance with how the partnership would allocate depreciation under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
g
) on the last day of the taxable year.
(iii)
UBIA of qualified property held by an S corporation.
In the case of qualified property held by an S corporation, each shareholder's share of the UBIA of qualified property is the share of the unadjusted basis proportionate to the ratio of shares in the S corporation held by the shareholder on the last day of the taxable year over the total issued and outstanding shares of the S corporation.
(iv)
UBIA and section 743(b) basis adjustments
—(A)
In general.
A partner will be allowed to take into account UBIA with respect to an item of qualified property in addition to the amount of UBIA with respect to such qualified property determined under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (c) of this section and allocated to such partner under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent of the partner's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to such item of qualified property.
(B)
Excess section 743(b) basis adjustments.
A partner's
excess section 743(b) basis adjustment
is an amount that is determined with respect to each item of qualified property and is equal to an amount that would represent the partner's section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to the same item of qualified property, as determined under §§ 1.743-1(b) and 1.755-1, but calculated as if the adjusted basis of all of the partnership's property was equal to the UBIA of such property. The absolute value of the excess section 743(b) basis adjustment cannot exceed the absolute value of the total section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to qualified property.
(C)
Computation of partner's share of UBIA with excess section 743(b) basis adjustments.
The partnership first computes its UBIA with respect to qualified property under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (c) of this section and allocates such UBIA under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. If the sum of the excess section 743(b) basis adjustment for all of the items of qualified property is a negative number, that amount will be subtracted from the partner's UBIA of qualified property determined under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (c) of this section and allocated under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. A partner's UBIA of qualified property may not be below $0. Excess section 743(b) basis adjustments are computed with respect to all section 743(b) adjustments, including adjustments made as a result of a substantial built-in loss under section 743(d).
(D)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (a)(3)(iv) are illustrated by the following examples:

Facts.
A, B, and C are equal partners in partnership, PRS. PRS has a single trade or business that generates QBI. PRS has no liabilities and only one asset, a single item of qualified property with a UBIA equal to $900,000. Each partner's share of the UBIA is $300,000. A sells its one-third interest in PRS to T for $350,000 when a section 754 election is in effect. At the time of the sale, the tax basis of the qualified property held by PRS is $750,000. The amount of gain that would be allocated to T from a hypothetical transaction under § 1.743-1(d)(2) is $100,000. Thus, T's interest in PRS's previously taxed capital is equal to $250,000 ($350,000, the amount of cash T would receive if PRS liquidated immediately after the hypothetical transaction, decreased by $100,000, T's share of gain from the hypothetical transaction). The amount of T's section 743(b) basis adjustment to PRS's qualified property is $100,000 (the excess of $350,000, T's cost basis for its interest, over $250,000, T's share of the adjusted basis to PRS of the partnership's property).

Analysis.
In order for T to determine its UBIA, T must calculate its excess section 743(b) basis adjustment. T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment is equal to an amount that would represent T's section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to the same item of qualified property, as determined under §§ 1.743-1(b) and 1.755-1, but calculated as if the adjusted basis of all of PRS's property was equal to the UBIA
of such property. T's section 743(b) basis adjustment calculated as if adjusted basis of the qualified property were equal to its UBIA is $50,000 (the excess of $350,000, T's cost basis for its interest, over $300,000, T's share of the adjusted basis to PRS of the partnership's property). Thus, T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment is equal to $50,000. For purposes of applying the UBIA limitation to T's share of QBI from PRS's trade or business, T's UBIA is equal to $350,000 ($300,000, T's one-third share of the qualified property's UBIA, plus $50,000, T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment).

At the time of the sale, the tax basis of the qualified property held by PRS is $750,000, and the amount of loss that would be allocated to T from a hypothetical transaction under § 1.743-1(d)(2) is $50,000. Thus, T's interest in PRS's previously taxed capital is equal to $250,000 ($200,000, the amount of cash T would receive if PRS liquidated immediately after the hypothetical transaction, increased by $50,000, T's share of loss from the hypothetical transaction). The amount of T's section 743(b) basis adjustment to PRS's qualified property is negative $50,000 (the excess of $250,000, T's share of the adjusted basis to PRS of the partnership's property, over $200,000, T's cost basis for its interest).

Analysis.
In order for T to determine its UBIA, T must calculate its excess section 743(b) basis adjustment. T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment is equal to an amount that would represent T's section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to the same item of qualified property, as determined under §§ 1.743-1(b) and 1.755-1, but calculated as if the adjusted basis of all of PRS's property was equal to the UBIA of such property. T's section 743(b) basis adjustment calculated as if adjusted basis of the qualified property were equal to its UBIA is negative $100,000 (the excess of $300,000, T's share of the adjusted basis to PRS of the partnership's property, over $200,000, T's cost basis for its interest). T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment to the qualified property is limited to the amount of T's section 743(b) basis adjustment of negative $50,000. Thus, T's excess section 743(b) basis adjustment is equal to negative $50,000. For purposes of applying the UBIA limitation to T's share of QBI from PRS's trade or business, T's UBIA is equal to $250,000 ($300,000, T's one-third share of the qualified property's UBIA, reduced by T's negative $50,000 excess section 743(b) basis adjustment).

W-2 wages
—(1)
In general.
Section 199A(b)(2)(B) provides limitations on the section 199A deduction based on the W-2 wages paid with respect to each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business). Section 199A(b)(4)(B) provides that W-2 wages do not include any amount which is not properly allocable to QBI for purposes of section 199A(c)(1). This section provides a three step process for determining the W-2 wages paid with respect to a trade or business that are properly allocable to QBI. First, each individual or RPE must determine its total W-2 wages paid for the taxable year under the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Second, each individual or RPE must allocate its W-2 wages between or among one or more trades or businesses under the rules in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Third, each individual or RPE must determine the amount of such wages with respect to each trade or business, which are allocable to the QBI of the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) under the rules in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

Definition of W-2 wages
—(i)
In general.
Section 199A(b)(4)(A) provides that the term W-2 wages means with respect to any person for any taxable year of such person, the amounts described in section 6051(a)(3) and (8) paid by such person with respect to employment of employees by such person during the calendar year ending during such taxable year. Thus, the term W-2 wages includes the total amount of wages as defined in section 3401(a) plus the total amount of elective deferrals (within the meaning of section 402(g)(3)), the compensation deferred under section 457, and the amount of designated Roth contributions (as defined in section
402A). For this purpose, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(C)(

) and (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, the Forms W-2, “Wage and Tax Statement,” or any subsequent form or document used in determining the amount of W-2 wages, are those issued for the calendar year ending during the individual's or RPE's taxable year for wages paid to employees (or former employees) of the individual or RPE for employment by the individual or RPE. For purposes of this section, employees of the individual or RPE are limited to employees of the individual or RPE as defined in section 3121(d)(1) and (2). (For purposes of section 199A, this includes officers of an S corporation and employees of an individual or RPE under common law.)
(ii)
Wages paid by a person other than a common law employer.
In determining W-2 wages, an individual or RPE may take into account any W-2 wages paid by another person and reported by the other person on Forms W-2 with the other person as the employer listed in Box c of the Forms W-2, provided that the W-2 wages were paid to common law employees or officers of the individual or RPE for employment by the individual or RPE. In such cases, the person paying the W-2 wages and reporting the W-2 wages on Forms W-2 is precluded from taking into account such wages for purposes of determining W-2 wages with respect to that person. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), persons that pay and report W-2 wages on behalf of or with respect to others can include, but are not limited to, certified professional employer organizations under section 7705, statutory employers under section 3401(d)(1), and agents under section 3504.
(iii)
Requirement that wages must be reported on return filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA)
—(A)
In general.
Pursuant to section 199A(b)(4)(C), the term W-2 wages does not include any amount that is not properly included in a return filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for such return. Under § 31.6051-2 of this chapter, each Form W-2 and the transmittal Form W-3, “Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements,” together constitute an information return to be filed with SSA. Similarly, each Form W-2c, “Corrected Wage and Tax Statement,” and the transmittal Form W-3 or W-3c, “Transmittal of Corrected Wage and Tax Statements,” together constitute an information return to be filed with SSA. In determining whether any amount has been properly included in a return filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for such return, each Form W-2 together with its accompanying Form W-3 will be considered a separate information return and each Form W-2c together with its accompanying Form W-3 or Form W-3c will be considered a separate information return. Section 6071(c) provides that Forms W-2 and W-3 must be filed on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which such returns relate (but see the special rule in § 31.6071(a)-1T(a)(3)(i) of this chapter for monthly returns filed under § 31.6011(a)-5(a) of this chapter).Corrected Forms W-2 are required to be filed with SSA on or before January 31 of the year following the year in which the correction is made.
(B)
Corrected return filed to correct a return that was filed within 60 days of the due date.
If a corrected information return (Return B) is filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return B to correct an information return (Return A) that was filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the information return (Return A) and paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section does not apply, then the wage information on Return B must be included in determining W-2 wages. If a corrected information return (Return D) is filed with SSA later than the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return D to correct an information return (Return C) that was filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the information return (Return C), and if Return D reports an increase (or increases) in wages included in determining W-2 wages from the wage amounts reported on Return C, then such increase (or increases) on Return D will be disregarded in determining W-2 wages (and only the wage amounts
on Return C may be included in determining W-2 wages). If Return D reports a decrease (or decreases) in wages included in determining W-2 wages from the amounts reported on Return C, then, in determining W-2 wages, the wages reported on Return C must be reduced by the decrease (or decreases) reflected on Return D.
(C)
Corrected return filed to correct a return that was filed later than 60 days after the due date.
If an information return (Return F) is filed to correct an information return (Return E) that was not filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return E, then Return F (and any subsequent information returns filed with respect to Return E) will not be considered filed on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return F (or the subsequent corrected information return). Thus, if a Form W-2c is filed to correct a Form W-2 that was not filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the Form W-2 (or to correct a Form W-2c relating to Form W-2 that had not been filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the Form W-2), then this Form W-2c will not be considered to have been filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for this Form W-2c (or corrected Form W-2), regardless of when the Form W-2c is filed.
(iv)
Methods for calculating W-2 wages
—(A)
In general.
The Secretary may provide for methods to be used in calculating W-2 wages, including W-2 wages for short taxable years by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(B)
Acquisition or disposition of a trade or business
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of an acquisition or disposition of a trade or business, the major portion of a trade or business, or the major portion of a separate unit of a trade or business that causes more than one individual or entity to be an employer of the employees of the acquired or disposed of trade or business during the calendar year, the W-2 wages of the individual or entity for the calendar year of the acquisition or disposition are allocated between each individual or entity based on the period during which the employees of the acquired or disposed of trade or business were employed by the individual or entity, regardless of which permissible method is used for reporting predecessor and successor wages on Form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statement.” For this purpose, the period of employment is determined consistently with the principles for determining whether an individual is an employee described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(
2
)
Acquisition or disposition.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B), the term
acquisition or disposition
includes an incorporation, a formation, a liquidation, a reorganization, or a purchase or sale of assets.
(C)
Application in the case of a person with a short taxable year
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of an individual or RPE with a short taxable year, subject to the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the W-2 wages of the individual or RPE for the short taxable year include only those wages paid during the short taxable year to employees of the individuals or RPE, only those elective deferrals (within the meaning of section 402(g)(3)) made during the short taxable year by employees of the individual or RPE and only compensation actually deferred under section 457 during the short taxable year with respect to employees of the individual or RPE.
(
2
)
Short taxable year that does not include December 31.
If an individual or RPE has a short taxable year that does not contain a calendar year ending during such short taxable year, wages paid to employees for employment by such individual or RPE during the short taxable year are treated as W-2 wages for such short taxable year for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section (if the wages would otherwise meet the requirements to be W-2 wages under this section but for the requirement that a calendar year must end during the short taxable year).
(D)
Remuneration paid for services performed in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
In the case of an individual or RPE that conducts a trade or business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the determination of W-2 wages of such
individual or RPE will be made without regard to any exclusion under section 3401(a)(8) for remuneration paid for services performed in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The individual or RPE must maintain sufficient documentation (for example, Forms 499R-2/W-2PR) to substantiate the amount of remuneration paid for services performed in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that is used in determining the W-2 wages of such individual or RPE with respect to any trade or business conducted in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(3)
Allocation of wages to trades or businesses.
After calculating total W-2 wages for a taxable year, each individual or RPE that directly conducts more than one trade or business must allocate those wages among its various trades or businesses. W-2 wages must be allocated to the trade or business that generated those wages. In the case of W-2 wages that are allocable to more than one trade or business, the portion of the W-2 wages allocable to each trade or business is determined in the same manner as the expenses associated with those wages are allocated among the trades or businesses under § 1.199A-3(b)(5).
(4)
Allocation of wages to QBI.
Once W-2 wages for each trade or business have been determined, each individual or RPE must identify the amount of W-2 wages properly allocable to QBI for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business). W-2 wages are properly allocable to QBI if the associated wage expense is taken into account in computing QBI under § 1.199A-3. In the case of an RPE, the wage expense must be allocated and reported to the partners or shareholders of the RPE as required by the Code, including subchapters K and S of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code. The RPE must also identify and report the associated W-2 wages to its partners or shareholders.
(5)
Non-duplication rule.
Amounts that are treated as W-2 wages for a taxable year under any method cannot be treated as W-2 wages of any other taxable year. Also, an amount cannot be treated as W-2 wages by more than one trade or business (or aggregated trade or business).
(c)
UBIA of qualified property
—(1)
Qualified property
—(i)
In general.
The term
qualified property
means, with respect to any trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) of an individual or RPE for a taxable year, tangible property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a)—
(A) Which is held by, and available for use in, the trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) at the close of the taxable year;
(B) Which is used at any point during the taxable year in the trade or business's (or aggregated trade or business's) production of QBI; and
(C) The depreciable period for which has not ended before the close of the individual's or RPE's taxable year.
(ii)
Improvements to qualified property.
In the case of any addition to, or improvement of, qualified property that has already been placed in service by the individual or RPE, such addition or improvement is treated as separate qualified property first placed in service on the date such addition or improvement is placed in service for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b).
Excess section 743(b) basis adjustments as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section are treated as qualified property. Otherwise, basis adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b) are not treated as qualified property.
(iv)
Property acquired at end of year.
Property is not qualified property if the property is acquired within 60 days of the end of the taxable year and disposed of within 120 days of acquisition without having been used in a trade or business for at least 45 days prior to disposition, unless the taxpayer demonstrates that the principal purpose of the acquisition and disposition was a purpose other than increasing the section 199A deduction.
(2)
Depreciable period
—(i)
In general.
The term
depreciable period
means, with respect to qualified property of a trade or business, the period beginning on the date the property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE and ending on the later of—
(A) The date that is 10 years after such date; or
(B) The last day of the last full year in the applicable recovery period that would apply to the property under section 168(c), regardless of any application of section 168(g).
(ii)
Additional first-year depreciation under section 168.
The additional first-year depreciation deduction allowable under section 168 (for example, under section 168(k) or (m)) does not affect the applicable recovery period under this paragraph for the qualified property.
(iii)
Qualified property acquired in transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the following rules apply to qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion (replacement property).
(A)
Replacement property received in a section 1031 or 1033 transaction.
The date on which replacement property that is of like-kind to relinquished property or is similar or related in service or use to involuntarily converted property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE is determined as follows—
(
1
) For the portion of the individual's or RPE's UBIA, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in such replacement property that does not exceed the individual's or RPE's UBIA in the relinquished property or involuntarily converted property, the date such portion in the replacement property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE is the date on which the relinquished property or involuntarily converted property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE; and
(
2
) For the portion of the individual's or RPE's UBIA, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in such replacement property that exceeds the individual's or RPE's UBIA in the relinquished property or involuntarily converted property, such portion in the replacement property is treated as separate qualified property that the individual or RPE first placed in service on the date on which the replacement property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE.
(B)
Other property received in a section 1031 or 1033 transaction.
Other property, as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, that is qualified property is treated as separate qualified property that the individual or RPE first placed in service on the date on which such other property was first placed in service by the individual or RPE.
(iv)
Qualified property acquired in transactions described in section 168(i)(7)(B).
If an individual or RPE acquires qualified property in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition transactions), the individual or RPE must determine the date on which the qualified property was first placed in service solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section as follows—
(A) For the portion of the transferee's UBIA in the qualified property that does not exceed the transferor's UBIA in such property, the date such portion was first placed in service by the transferee is the date on which the transferor first placed the qualified property in service; and
(B) For the portion of the transferee's UBIA in the qualified property that exceeds the transferor's UBIA in such property, such portion is treated as separate qualified property that the transferee first placed in service on the date of the transfer.
(v)
Excess section 743(b) basis adjustment.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, an excess section 743(b) basis adjustment with respect to an item of partnership property that is qualified property is treated as being placed in service when the transfer of the partnership interest occurs, and the recovery period for such property is determined under § 1.743-1(j)(4)(i)(B) with respect to positive basis adjustments and § 1.743-1(j)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to negative basis adjustments.
(3)
Unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) through (v) of this section, the term
unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition
(UBIA) means the basis on the placed in service date of the property as determined under section 1012 or other applicable sections of chapter 1 of the Code, including the provisions of subchapters O (relating to gain or loss on dispositions of property), C (relating
to corporate distributions and adjustments), K (relating to partners and partnerships), and P (relating to capital gains and losses). UBIA is determined without regard to any adjustments described in section 1016(a)(2) or (3), to any adjustments for tax credits claimed by the individual or RPE (for example, under section 50(c)), or to any adjustments for any portion of the basis which the individual or RPE has elected to treat as an expense (for example, under sections 179, 179B, or 179C). However, UBIA does reflect the reduction in basis for the percentage of the individual's or RPE's use of property for the taxable year other than in the trade or business.
(ii)
Qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange
—(A)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this section, if property that is qualified property (replacement property) is acquired in a like-kind exchange that qualifies for deferral of gain or loss under section 1031, then the UBIA of such property is the same as the UBIA of the qualified property exchanged (relinquished property), decreased by excess boot or increased by the amount of money paid or the fair market value of property not of a like kind to the relinquished property (other property) transferred by the taxpayer to acquire the replacement property. If the taxpayer acquires more than one piece of qualified property as replacement property that is of a like kind to the relinquished property in an exchange described in section 1031, UBIA is apportioned between or among the qualified replacement properties in proportion to their relative fair market values. Other property received by the taxpayer in a section 1031 transaction that is qualified property has a UBIA equal to the fair market value of such other property.
(B)
Excess boot.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section,
excess boot
is the amount of any money or the fair market value of other property received by the taxpayer in the exchange over the amount of appreciation in the relinquished property. Appreciation for this purpose is the excess of the fair market value of the relinquished property on the date of the exchange over the fair market value of the relinquished property on the date of the acquisition by the taxpayer.
(iii)
Qualified property acquired pursuant to an involuntary conversion
—(A)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this section, if qualified property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted (converted property) within the meaning of section 1033 and qualified replacement property is acquired in a transaction that qualifies for deferral of gain under section 1033, then the UBIA of the replacement property is the same as the UBIA of the converted property, decreased by excess boot or increased by the amount of money paid or the fair market value of property not similar or related in service or use to the converted property (other property) transferred by the taxpayer to acquire the replacement property. If the taxpayer acquires more than one piece of qualified replacement property that meets the similar or related in service or use requirements in section 1033, UBIA is apportioned between the qualified replacement properties in proportion to their relative fair market values. Other property acquired by the taxpayer with the proceeds of an involuntary conversion that is qualified property has a UBIA equal to the fair market value of such other property.
(B)
Excess boot.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section,
excess boot
is the amount of any money or the fair market value of other property received by the taxpayer in the conversion over the amount of appreciation in the converted property. Appreciation for this purpose is the excess of the fair market value of the converted property on the date of the conversion over the fair market value of the converted property on the date of the acquisition by the taxpayer.
(iv)
Qualified property acquired in transactions described in section 168(i)(7)(B).
Solely for purposes of this section, if qualified property is acquired in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition transactions), the transferee's UBIA in the qualified property shall be the same as the transferor's UBIA in the property, decreased by the amount of money received by the
transferor in the transaction or increased by the amount of money paid by the transferee to acquire the property in the transaction.
(v)
Qualified property acquired from a decedent.
In the case of qualified property acquired from a decedent and immediately placed in service, the UBIA of the property will generally be the fair market value at the date of the decedent's death under section 1014. See section 1014 and the regulations thereunder. Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a new depreciable period for the property commences as of the date of the decedent's death.
(vi)
Property acquired in a nonrecognition transaction with principal purpose of increasing UBIA.
If qualified property is acquired in a transaction described in section 1031, 1033, or 168(i)(7) with the principal purpose of increasing the UBIA of the qualified property, the UBIA of the acquired qualified property is its basis as determined under relevant Code sections and not under the rules described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. For example, in a section 1031 transaction undertaken with the principal purpose of increasing the UBIA of the replacement property, the UBIA of the replacement property is its basis as determined under section 1031(d).
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
(A) On January 5, 2012, A purchases Real Property X for $1 million and places it in service in A's trade or business. A's trade or business is not an SSTB. A's basis in Real Property X under section 1012 is $1 million. Real Property X is qualified property within the meaning of section 199A(b)(6). As of December 31, 2018, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2) for depreciation deductions under section 168(a), is $821,550.
(B) For purposes of section 199A(b)(2)(B)(ii) and this section, A's UBIA of Real Property X is its $1 million cost basis under section 1012, regardless of any later depreciation deductions under section 168(a) and resulting basis adjustments under section 1016(a)(2).
(ii)
Example 2.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031 in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property Y has a value of $1 million. No cash or other property is involved in the exchange. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2) for depreciation deductions under section 168(a), is $820,482.
(B) A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $1 million as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, Real Property Y is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A.
(iii)
Example 3.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031, in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property X has appreciated in value to $1.3 million, and Real Property Y also has a value of $1.3 million. No cash or other property is involved in the exchange. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2), is $820,482.
(B) A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $1 million as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, Real Property Y is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A.
(iv)
Example 4.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031, in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property X has appreciated in value to $1.3 million, but Real Property Y has a value of $1.5 million. A therefore adds $200,000 in cash to the exchange of Real Property X for Real Property Y. On January 15, 2019, A places Real Property Y in service. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2), is $820,482.
(B) A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $1.2 million as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section ($1 million in UBIA from Real Property X plus $200,000 cash paid by A to acquire Real Property Y). Because the UBIA of Real Property Y exceeds the UBIA of Real Property X, Real Property Y is treated as being two separate qualified properties for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. One property has a UBIA of $1 million (the portion of A's UBIA of $1.2 million in Real Property Y that does not exceed A's UBIA of $1 million in Real Property X) and it is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A. The other property has a UBIA of $200,000 (the portion of A's UBIA of $1.2 million in Real Property Y that exceeds A's UBIA of $1 million in Real Property X) and it is first placed in service by A on January 15, 2019, which is the date on which Real Property Y was first placed in service by A.
(v)
Example 5.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031, in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property X has appreciated in value to $1.3 million. Real Property Y has a fair market value of $1 million. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2), is $820,482. Pursuant to the exchange, A receives Real Property Y and $300,000 in cash.
(B) A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $1 million as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section ($1 million in UBIA from Real Property X, less $0 excess boot ($300,000 cash received in the exchange over $300,000 in appreciation in Property X, which is equal to the excess of the $1.3 million fair market value of Property X on the date of the exchange over $1 million fair market value of Property X on the date of acquisition by the taxpayer)). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, Real Property Y is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A.
(vi)
Example 6.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031, in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property X has appreciated in value to $1.3 million. Real Property Y has a fair market value of $900,000. Pursuant to the exchange, A receives Real Property Y and $400,000 in cash. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2), is $820,482.
(B) A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $900,000 as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section ($1 million in UBIA from Real Property X less $100,000 excess boot ($400,000 in cash received in the exchange over $300,000 in appreciation in Property X, which is equal to the excess of the $1.3 million fair market value of Property X on the date of the exchange over the $1 million fair market value of Property X on the date of acquisition by the taxpayer)). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, Real Property Y is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A.
(vii)
Example 7.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that on January 15, 2019, A enters into a like-kind exchange under section 1031, in which A exchanges Real Property X for Real Property Y. Real Property X has declined in value to $900,000, and Real Property Y also has a value of $900,000. No cash or other property is involved in the exchange. As of January 15, 2019, A's basis in Real Property X, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2), is $820,482.
(B) Even though Real Property Y is worth only $900,000, A's UBIA in Real Property Y is $1 million as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section because no cash or other property was involved in the exchange. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, Real Property Y is first placed in service by A on January 5, 2012, which is the date on which Real Property X was first placed in service by A.
(viii)
Example 8.
(A) C operates a trade or business that is not an SSTB as a sole proprietorship. On January 5, 2011, C purchases Machinery Y for $10,000 and places it in service in C's trade or business. C's basis in Machinery Y under section 1012 is $10,000. Machinery Y is qualified property within the meaning of section 199A(b)(6). Assume that Machinery Y's recovery period under section 168(c) is 10 years, and C depreciates Machinery Y under the general depreciation system by using the straight-line depreciation method, a 10-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. As of December 31, 2018, C's basis in Machinery Y, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2) for depreciation deductions under section 168(a), is $2,500. On January 1, 2019, C incorporates the sole proprietorship and elects to treat the newly formed entity as an S corporation for Federal income tax purposes. C contributes Machinery Y and all other assets of the trade or business to the S corporation in a non-recognition transaction under section 351. The S corporation immediately places all the assets in service.
(B) For purposes of section 199A(b)(2)(B)(ii) and this section, C's UBIA of Machinery Y from 2011 through 2018 is its $10,000 cost basis under section 1012, regardless of any later depreciation deductions under section 168(a) and resulting basis adjustments under section 1016(a)(2). The S corporation's basis of Machinery Y is $2,500, the basis of the property under section 362 at the time the S corporation places the property in service. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, S corporation's UBIA of Machinery Y is $10,000, which is C's UBIA of Machinery Y. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, for purposes of determining the depreciable period of Machinery Y, the S corporation's placed in service date of Machinery Y will be January 5, 2011, which is the date C originally placed the property in service in 2011. Therefore, Machinery Y may be qualified property of the S corporation (assuming it continues to be used in the business) for 2019 and 2020 and will not be qualified property of the S corporation after 2020, because its depreciable period will have expired.

Example 9.
(A) LLC, a partnership, operates a trade or business that is not an SSTB. On January 5, 2011, LLC purchases Machinery Z for $30,000 and places it in service in LLC's trade or business. LLC's basis in Machinery Z under section 1012 is $30,000. Machinery Z is qualified property within the meaning of section 199A(b)(6). Assume that Machinery Z's recovery period under section 168(c) is 10 years, and LLC depreciates Machinery Z under the general depreciation system by using the straight-line depreciation method, a 10-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. As of December 31, 2018, LLC's basis in Machinery Z, as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2) for depreciation deductions under section 168(a), is $7,500. On January 1, 2019, LLC distributes Machinery Z to Partner A in full liquidation of Partner A's interest in LLC. Partner A's outside basis in LLC is $35,000.
(B) For purposes of section 199A(b)(2)(B)(ii) and this section, LLC's UBIA of Machinery Z from 2011 through 2018 is its $30,000 cost basis under section 1012, regardless of any later depreciation deductions under section 168(a) and resulting basis adjustments under section 1016(a)(2). Prior to the distribution to Partner A, LLC's basis of Machinery Z is $7,500. Under section 732(b), Partner A's basis in Machinery Z is $35,000. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, upon distribution of Machinery Z, Partner A's UBIA of Machinery Z is $30,000, which was LLC's UBIA of Machinery Z.

[T.D. 9847, 84 FR 2995, Feb. 8, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9847, 84 FR 15954, Apr. 17, 2019]
§ 1.199A-3
Qualified business income, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules on the determination of a trade or business's qualified business income (QBI), as well as the determination of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for the determination of QBI. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for the determination of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income. QBI must be determined and reported for each trade or business by the individual or relevant passthrough entity (RPE) that directly conducts the trade or business before applying the aggregation rules of § 1.199A-4.
(b)
Definition of qualified business income
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
qualified business income
or
QBI
means, for any taxable year, the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to any trade or business of the taxpayer as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, provided the other requirements of this section and section 199A are satisfied (including, for example, the exclusion of income not effectively connected with a United States trade or business).
(i)
Section 751 gain.
With respect to a partnership, if section 751(a) or (b) applies, then gain or loss attributable to assets of the partnership giving rise to ordinary income under section 751(a) or (b) is considered attributable to the trades or businesses conducted by the partnership, and is taken into account for purposes of computing QBI.
(ii)
Guaranteed payments for the use of capital.
Income attributable to a guaranteed payment for the use of capital is not considered to be attributable to a trade or business, and thus is not taken into account for purposes of computing QBI except to the extent properly allocable to a trade or business of the recipient. The partnership's deduction associated with the guaranteed payment will be taken into account for purposes of computing QBI if such deduction is properly allocable to the trade or business and is otherwise deductible for Federal income tax purposes.
(iii)
Section 481 adjustments.
Section 481 adjustments (whether positive or negative) are taken into account for purposes of computing QBI to the extent that the requirements of this section and section 199A are otherwise satisfied, but only if the adjustment arises in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017.
(iv)
Previously disallowed losses
—(A)
In general.
Previously disallowed losses or deductions allowed in the taxable year generally are taken into account for purposes of computing QBI to the extent the disallowed loss or deduction is otherwise allowed by section 199A. These previously disallowed losses include, but are not limited to losses disallowed under sections 461(l), 465, 469, 704(d), and 1366(d). These losses are used for purposes of section 199A and this section in order from the oldest to the most recent on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and are treated as losses from a separate trade or business. To the extent such losses relate to a PTP, they must be treated as a loss from a separate PTP in the taxable year the losses are taken into account. However, losses or deductions that were disallowed, suspended, limited, or carried over from taxable years ending before January 1, 2018 (including under sections 465, 469, 704(d), and 1366(d)), are not taken into account in a subsequent taxable year for purposes of computing QBI.
(B)
Partial allowance.
If a loss or deduction attributable to a trade or business is only partially allowed during the taxable year in which incurred, only the portion of the allowed loss or deduction that is attributable to QBI will be considered in determining QBI from the trade or business in the year the loss or deduction is incurred. The portion of the allowed loss or deduction attributable to QBI is determined by
multiplying the total amount of the allowed loss by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the total loss incurred during the taxable year that is attributable to QBI and the denominator of which is the amount of the total loss incurred during the taxable year.
(C)
Attributes of disallowed loss or deduction determined in year loss is incurred
—(
1
)
In general.
Whether a disallowed loss or deduction is attributable to a trade or business, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, is determined in the year the loss is incurred.
(
2
)
Specified service trades or businesses.
If a disallowed loss or deduction is attributable to a specified service trade or business (SSTB), whether an individual has taxable income at or below the threshold amount as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(12), within the phase-in range as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(4), or in excess of the phase-in range is determined in the year the loss or deduction is incurred. If the individual's taxable income is at or below the threshold amount in the year the loss or deduction is incurred, the entire disallowed loss or deduction must be taken into account when applying paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. If the individual's taxable income is within the phase-in range, then only the applicable percentage, as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(2), of the disallowed loss or deduction is taken into account when applying paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. If the individual's taxable income exceeds the phase-in range, none of the disallowed loss or deduction will be taken into account in applying paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv).
(
1
)
Example 1.
A is an unmarried individual and a 50% owner of LLC, an entity classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. In 2018, A's allocable share of loss from LLC is $100,000 of which $80,000 is negative QBI. Under section 465, $60,000 of the allocable loss is allowed in determining A's taxable income. A has no other previously disallowed losses under section 465 or any other provision of the Code for 2018 or prior years. Because 80% of A's allocable loss is attributable to QBI ($80,000/$100,000), A will reduce the amount A takes into account in determining QBI proportionately. Thus, A will include $48,000 of the allowed loss in negative QBI (80% of $60,000) in determining A's section 199A deduction in 2018. The remaining $32,000 of negative QBI is treated as negative QBI from a separate trade or business for purposes of computing the section 199A deduction in the year the loss is taken into account in determining taxable income as described in § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iii).
(
2
)
Example 2.
B is an unmarried individual and a 50% owner of LLC, an entity classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. After allowable deductions other than the section 199A deduction, B's taxable income for 2018 is $177,500. In 2018, LLC has a single trade or business that is an SSTB. B's allocable share of loss is $100,000, all of which is suspended under section 465. B's allocable share of negative QBI is also $100,000. B has no other previously disallowed losses under section 465 or any other provision of the Code for 2018 or prior years. Because the entire loss is suspended, none of the negative QBI is taken into account in determining B's section 199A deduction for 2018. Further, because the negative QBI is from an SSTB and B's taxable income before the section 199A deduction is within the phase-in range, B must determine the applicable percentage of the negative QBI that must be taken into account in the year that the loss is taken into account in determining taxable income. B's applicable percentage is 100% reduced by 40% (the percentage equal to the amount that B's taxable income for the taxable year exceeds B's threshold amount ($20,000 = $177,500−$157,500) over $50,000). Thus, B's applicable percentage is 60%. Therefore, B will have $60,000 (60% of $100,000) of negative QBI from a separate trade or business to be applied proportionately to QBI in the year(s) the loss is taken into account in determining taxable income, regardless of the amount of taxable income and how rules under § 1.199A-5 apply in the year the loss is taken into account in determining taxable income.
(v)
Net operating losses.
Generally, a net operating loss deduction under section 172 is not considered with respect to a trade or business and therefore, is not taken into account in computing QBI. However, an excess business loss under section 461(l) is treated as a net operating loss carryover to the following taxable year and is taken into account for purposes of computing QBI in the subsequent taxable year in which it is deducted.
(vi)
Other deductions.
Generally, deductions attributable to a trade or business are taken into account for purposes of computing QBI to the extent that the requirements of section
199A and this section are otherwise satisfied. For purposes of section 199A only, deductions such as the deductible portion of the tax on self-employment income under section 164(f), the self-employed health insurance deduction under section 162(l), and the deduction for contributions to qualified retirement plans under section 404 are considered attributable to a trade or business to the extent that the individual's gross income from the trade or business is taken into account in calculating the allowable deduction, on a proportionate basis to the gross income received from the trade or business.
(2)
Qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss
—(i)
In general.
The term
qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss
means items of gross income, gain, deduction, and loss to the extent such items are—
(A) Effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (within the meaning of section 864(c), determined by substituting “trade or business (within the meaning of section 199A)” for “nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation” or for “a foreign corporation” each place it appears); and
(B) Included or allowed in determining taxable income for the taxable year.
(ii)
Items not taken into account.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and in accordance with section 199A(c)(3)(B) and (c)(4), the following items are not taken into account as qualified items of income, gain, deduction, or loss and thus are not included in determining QBI:
(A) Any item of short-term capital gain, short-term capital loss, long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss, including any item treated as one of such items under any other provision of the Code. This provision does not apply to the extent an item is treated as anything other than short-term capital gain, short-term capital loss, long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.
(B) Any dividend, income equivalent to a dividend, or payment in lieu of dividends described in section 954(c)(1)(G). Any amount described in section 1385(a)(1) is not treated as described in this clause.
(C) Any interest income other than interest income which is properly allocable to a trade or business. For purposes of section 199A and this section, interest income attributable to an investment of working capital, reserves, or similar accounts is not properly allocable to a trade or business.
(D) Any item of gain or loss described in section 954(c)(1)(C) (transactions in commodities) or section 954(c)(1)(D) (excess foreign currency gains) applied in each case by substituting “trade or business (within the meaning of section 199A)” for “controlled foreign corporation.”
(E) Any item of income, gain, deduction, or loss described in section 954(c)(1)(F) (income from notional principal contracts) determined without regard to section 954(c)(1)(F)(ii) and other than items attributable to notional principal contracts entered into in transactions qualifying under section 1221(a)(7).
(F) Any amount received from an annuity which is not received in connection with the trade or business.
(G) Any qualified REIT dividends as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or qualified PTP income as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(H) Reasonable compensation received by a shareholder from an S corporation. However, the S corporation's deduction for such reasonable compensation will reduce QBI if such deduction is properly allocable to the trade or business and is otherwise deductible for Federal income tax purposes.
(I) Any guaranteed payment described in section 707(c) received by a partner for services rendered with respect to the trade or business, regardless of whether the partner is an individual or an RPE. However, the partnership's deduction for such guaranteed payment will reduce QBI if such deduction is properly allocable to the trade or business and is otherwise deductible for Federal income tax purposes.
(J) Any payment described in section 707(a) received by a partner for services rendered with respect to the trade or business, regardless of whether the partner is an individual or an RPE. However, the partnership's deduction
for such payment will reduce QBI if such deduction is properly allocable to the trade or business and is otherwise deductible for Federal income tax purposes.
(3)
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
For the purposes of determining QBI, the term
United States
includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the case of any taxpayer with QBI for any taxable year from sources within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, if all of such receipts are taxable under section 1 for such taxable year. This paragraph (b)(3) only applies as provided in section 199A(f)(1)(C).
(4)
Wages.
Expenses for all wages paid (or incurred in the case of an accrual method taxpayer) must be taken into account in computing QBI (if the requirements of this section and section 199A are satisfied) regardless of the application of the W-2 wage limitation described in § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iv).
(5)
Allocation of items among directly-conducted trades or businesses.
If an individual or an RPE directly conducts multiple trades or businesses, and has items of QBI that are properly attributable to more than one trade or business, the individual or RPE must allocate those items among the several trades or businesses to which they are attributable using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances. The individual or RPE may use a different reasonable method with respect to different items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. The chosen reasonable method for each item must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the income and expenses of each trade or business. The overall combination of methods must also be reasonable based on all facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for a trade or business must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (b)(5).
(c)
Qualified REIT Dividends and Qualified PTP Income
—(1)
In general.
Qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income are the sum of qualified REIT dividends as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section earned directly or through an RPE and the net amount of qualified PTP income as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section earned directly or through an RPE.
(2)
Qualified REIT dividend
—(i) The term
qualified REIT dividend
means any dividend from a REIT received during the taxable year which—
(A) Is not a capital gain dividend, as defined in section 857(b)(3); and
(B) Is not qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11).
(ii) The term qualified REIT dividend does not include any REIT dividend received with respect to any share of REIT stock—
(A) That is held by the shareholder for 45 days or less (taking into account the principles of section 246(c)(3) and (4)) during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend; or
(B) To the extent that the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.
(3)
Qualified PTP income
—(i)
In general.
The term
qualified PTP income
means the sum of—
(A) The net amount of such taxpayer's allocable share of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a PTP as defined in section 7704(b) that is not taxed as a corporation under section 7704(a); plus
(B) Any gain or loss attributable to assets of the PTP giving rise to ordinary income under section 751(a) or (b) that is considered attributable to the trades or businesses conducted by the partnership.
(ii)
Special rules.
The rules applicable to the determination of QBI described in paragraph (b) of this section also apply to the determination of a taxpayer's allocable share of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a PTP. An individual's allocable share of income from a PTP, and any section 751 gain or loss is qualified PTP income only to the extent the items meet the qualifications of section 199A and this section, including the requirement that the item is included or allowed in determining taxable income for the taxable year, and the requirement that the item be effectively connected with
the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. For example, if an individual owns an interest in a PTP, and for the taxable year is allocated a distributive share of net loss which is disallowed under the passive activity rules of section 469, such loss is not taken into account for purposes of section 199A. The specified service trade or business limitations described in §§ 1.199A-1(d)(3) and 1.199A-5 also apply to income earned from a PTP. Furthermore, each PTP is required to determine its qualified PTP income for each trade or business and report that information to its owners as described in § 1.199A-6(b)(3).
(d)
Section 199A dividends paid by a regulated investment company
—(1)
In general.
If section 852(b) applies to a regulated investment company (RIC) for a taxable year, the RIC may pay section 199A dividends, as defined in this paragraph (d).
(2)
Definition of section 199A dividend
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a section 199A dividend is any dividend or part of such a dividend that a RIC pays to its shareholders and reports as a section 199A dividend in written statements furnished to its shareholders.
(ii)
Reduction in the case of excess reported amounts.
If the aggregate reported amount with respect to the RIC for any taxable year exceeds the RIC's qualified REIT dividend income for the taxable year, then a section 199A dividend is equal to—
(A) The reported section 199A dividend amount; reduced by
(B) The excess reported amount that is allocable to that reported section 199A dividend amount.
(iii)
Allocation of excess reported amount
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the excess reported amount (if any) that is allocable to the reported section 199A dividend amount is that portion of the excess reported amount that bears the same ratio to the excess reported amount as the reported section 199A dividend amount bears to the aggregate reported amount.
(B)
Special rule for noncalendar-year RICs.
In the case of any taxable year that does not begin and end in the same calendar year, if the post-December reported amount equals or exceeds the excess reported amount for that taxable year, paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is applied by substituting “post-December reported amount” for “aggregate reported amount,” and no excess reported amount is allocated to any dividend paid on or before December 31 of that taxable year.
(3)
Definitions.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section—
(i)
Reported section 199A dividend amount.
The term
reported section 199A dividend amount
means the amount of a dividend distribution reported to the RIC's shareholders under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section as a section 199A dividend.
(ii)
Excess reported amount.
The term
excess reported amount
means the excess of the aggregate reported amount over the RIC's qualified REIT dividend income for the taxable year.
(iii)
Aggregate reported amount.
The term

means the aggregate amount of dividends reported by the RIC under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section as section 199A dividends for the taxable year (including section 199A dividends paid after the close of the taxable year and described in section 855).
(iv)
Post-December reported amount.
The term
post-December reported amount
means the aggregate reported amount determined by taking into account only dividends paid after December 31 of the taxable year.
(v)
Qualified REIT dividend income.
The term
qualified REIT dividend income
means, with respect to a taxable year of a RIC, the excess of the amount of qualified REIT dividends, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, includible in the RIC's taxable income for the taxable year over the amount of the RIC's deductions that are properly allocable to such income.
(4)
Treatment of section 199A dividends by shareholders
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 199A, and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6, a section 199A dividend is treated by a taxpayer that receives the section 199A dividend as a qualified REIT dividend.
(ii)
Holding period.
Paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to any
dividend received with respect to a share of RIC stock—
(A) That is held by the shareholder for 45 days or less (taking into account the principles of section 246(c)(3) and (4)) during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which the share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend; or
(B) To the extent that the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (d).
(i) X is a corporation that has elected to be a RIC. For its taxable year ending March 31, 2021, X has $25,000x of net long-term capital gain, $60,000x of qualified dividend income, $25,000x of taxable interest income, $15,000x of net short-term capital gain, and $25,000x of qualified REIT dividends. X has $15,000x of deductible expenses, of which $3,000x is allocable to the qualified REIT dividends. On December 31, 2020, X pays a single dividend of $100,000x, and reports $20,000x of the dividend as a section 199A dividend in written statements to its shareholders. On March 31, 2021, X pays a dividend of $35,000x, and reports $5,000x of the dividend as a section 199A dividend in written statements to its shareholders.
(ii) X's qualified REIT dividend income under paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section is $22,000x, which is the excess of X's $25,000x of qualified REIT dividends over $3,000x in allocable expenses. The reported section 199A dividend amounts for the December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, distributions are $20,000x and $5,000x, respectively. For the taxable year ending March 31, 2021, the aggregate reported amount of section 199A dividends is $25,000x, and the excess reported amount under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section is $3,000x. Because X is a noncalendar-year RIC and the post-December reported amount of $5,000x exceeds the excess reported amount of $3,000x, the entire excess reported amount is allocated under paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section to the reported section 199A dividend amount for the March 31, 2021, distribution. No portion of the excess reported amount is allocated to the reported section 199A dividend amount for the December 31, 2020, distribution. Thus, the section 199A dividend on March 31, 2021, is $2,000x, which is the reported section 199A dividend amount of $5,000x reduced by the $3,000x of allocable excess reported amount. The section 199A dividend on December 31, 2020, is the $20,000x that X reports as a section 199A dividend.
(iii) Shareholder A, a United States person, receives a dividend from X of $100x on December 31, 2020, of which $20x is reported as a section 199A dividend. If A meets the holding period requirements in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section with respect to the stock of X, A treats $20x of the dividend from X as a qualified REIT dividend for purposes of section 199A for A's 2020 taxable year.
(iv) A receives a dividend from X of $35x on March 31, 2021, of which $5x is reported as a section 199A dividend. Only $2x of the dividend is a section 199A dividend. If A meets the holding period requirements in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section with respect to the stock of X, A may treat the $2x section 199A dividend as a qualified REIT dividend for A's 2021 taxable year.
(e)
Applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section apply to taxable years ending after February 8, 2019.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Anti-abuse rules.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section apply to taxable years ending after December 22, 2017.
(ii)
Non-calendar year RPE.
For purposes of determining QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income if an individual receives any of these items from an RPE with a taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018, and ends after December 31, 2017, such items are treated as having been incurred by the individual during the individual's taxable year in which or with which such RPE taxable year ends.
(iii)
Previously disallowed losses.
The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section apply to taxable years beginning after August 24, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section for taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 2020, so long as the taxpayers consistently apply the rules in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section for each such year.
(iv)
Section 199A dividends.
The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply to taxable years beginning after August 24, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in paragraph (d) of this section for taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 2020, so long as the taxpayers consistently apply the
rules in paragraph (d) of this section for each such year.
[T.D. 9847, 84 FR 3000, Feb. 8, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9899, 85 FR 38065, June 25, 2020]
§ 1.199A-4
Aggregation.
(a)
Scope and purpose.
An individual or RPE may be engaged in more than one trade or business. Except as provided in this section, each trade or business is a separate trade or business for purposes of applying the limitations described in § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iv). This section sets forth rules to allow individuals and RPEs to aggregate trades or businesses, treating the aggregate as a single trade or business for purposes of applying the limitations described in § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iv). Trades or businesses may be aggregated only to the extent provided in this section, but aggregation by taxpayers is not required.
(b)
Aggregation rules
—(1)
General rule.
Trades or businesses may be aggregated only if an individual or RPE can demonstrate that—
(i) The same person or group of persons, directly or by attribution under sections 267(b) or 707(b), owns 50 percent or more of each trade or business to be aggregated, meaning in the case of such trades or businesses owned by an S corporation, 50 percent or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation, or, in the case of such trades or businesses owned by a partnership, 50 percent or more of the capital or profits in the partnership;
(ii) The ownership described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section exists for a majority of the taxable year, including the last day of the taxable year, in which the items attributable to each trade or business to be aggregated are included in income;
(iii) All of the items attributable to each trade or business to be aggregated are reported on returns with the same taxable year, not taking into account short taxable years;
(iv) None of the trades or businesses to be aggregated is a
specified service trade or business
(SSTB) as defined in § 1.199A-5; and
(v) The trades or businesses to be aggregated satisfy at least two of the following factors (based on all of the facts and circumstances):
(A) The trades or businesses provide products, property, or services that are the same or customarily offered together.
(B) The trades or businesses share facilities or share significant centralized business elements, such as personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, or information technology resources.
(C) The trades or businesses are operated in coordination with, or reliance upon, one or more of the businesses in the aggregated group (for example, supply chain interdependencies).
(2)
Operating rules
—(i)
Individuals.
An individual may aggregate trades or businesses operated directly or through an RPE to the extent an aggregation is not inconsistent with the aggregation of an RPE. If an individual aggregates multiple trades or businesses under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property must be combined for the aggregated trades or businesses for purposes of applying the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations described in § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iv). An individual may not subtract from the trades or businesses aggregated by an RPE but may aggregate additional trades or businesses with the RPE's aggregation if the rules of this section are otherwise satisfied.
(ii)
RPEs.
An RPE may aggregate trades or businesses operated directly or through a lower-tier RPE to the extent an aggregation is not inconsistent with the aggregation of a lower-tier RPE. If an RPE itself does not aggregate, multiple owners of an RPE need not aggregate in the same manner. If an RPE aggregates multiple trades or businesses under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the RPE must compute and report QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property for the aggregated trade or business under the rules described in § 1.199A-6(b). An RPE may not subtract from the trades or businesses aggregated by a lower-tier RPE but may aggregate additional trades or businesses with a lower-tier RPE's aggregation if the rules of this section are otherwise satisfied.
(c)
Reporting and consistency requirements
—(1)
Individuals.
Once an individual chooses to aggregate two or
more trades or businesses, the individual must consistently report the aggregated trades or businesses in all subsequent taxable years. A failure to aggregate will not be considered to be an aggregation for purposes of this rule. An individual that fails to aggregate may not aggregate trades or businesses on an amended return (other than an amended return for the 2018 taxable year). However, an individual may add a newly created or newly acquired (including through non-recognition transfers) trade or business to an existing aggregated trade or business (including the aggregated trade or business of an RPE) if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied. In a subsequent year, if there is a significant change in facts and circumstances such that an individual's prior aggregation of trades or businesses no longer qualifies for aggregation under the rules of this section, then the trades or businesses will no longer be aggregated within the meaning of this section, and the individual must reapply the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine a new permissible aggregation (if any). An individual also must report aggregated trades or businesses of an RPE in which the individual holds a direct or indirect interest.
(2)
Individual disclosure
—(i)
Required annual disclosure.
For each taxable year, individuals must attach a statement to their returns identifying each trade or business aggregated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The statement must contain—
(A) A description of each trade or business;
(B) The name and EIN of each entity in which a trade or business is operated;
(C) Information identifying any trade or business that was formed, ceased operations, was acquired, or was disposed of during the taxable year;
(D) Information identifying any aggregated trade or business of an RPE in which the individual holds an ownership interest; and
(E) Such other information as the Commissioner may require in forms, instructions, or other published guidance.
(ii)
Failure to disclose.
If an individual fails to attach the statement required in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the Commissioner may disaggregate the individual's trades or businesses. The individual may not aggregate trades or businesses that are disaggregated by the Commissioner for the subsequent three taxable years.
(3)
RPEs.
Once an RPE chooses to aggregate two or more trades or businesses, the RPE must consistently report the aggregated trades or businesses in all subsequent taxable years. A failure to aggregate will not be considered to be an aggregation for purposes of this rule. An RPE that fails to aggregate may not aggregate trades or businesses on an amended return (other than an amended return for the 2018 taxable year). However, an RPE may add a newly created or newly acquired (including through non-recognition transfers) trade or business to an existing aggregated trade or business (including the aggregated trade or business of a lower-tier RPE) if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied.In a subsequent year, if there is a significant change in facts and circumstances such that an RPE's prior aggregation of trades or businesses no longer qualifies for aggregation under the rules of this section, then the trades or businesses will no longer be aggregated within the meaning of this section, and the RPE must reapply the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine a new permissible aggregation (if any). An RPE also must report aggregated trades or businesses of a lower-tier RPE in which the RPE holds a direct or indirect interest.
(4)
RPE disclosure
—(i)
Required annual disclosure.
For each taxable year, RPEs (including each RPE in a tiered structure) must attach a statement to each owner's Schedule K-1 identifying each trade or business aggregated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The statement must contain—
(A) A description of each trade or business;
(B) The name and EIN of each entity in which a trade or business is operated;
(C) Information identifying any trade or business that was formed, ceased operations, was acquired, or was disposed of during the taxable year;
(D) Information identifying any aggregated trade or business of an RPE in which the RPE holds an ownership interest; and
(E) Such other information as the Commissioner may require in forms, instructions, or other published guidance.
(ii)
Failure to disclose.
If an RPE fails to attach the statement required in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the Commissioner may disaggregate the RPE's trades or businesses.The RPE may not aggregate trades or businesses that are disaggregated by the Commissioner for the subsequent three taxable years.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, all individuals and RPEs use a calendar taxable year, there are no ownership changes during the taxable year, all trades or businesses satisfy the requirements under section 162, all tax items are effectively connected to a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of section 864(c), and none of the trades or businesses is an SSTB within the meaning of § 1.199A-5. Except as otherwise specified, a single capital letter denotes an individual taxpayer.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
A wholly owns and operates a catering business and a restaurant through separate disregarded entities. The catering business and the restaurant share centralized purchasing to obtain volume discounts and a centralized accounting office that performs all of the bookkeeping, tracks and issues statements on all of the receivables, and prepares the payroll for each business. A maintains a website and print advertising materials that reference both the catering business and the restaurant. A uses the restaurant kitchen to prepare food for the catering business. The catering business employs its own staff and owns equipment and trucks that are not used or associated with the restaurant.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the restaurant and catering business are held in disregarded entities, A will be treated as operating each of these businesses directly and thereby satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, A satisfies the following factors: Paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section is met as both businesses offer prepared food to customers; and paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section is met because the two businesses share the same kitchen facilities in addition to centralized purchasing, marketing, and accounting. Having satisfied paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, A may treat the catering business and the restaurant as a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but the catering and restaurant businesses are owned in separate partnerships and A, B, C, and D each own a 25% interest in each of the two partnerships. A, B, C, and D are unrelated.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section A, B, C, and D together own more than 50% of each of the two partnerships, they may each treat the catering business and the restaurant as a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
W owns a 75% interest in S1, an S corporation, and a 75% interest in PRS, a partnership. S1 manufactures clothing and PRS is a retail pet food store. W manages S1 and PRS.
(ii)
Analysis.
W owns more than 50% of the stock of S1 and more than 50% of PRS thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Although W manages both S1 and PRS, W is not able to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section as the two businesses do not provide goods or services that are the same or customarily offered together; there are no significant centralized business elements; and no facts indicate that the businesses are operated in coordination with, or reliance upon, one another. W must treat S1 and PRS as separate trades or businesses for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(4)
Example 4
—(i)
Facts.
E owns a 60% interest in each of four partnerships (PRS1, PRS2, PRS3, and PRS4). Each partnership operates a hardware store. A team of executives oversees the operations of all four of the businesses and controls the policy decisions involving the business as a whole. Human resources and accounting are centralized for the four businesses. E reports PRS1, PRS3, and PRS4 as an aggregated trade or business under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and reports PRS2 as a separate trade or business. Only PRS2 generates a net taxable loss.
(ii)
Analysis.
E owns more than 50% of each partnership thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the following factors are satisfied: Paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section because each partnership operates a hardware store; and paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section because the businesses share accounting and human resource functions. E's decision to aggregate only PRS1, PRS3, and PRS4 into a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d) is permissible. The loss from PRS2 will be netted against the aggregate profits of PRS1, PRS3, and PRS4 pursuant to § 1.199A-1(d)(2)(iii).
(5)
Example 5
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as
Example 4
of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and that F owns a 10% interest in PRS1, PRS2, PRS3, and PRS4.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section E owns more than 50% of the four partnerships, F may aggregate PRS 1, PRS2, PRS3, and PRS4 as a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d), provided that F can demonstrate that the ownership test is met by E.
(6)
Example 6
—(i)
Facts.
D owns 75% of the stock of S1, S2, and S3, each of which is an S corporation. Each S corporation operates a grocery store in a separate state. S1 and S2 share centralized purchasing functions to obtain volume discounts and a centralized accounting office that performs all of the bookkeeping, tracks and issues statements on all of the receivables, and prepares the payroll for each business. S3 is operated independently from the other businesses.
(ii)
Analysis.
D owns more than 50% of the stock of each S corporation thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the grocery stores satisfy paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section because they are in the same trade or business. Only S1 and S2 satisfy paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section because of their centralized purchasing and accounting offices. D is only able to show that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section are satisfied for S1 and S2; therefore, D only may aggregate S1 and S2 into a single trade or business for purposes of § 1.199A-1(d). D must report S3 as a separate trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(7)
Example 7
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as
Example 6
of paragraph (d)(6) of this section except each store is independently operated and S1 and S2 do not have centralized purchasing or accounting functions.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although the stores provide the same products and services within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section, D cannot show that another factor under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is present. Therefore, D must report S1, S2, and S3 as separate trades or businesses for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(8)
Example 8
—(i)
Facts.
G owns 80% of the stock in S1, an S corporation and 80% of LLC1 and LLC2, each of which is a partnership for Federal tax purposes. LLC1 manufactures and supplies all of the widgets sold by LLC2. LLC2 operates a retail store that sells LLC1's widgets. S1 owns the real property leased to LLC1 and LLC2 for use by the factory and retail store. The entities share common advertising and management.
(ii)
Analysis.
G owns more than 50% of the stock of S1 and more than 50% of LLC1 and LLC2 thus satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. LLC1, LLC2, and S1 share significant centralized business elements and are operated in coordination with, or in reliance upon, one or more of the businesses in the aggregated group. G can treat the business operations of LLC1
and LLC2 as a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d). S1 is eligible to be included in the aggregated group because it leases property to a trade or business within the aggregated trade or business as described in § 1.199A-1(b)(14) and meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(9)
Example 9
—(i)
Facts.
Same facts as
Example 8
of paragraph (d)(8) of this section, except G owns 80% of the stock in S1 and 20% of each of LLC1 and LLC2. B, G's son, owns a majority interest in LLC2, and M, G's mother, owns a majority interest in LLC1. B does not own an interest in S1 or LLC1, and M does not own an interest in S1 or LLC2.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, B and M's interest in LLC2 and LLC1, respectively, are attributable to G and G is treated as owning a majority interest in LLC2 and LLC1; G thus satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. G may aggregate his interests in LLC1, LLC2, and S1 as a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S1 is eligible to be included in the aggregated group because it leases property to a trade or business within the aggregated trade or business as described in § 1.199A-1(b)(14) and meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(10)
Example 10
—(i)
Facts.
F owns a 75% interest and G owns a 5% interest in five partnerships (PRS1-PRS5). H owns a 10% interest in PRS1 and PRS2. Each partnership operates a restaurant and each restaurant separately constitutes a trade or business for purposes of section 162. G is the executive chef of all of the restaurants and as such he creates the menus and orders the food supplies.
(ii)
Analysis.
F owns more than 50% of the partnerships thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the restaurants satisfy paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A) of this section because they are in the same trade or business, and paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section is satisfied as G is the executive chef of all of the restaurants and the businesses share a centralized function for ordering food and supplies. F can show the requirements under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied as to all of the restaurants. Because F owns a majority interest in each of the partnerships, G can demonstrate that paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is satisfied. G can also aggregate all five restaurants into a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d). H, however, only owns an interest in PRS1 and PRS2. Like G, H satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section because F owns a majority interest. H can, therefore, aggregate PRS1 and PRS2 into a single trade or business for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(11)
Example 11
—(i)
Facts.
H, J, K, and L own interests in PRS1 and PRS2, each a partnership, and S1 and S2, each an S corporation. H, J, K, and L also own interests in C, an entity taxable as a C corporation. H owns 30%, J owns 20%, K owns 5%, and L owns 45% of each of the five entities. All of the entities satisfy 2 of the 3 factors under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. For purposes of section 199A the taxpayers report the following aggregated trades or businesses: H aggregates PRS1 and S1 together and aggregates PRS2 and S2 together; J aggregates PRS1, S1 and S2 together and reports PRS2 separately; K aggregates PRS1 and PRS2 together and aggregates S1 and S2 together; and L aggregates S1, S2, and PRS2 together and reports PRS1 separately. C cannot be aggregated.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because H, J, and K together own a majority interest in PRS1, PRS2, S1, and S2, H, J, K, and L are permitted to aggregate under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Further, the aggregations reported by the taxpayers are permitted, but not required for each of H, J, K, and L. C's income is not eligible for the section 199A deduction and it cannot be aggregated for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(12)
Example 12
—(i)
Facts.
L owns 60% of PRS1, a partnership, a business that sells non-food items to grocery stores. L also owns 55% of PRS2, a partnership, which owns and operates a distribution trucking business. The predominant portion of PRS2's business is transporting goods for PRS1.
(ii)
Analysis.
L is able to meet paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as the majority owner of PRS1 and PRS2. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, L is only able to show the operations of PRS1 and PRS2 are operated in reliance of one another under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(C) of this section. For purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d), L must treat PRS1 and PRS2 as separate trades or businesses.
(13)
Example 13
—(i)
Facts.
C owns a majority interest in a sailboat racing team and also owns an interest in PRS1 which operates a marina. PRS1 is a trade or business under section 162, but the sailboat racing team is not a trade or business within the meaning of section 162.
(ii)
Analysis.
C has only one trade or business for purposes of section 199A and, therefore, cannot aggregate the interest in the racing team with PRS1 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(14)
Example 14
—(i)
Facts.
Trust wholly owns LLC1, LLC2, and LLC3. LLC1 operates a trucking company that delivers lumber and other supplies sold by LLC2. LLC2 operates a lumber yard and supplies LLC3 with building materials. LLC3 operates a construction business. LLC1, LLC2, and LLC3 have a centralized human resources department, payroll, and accounting department.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because Trust owns 100% of the interests in LLC1, LLC2, and LLC3, Trust satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Trust can also show that it satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section as the trades or businesses have a centralized human resources department, payroll, and accounting department. Trust also can show is meets paragraph (b)(1)(v)(C) of this section as the trades or businesses are operated in coordination, or reliance upon, one or more in the aggregated group. Trust can aggregate LLC1, LLC2, and LLC3 for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(15)
Example 15
—(i)
Facts.
PRS1, a partnership, directly operates a food service trade or business and owns 60% of PRS2, which directly operates a movie theater trade or business and a food service trade or business. PRS2's movie theater and food service businesses operate in coordination with, or reliance upon, one another and share a centralized human resources department, payroll, and accounting department. PRS1's and PRS2's food service businesses provide products and services that are the same and share centralized purchasing and shipping to obtain volume discounts.
(ii)
Analysis.
PRS2 may aggregate its movie theater and food service businesses. Paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is satisfied because the businesses operate in coordination with one another and share centralized business elements. If PRS2 does aggregate the two businesses, PRS1 may not aggregate its food service business with PRS2's aggregated trades or businesses.Because PRS1 owns more than 50% of PRS2, thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, PRS1 may aggregate its food service businesses with PRS2's food service business if PRS2 has not aggregated its movie theater and food service businesses. Paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is satisfied because the businesses provide the same products and services and share centralized business elements. Under either alternative, PRS1's food service business and PRS2's movie theater cannot be aggregated because there are no factors in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section present between the businesses.
(16)
Example 16
—(i)
Facts.
PRS1, a partnership, owns 60% of a commercial rental office building in state A, and 80% of a commercial rental office building in state B. Both commercial rental office building operations share centralized accounting, legal, and human resource functions. PRS1 treats the two commercial rental office buildings as an aggregated trade or business under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
PRS1 owns more than 50% of each trade or business thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, PRS1 may aggregate its commercial rental office buildings because the businesses provide the same type of property and share accounting, legal, and human resource functions.
(17)
Example 17
—(i)
Facts.
S, an S corporation owns 100% of the interests in a residential condominium building
and 100% of the interests in a commercial rental office building. Both building operations share centralized accounting, legal, and human resource functions.
(ii)
Analysis.
S owns more than 50% of each trade or business thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Although both businesses share significant centralized business elements, S cannot show that another factor under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is present because the two building operations are not of the same type of property. S must treat the residential condominium building and the commercial rental office building as separate trades or businesses for purposes of applying § 1.199A-1(d).
(18)
Example 18
—(i)
Facts.
M owns 75% of a residential apartment building. M also owns 80% of PRS2. PRS2 owns 80% of the interests in a residential condominium building and 80% of the interests in a residential apartment building. PRS2's residential condominium building and residential apartment building operations share centralized back office functions and management. M's residential apartment building and PRS2's residential condominium and apartment building operate in coordination with each other in renting apartments to tenants.
(ii)
Analysis.
PRS2 may aggregate its residential condominium and residential apartment building operations. PRS2 owns more than 50% of each trade or business thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is satisfied because the businesses are of the same type of property and share centralized back office functions and management. M may also add its residential apartment building operations to PRS2's aggregated residential condominium and apartment building operations. M owns more than 50% of each trade or business thereby satisfying paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is also satisfied because the businesses operate in coordination with each other.
(e)
Applicability date
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section apply to taxable years ending after February 8, 2019.
(2)
Exception for non-calendar year RPE.
For purposes of determining QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income, if an individual receives any of these items from an RPE with a taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018, and ends after December 31, 2017, such items are treated as having been incurred by the individual during the individual's taxable year in which or with which such RPE taxable year ends.
[T.D. 9847, 84 FR 3002, Feb. 8, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9847, 84 FR 15955, Apr. 17, 2019]
§ 1.199A-5
Specified service trades or businesses and the trade or business of performing services as an employee.
(a)
Scope and effect
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides guidance on specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs) and the trade or business of performing services as an employee. This paragraph (a) describes the effect of a trade or business being an SSTB and the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitional guidance on SSTBs. Paragraph (c) of this section provides special rules related to SSTBs. Paragraph (d) of this section provides guidance on the trade or business of performing services as an employee. The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
(2)
Effect of being an SSTB.
If a trade or business is an SSTB, no qualified business income (QBI), W-2 wages, or unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property from the SSTB may be taken into account by any individual whose taxable income exceeds the phase-in range as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(4), even if the item is derived from an activity that is not itself a specified service activity. The SSTB limitation also applies to income earned from a publicly traded partnership (PTP). If a trade or business conducted by a relevant passthrough entity (RPE) or PTP is an SSTB, this limitation applies to any
direct or indirect individual owners of the business, regardless of whether the owner is passive or participated in any specified service activity. However, the SSTB limitation does not apply to individuals with taxable income below the threshold amount as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(12). A phase-in rule, provided in § 1.199A-1(d)(2), applies to individuals with taxable income within the phase-in range, allowing them to take into account a certain “applicable percentage” of QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property from an SSTB. The phase-in rule also applies to income earned from a PTP. A direct or indirect owner of a trade or business engaged in the performance of a specified service is engaged in the performance of the specified service for purposes of section 199A and this section, regardless of whether the owner is passive or participated in the specified service activity.
(3)
Trade or business of performing services as an employee.
The trade or business of performing services as an employee is not a trade or business for purposes of section 199A and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, no items of income, gain, deduction, or loss from the trade or business of performing services as an employee constitute QBI within the meaning of section 199A and § 1.199A-3. No taxpayer may claim a section 199A deduction for wage income, regardless of the amount of taxable income.
(b)
Definition of specified service trade or business.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the term
specified service trade or business (SSTB)
means any of the following:
(1)
Listed SSTBs.
Any trade or business involving the performance of services in one or more of the following fields:
(i)
Health
as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section;
(ii)
Law
as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section;
(iii)
Accounting
as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section;
(iv)

Special rules
—(1)
De minimis rule
—(i)
Gross receipts of $25 million or less.

(ii)
Gross receipts of greater than $25 million.
For a trade or business with gross receipts of greater than $25 million for the taxable year, the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are applied by substituting “5 percent” for “10 percent” each place it appears.

(ii)
50 percent or more common ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, 50 percent or more common ownership includes direct or indirect ownership by related parties within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b).
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
Law Firm is a partnership that provides legal services to clients, owns its own office building and employs its own administrative staff. Law Firm divides into three partnerships. Partnership 1 performs legal services to clients. Partnership 2 owns the office building and rents the entire building to Partnership 1. Partnership 3 employs the administrative staff and through a contract with Partnership 1 provides administrative services to Partnership 1 in exchange for fees. All three of the partnerships are owned by the same people (the original owners of Law Firm). Because Partnership 2 provides all of its property to Partnership 1, and Partnership 3 provides all of its services to Partnership 1, Partnerships 2 and 3 will each be treated as an SSTB under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(B)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of this paragraph (c)(2), except that Partnership 2, which owns the office building, rents 50 percent of the building to Partnership 1, which provides legal services, and the other 50 percent to various unrelated third party tenants. Because Partnership 2 is owned by the same people as Partnership 1, the portion of Partnership 2's leasing activity related to the lease of the building to Partnership 1 will be treated as a separate SSTB. The remaining 50 percent of Partnership 2's
leasing activity will not be treated as an SSTB.
(d)
Trade or business of performing services as an employee
—(1)
In general.
The trade or business of performing services as an employee is not a trade or business for purposes of section 199A and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, no items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from the trade or business of performing services as an employee constitute QBI within the meaning of section 199A and § 1.199A-3. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, income from the trade or business of performing services as an employee refers to all wages (within the meaning of section 3401(a)) and other income earned in a capacity as an employee, including payments described in § 1.6041-2(a)(1) (other than payments to individuals described in section 3121(d)(3)) and § 1.6041-2(b)(1).
(2)
Employer's Federal employment tax classification of employee immaterial.
For purposes of determining whether wages are earned in a capacity as an employee as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the treatment of an employee by an employer as anything other than an employee for Federal employment tax purposes is immaterial. Thus, if a worker should be properly classified as an employee, it is of no consequence that the employee is treated as a non-employee by the employer for Federal employment tax purposes.
(3)
Presumption that former employees are still employees
—(i)
Presumption.
Solely for purposes of section 199A(d)(1)(B) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an individual that was properly treated as an employee for Federal employment tax purposes by the person to which he or she provided services and who is subsequently treated as other than an employee by such person with regard to the provision of substantially the same services directly or indirectly to the person (or a related person), is presumed, for three years after ceasing to be treated as an employee for Federal employment tax purposes, to be in the trade or business of performing services as an employee with regard to such services. As provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, this presumption may be rebutted upon a showing by the individual that, under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including common-law employee classification rules), the individual is performing services in a capacity other than as an employee. This presumption applies regardless of whether the individual provides services directly or indirectly through an entity or entities.
(ii)
Rebuttal of presumption.
Upon notice from the IRS, an individual rebuts the presumption in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section by providing records, such as contracts or partnership agreements, that provide sufficient evidence to corroborate the individual's status as a non-employee.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provision of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Unless otherwise provided, the individual in each example has taxable income in excess of the threshold amount.
(A)
Example 1.
A is employed by PRS, a partnership for Federal tax purposes, as a fulltime employee and is treated as such for Federal employment tax purposes. A quits his job for PRS and enters into a contract with PRS under which A provides substantially the same services that A previously provided to PRS in A's capacity as an employee. Because A was treated as an employee for services he provided to PRS, and now is no longer treated as an employee with regard to such services, A is presumed (solely for purposes of section 199A(d)(1)(B) and paragraphs (a)(3) and (d) of this section) to be in the trade or business of performing services as an employee with regard to his services performed for PRS. Unless the presumption is rebutted with a showing that, under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including the common-law employee classification rules), A is not an employee, any amounts paid by PRS to A with respect to such services will not be QBI for purposes of section 199A. The presumption would apply even if, instead of contracting directly with PRS, A formed a disregarded entity, or a passthrough entity, and the entity entered into the contract with PRS.
(B)
Example 2.
C is an attorney employed as an associate in a law firm (Law Firm 1) and was treated as such
for Federal employment tax purposes. C and the other associates in Law Firm 1 have taxable income below the threshold amount. Law Firm 1 terminates its employment relationship with C and its other associates. C and the other former associates form a new partnership, Law Firm 2, which contracts to perform legal services for Law Firm 1. Therefore, in form, C is now a partner in Law Firm 2 which earns income from providing legal services to Law Firm 1. C continues to provide substantially the same legal services to Law Firm 1 and its clients. Because C was previously treated as an employee for services she provided to Law Firm 1, and now is no longer treated as an employee with regard to such services, C is presumed (solely for purposes of section 199A(d)(1)(B) and paragraphs (a)(3) and (d) of this section) to be in the trade or business of performing services as an employee with respect to the services C provides to Law Firm 1 indirectly through Law Firm 2.Unless the presumption is rebutted with a showing that, under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including common-law employee classification rules), C is not an employee, C's distributive share of Law Firm 2 income (including any guaranteed payments) will not be QBI for purposes of section 199A.The results in this example would not change if, instead of contracting with Law Firm 1, Law Firm 2 was instead admitted as a partner in Law Firm 1.
(C)
Example 3.
E is an engineer employed as a senior project engineer in an engineering firm, Engineering Firm. Engineering Firm is a partnership for Federal tax purposes and structured such that after 10 years, senior project engineers are considered for partner if certain career milestones are met. After 10 years, E meets those career milestones and is admitted as a partner in Engineering Firm. As a partner in Engineering Firm, E shares in the net profits of Engineering Firm, and also otherwise satisfies the requirements under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including common-law employee classification rules) to be respected as a partner. E is presumed (solely for purposes of section 199A(d)(1)(B) and paragraphs (a)(3) and (d) of this section) to be in the trade or business of performing services as an employee with respect to the services E provides to Engineering Firm. However, E is able to rebut the presumption by showing that E became a partner in Engineering Firm as a career milestone, shares in the overall net profits in Engineering Firm, and otherwise satisfies the requirements under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including common-law employee classification rules) to be respected as a partner.
(D)
Example 4.
F is a financial advisor employed by a financial advisory firm, Advisory Firm, a partnership for Federal tax purposes, as a fulltime employee and is treated as such for Federal employment tax purposes. F has taxable income below the threshold amount. Advisory Firm is a partnership and offers F the opportunity to be admitted as a partner. F elects to be admitted as a partner to Advisory Firm and is admitted as a partner to Advisory Firm. As a partner in Advisory Firm, F shares in the net profits of Advisory Firm, is obligated to Advisory Firm in ways that F was not previously obligated as an employee, is no longer entitled to certain benefits available only to employees of Advisory Firm, and has materially modified his relationship with Advisory Firm. F's share of net profits is not subject to a floor or capped at a dollar amount. F is presumed (solely for purposes of section 199A(d)(1)(B) and paragraphs (a)(3) and (d) of this section) to be in the trade or business of performing services as an employee with respect to the services F provides to Advisory Firm. However, F is able to rebut the presumption by showing that F became a partner in Advisory Firm by sharing in the profits of Advisory Firm, materially modifying F's relationship with Advisory Firm, and otherwise satisfying the requirements under Federal tax law, regulations, and principles (including common-law employee classification rules) to be respected as a partner.

Non-calendar year RPE.
For purposes of determining QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income, if an individual receives any of these items from an RPE with a taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018, and ends after December 31, 2017, such items are treated as having been incurred by the individual during the individual's taxable year in which or with which such RPE taxable year ends.
[T.D. 9847, 84 FR 3006, Feb. 8, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9847, 84 FR 15955, Apr. 17, 2019]
§ 1.199A-6
Relevant passthrough entities (RPEs), publicly traded partnerships (PTPs), trusts, and estates.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides special rules for RPEs, PTPs, trusts, and estates necessary for the computation of the section 199A deduction of their owners or beneficiaries. Paragraph (b) of this section provides computational and reporting rules for RPEs necessary for individuals who own interests in RPEs to calculate their section 199A deduction. Paragraph (c) of this section provides computational and reporting rules for PTPs necessary for individuals who own interests in PTPs to calculate their section 199A deduction. Paragraph (d) of this section provides computational and reporting rules for trusts (other than grantor trusts) and estates necessary for their beneficiaries to calculate their section 199A deduction.
(b)
Computational and reporting rules for RPEs
—(1)
In general.
An RPE must determine and report information attributable to any trades or businesses it is engaged in necessary for its owners to determine their section 199A deduction.
(2)
Computational rules.
Using the following four rules, an RPE must determine the items necessary for individuals who own interests in the RPE to calculate their section 199A deduction under § 1.199A-1(c) or (d). An RPE that chooses to aggregate trades or businesses under the rules of § 1.199A-4 may determine these items for the aggregated trade or business.
(i) First, the RPE must determine if it is engaged in one or more trades or businesses. The RPE must also determine whether any of its trades or businesses is an SSTB under the rules of § 1.199A-5.
(ii) Second, the RPE must apply the rules in § 1.199A-3 to determine the QBI for each trade or business engaged in directly.
(iii) Third, the RPE must apply the rules in § 1.199A-2 to determine the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property for each trade or business engaged in directly.
(iv) Fourth, the RPE must determine whether it has any qualified REIT dividends as defined in § 1.199A-3(c)(1) earned directly or through another RPE. The RPE must also determine the amount of qualified PTP income as defined in § 1.199A-3(c)(2) earned directly or indirectly through investments in PTPs.
(3)
Reporting rules for RPEs
—(i)
Trade or business directly engaged in.
An RPE must separately identify and report on the Schedule K-1 issued to its owners for any trade or business (including an aggregated trade or business) engaged in directly by the RPE—
(A) Each owner's allocable share of QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA of qualified property attributable to each such trade or business; and
(B) Whether any of the trades or businesses described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is an SSTB.
(ii)
Other items.
An RPE must also report on an attachment to the Schedule K-1, any QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, or SSTB determinations, reported to it by any RPE in which the RPE owns a direct or indirect interest. The RPE must also report each owner's allocated share of any qualified REIT dividends received by the RPE (including through another RPE) as well as any qualified PTP income or loss received by the RPE for each PTP in which the RPE holds an interest (including through another RPE). Such information can be reported on an amended or late filed return to the extent that the period of limitations remains open.
(iii)
Failure to report information.
If an RPE fails to separately identify or report on the Schedule K-1 (or any attachments thereto) issued to an owner an item described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the owner's share (and the share of any upper-tier indirect owner) of each unreported item of positive QBI, W-2 wages, or UBIA of qualified property attributable to trades or businesses engaged in by that RPE will be presumed to be zero.
(c)
Computational and reporting rules for PTPs
—(1)
Computational rules.
Each PTP must determine its QBI under the rules of § 1.199A-3 for each trade or business in which the PTP is engaged in directly. The PTP must also determine whether any of the trades or businesses it is engaged in directly is an SSTB.
(2)
Reporting rules.
Each PTP is required to separately identify and report the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on Schedules K-1 issued to its partners. Each PTP must also determine and report any qualified REIT dividends or qualified PTP income or loss received by the PTP including through an RPE, a REIT, or another PTP. A PTP is not required to determine or report W-2 wages or the UBIA of qualified property attributable to trades or businesses it is engaged in directly.
(d)
Application to trusts, estates, and beneficiaries
—(1)
In general.
A trust or estate computes its section 199A deduction based on the QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income that are allocated to the trust or estate. An individual beneficiary of a trust or estate takes into account any QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income allocated from a trust or estate in calculating the beneficiary's section 199A deduction, in the same manner as though the items had been allocated from an RPE. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-5, a trust or estate is treated as an RPE to the extent it allocates QBI and other items to its beneficiaries, and is treated as an individual to the extent it retains the QBI and other items.
(2)
Grantor trusts.
To the extent that the grantor or another person is treated as owning all or part of a trust under sections 671 through 679, such person computes its section 199A deduction as if that person directly conducted the activities of the trust with respect to the portion of the trust treated as owned by the grantor or other person.
(3)
Non-grantor trusts and estates
—(i)
Calculation at entity level.
A trust or estate must calculate its QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income. The QBI of a trust or estate must be computed by allocating qualified items of deduction described in section 199A(c)(3) in accordance with the classification of those deductions under § 1.652(b)-3(a), and deductions not directly attributable within the meaning of § 1.652(b)-3(b) (other deductions) are allocated in a manner consistent with the rules in § 1.652(b)-3(b). Any depletion and depreciation deductions described in section 642(e) and any amortization deductions described in section 642(f) that otherwise are properly included in the computation of QBI are included in the computation of QBI of the trust or estate, regardless of how those deductions may otherwise be allocated between the trust or estate and its beneficiaries for other purposes of the Code.
(ii)
Allocation among trust or estate and beneficiaries.
The QBI (including any amounts that may be less than zero as calculated at the trust or estate level), W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income of a trust or estate are allocated to each beneficiary and to the trust or estate based on the relative proportion of the trust's or estate's
distributable net income (DNI),
as defined by section 643(a), for the taxable year that is distributed or required to be distributed to the beneficiary or is retained by the trust or estate. For this purpose, the trust's or estate's DNI is determined with regard to the separate share rule of section 663(c), but without regard to section 199A. If the trust or estate has no DNI for the taxable year, any QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and
qualified PTP income are allocated entirely to the trust or estate.
(iii)
Separate shares.
In the case of a trust or estate described in section 663(c) with substantially separate and independent shares for multiple beneficiaries, such trust or estate will be treated as a single trust or estate for purposes of determining whether the taxable income of the trust or estate exceeds the threshold amount; determining taxable income, net capital gain, net QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified REIT dividends, and qualified PTP income for each trade or business of the trust and estate; and computing the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitations. The allocation of these items to the separate shares of a trust or estate will be governed by the rules under §§ 1.663(c)-1 through 1.663(c)-5, as they may be adjusted or clarified by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iv)
Threshold amount.
The threshold amount applicable to a trust or estate is $157,500 for any taxable year beginning before 2019. For taxable years beginning after 2018, the threshold amount shall be $157,500 increased by the cost-of-living adjustment as outlined in § 1.199A-1(b)(12). For purposes of determining whether a trust or estate has taxable income in excess of the threshold amount, the taxable income of the trust or estate is determined after taking into account any distribution deduction under sections 651 or 661.
(v)
Charitable remainder trusts.
A charitable remainder trust described in section 664 is not entitled to and does not calculate a section 199A deduction, and the threshold amount described in section 199A(e)(2) does not apply to the trust. However, any taxable recipient of a unitrust or annuity amount from the trust must determine and apply the recipient's own threshold amount for purposes of section 199A taking into account any annuity or unitrust amounts received from the trust. A recipient of a unitrust or annuity amount from a trust may take into account QBI, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income for purposes of determining the recipient's section 199A deduction for the taxable year to the extent that the unitrust or annuity amount distributed to such recipient consists of such section 199A items under § 1.664-1(d). For example, if a charitable remainder trust has investment income of $500, qualified dividend income of $200, and qualified REIT dividends of $1,000, and distributes $1,000 to the recipient, the trust would be treated as having income in two classes within the category of income, described in § 1.664-1(d)(1)(i)(
a
)(
1
), for purposes of § 1.664-1(d)(1)(ii)(
b
). Because the annuity amount first carries out income in the class subject to the highest income tax rate, the entire annuity payment comes from the class with the investment income and qualified REIT dividends. Thus, the charitable remainder trust would be treated as distributing a proportionate amount of the investment income ($500 / (1,000 + 500) * 1,000 = $333) and qualified REIT dividends ($1000 / (1,000 + 500) * 1000 = $667) because the investment income and qualified REIT dividends are taxed at the same rate and within the same class, which is higher than the rate of tax for the qualified dividend income in a separate class. The charitable remainder trust in this example would not be treated as distributing any of the qualified dividend income until it distributed all the investment income and qualified REIT dividends (more than $1,500 in total) to the recipient. To the extent that a trust is treated as distributing QBI, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income to more than one unitrust or annuity recipient in the taxable year, the distribution of such income will be treated as made to the recipients proportionately, based on their respective shares of total QBI, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income distributed for that year. The trust allocates and reports any W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property to the taxable recipient of the annuity or unitrust interest based on each recipient's share of the trust's total QBI (whether or not distributed) for that taxable year. Accordingly, if 10 percent of the QBI of a charitable remainder trust is distributed to the recipient and 90 percent of the QBI is retained by the trust, 10 percent of the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property is allocated
and reported to the recipient and 90 percent of the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property is treated as retained by the trust. However, any W-2 wages retained by the trust cannot be used to compute W-2 wages in a subsequent taxable year for section 199A purposes. Any QBI, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income of the trust that is unrelated business taxable income is subject to excise tax and that tax must be allocated to the corpus of the trust under § 1.664-1(c).
(vi)
Electing small business trusts.
An electing small business trust (ESBT) is entitled to the deduction under section 199A. Any section 199A deduction attributable to the assets in the S portion of the ESBT is to be taken into account by the S portion. The S portion of the ESBT must take into account the QBI and other items from any S corporation owned by the ESBT, the grantor portion of the ESBT must take into account the QBI and other items from any assets treated as owned by a grantor or another person (owned portion) of a trust under sections 671 through 679, and the non-S portion of the ESBT must take into account any QBI and other items from any other entities or assets owned by the ESBT. For purposes of determining whether the taxable income of an ESBT exceeds the threshold amount, the S portion and the non-S portion of an ESBT are treated as a single trust.
See
§ 1.641(c)-1.
(vii)
Anti-abuse rule for creation of a trust to avoid exceeding the threshold amount.
A trust formed or funded with a principal purpose of avoiding, or of using more than one, threshold amount for purposes of calculating the deduction under section 199A will not be respected as a separate trust entity for purposes of determining the threshold amount for purposes of section 199A.

)
Trust's distributive share of partnership items.
Trust, an irrevocable testamentary complex trust, is a 25% partner in PRS, a family partnership that operates a restaurant that generates QBI and W-2 wages. A and B, Trust's beneficiaries, own the remaining 75% of PRS directly. In 2018, PRS properly allocates gross income from the restaurant of $55,000, and expenses directly allocable to the restaurant of $45,000 (including W-2 wages of $25,000, and miscellaneous expenses of $20,000) to Trust. These items are properly included in Trust's DNI. PRS distributes $10,000 of cash to Trust in 2018.
(
ii
)
Trust's activities.
In addition to its interest in PRS, Trust also operates a family bakery conducted through an LLC wholly-owned by the Trust that is treated as a disregarded entity. In 2018, the bakery produces $100,000 of gross income and $155,000 of expenses directly allocable to operation of the bakery (including W-2 wages of $50,000, rental expense of $75,000, miscellaneous expenses of $25,000, and depreciation deductions of $5,000). (The net loss from the bakery operations is not subject to any loss disallowance provisions outside of section 199A.) Trust maintains a reserve of $5,000 for depreciation. Trust also has $125,000 of UBIA of qualified property in the bakery. For purposes of computing its section 199A deduction, Trust and its beneficiaries have properly chosen to aggregate the family restaurant conducted through PRS with the bakery conducted directly by Trust under § 1.199A-4. Trust also owns various investment assets that produce portfolio-type income consisting of dividends ($25,000), interest ($15,000), and tax-exempt interest ($15,000). Accordingly, Trust has the following items which are properly included in Trust's DNI:

Allocation of deductions under § 1.652(b)-3 (Directly attributable expenses).
In computing Trust's DNI for the taxable year, the distributive share
of expenses of PRS are directly attributable under § 1.652(b)-3(a) to the distributive share of income of PRS. Accordingly, Trust has gross business income of $155,000 ($55,000 from PRS and $100,000 from the bakery) and direct business expenses of $200,000 ($45,000 from PRS and $155,000 from the bakery). In addition, $1,000 of the trustee commissions and $1,000 of state and local taxes are directly attributable under § 1.652(b)-3(a) to Trust's business income. Accordingly, Trust has excess business deductions of $47,000. Pursuant to its authority recognized under § 1.652(b)-3(d), Trust allocates the $47,000 excess business deductions as follows: $15,000 to the interest income, resulting in $0 interest income, $25,000 to the dividends, resulting in $0 dividend income, and $7,000 to the tax exempt interest.
(

)
Allocation of deductions under § 1.652(b)-3 (Non-directly attributable expenses).
The trustee must allocate the sum of the balance of the trustee commissions ($2,000) and state and local taxes ($4,000) to Trust's remaining tax-exempt interest income, resulting in $2,000 of tax exempt interest.
(
v
)
Amounts included in taxable income.
For 2018, Trust has DNI of $2,000. Pursuant to Trust's governing instrument, Trustee distributes 50%, or $1,000, of that DNI to A, an individual who is a discretionary beneficiary of Trust. In addition, Trustee is required to distribute 25%, or $500, of that DNI to B, a current income beneficiary of Trust. Trust retains the remaining 25% of DNI. Consequently, with respect to the $1,000 distribution A receives from Trust, A properly excludes $1,000 of tax-exempt interest income under section 662(b). With respect to the $500 distribution B receives from Trust, B properly excludes $500 of tax exempt interest income under section 662(b). Because the DNI consists entirely of tax-exempt income, Trust deducts $0 under section 661 with respect to the distributions to A and B.

Section 199A deduction

)
Trust's W-2 wages and QBI.
For the 2018 taxable year, prior to allocating the beneficiaries' shares of the section 199A items, Trust has $75,000 ($25,000 from PRS + $50,000 of Trust) of W-2 wages. Trust also has $125,000 of UBIA of qualified property. Trust has negative QBI of ($47,000) ($155,000 gross income from aggregated businesses less the sum of $200,000 direct expenses from aggregated businesses and $2,000 directly attributable business expenses from Trust under the rules of § 1.652(b)-3(a)).
(
ii
)
A's Section 199A deduction computation.
Because the $1,000 Trust distribution to A equals one-half of Trust's DNI, A has W-2 wages from Trust of $37,500. A also has W-2 wages of $2,500 from a trade or business outside of Trust (computed without regard to A's interest in Trust), which A has properly aggregated under § 1.199A-4 with the Trust's trade or businesses (the family's restaurant and bakery), for a total of $40,000 of W-2 wages from the aggregate trade or businesses. A also has $62,500 of UBIA from Trust and $25,000 of UBIA of qualified property from the trade or business outside of Trust for $87,500 of total UBIA of qualified property. A has $100,000 of QBI from the non-Trust trade or businesses in which A owns an interest. Because the $1,000 Trust distribution to A equals one-half of Trust's DNI, A has (negative) QBI from Trust of ($23,500). A's total QBI is determined by combining the $100,000 QBI from non-Trust sources with the ($23,500) QBI from Trust for a total of $76,500 of QBI. Assume that A's taxable income is $357,500, which exceeds A's applicable threshold amount for 2018 by $200,000. A's tentative deductible amount is $15,300 (20% × $76,500 of QBI), limited to the greater of (i) $20,000 (50% × $40,000 of W-2 wages), or (ii) $12,187.50 ($10,000, 25% × $40,000 of W-2 wages, plus $2,187.50, 2.5% × $87,500 of UBIA of qualified property). A's section 199A deduction is equal to the lesser of $15,300, or $71,500 (20% × $357,500 of taxable income). Accordingly, A's section 199A deduction for 2018 is $15,300.
(

)
B's Section 199A deduction computation.
For 2018, B's taxable income is below the threshold amount so B is not subject to the W-2 wage limitation. Because the $500 Trust distribution to B equals one-quarter of Trust's DNI, B has a total of ($11,750) of QBI. B also has no QBI from non-Trust trades or businesses, so B has a total of ($11,750) of QBI. Accordingly, B's section 199A deduction for 2018 is zero. The ($11,750)
of QBI is carried over to 2019 as a loss from a qualified business in the hands of B pursuant to section 199A(c)(2).
(
iv
)
Trust's Section 199A deduction computation.
For 2018, Trust's taxable income is below the threshold amount so it is not subject to the W-2 wage limitation. Because Trust retained 25% of Trust's DNI, Trust is allocated 25% of its QBI, which is ($11,750). Trust's section 199A deduction for 2018 is zero. The ($11,750) of QBI is carried over to 2019 as a loss from a qualified business in the hands of Trust pursuant to section 199A(c)(2).

§ 1.199A-7
Section 199A(a) Rules for Cooperatives and their patrons.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
This section provides guidance and special rules on the application of the rules of §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6 regarding the deduction for qualified business income (QBI) under section 199A(a) (section 199A(a) deduction) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) by patrons (patrons) of cooperatives to which Part I of subchapter T of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter T) applies (Cooperatives). Unless otherwise provided in this section, all the rules in §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6 relating to calculating the section 199A(a) deduction apply to patrons and Cooperatives. Paragraph (b) of this section provides special rules for patrons relating to trades or businesses. Paragraph (c) of this section provides special rules for patrons and Cooperatives relating to the definition of QBI. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for patrons and Cooperatives relating to specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs). Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules for patrons relating to the statutory limitations based on W-2 wages and unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property. Paragraph (f) of this section provides special rules for specified agricultural or horticultural cooperatives (Specified Cooperatives) and paragraph (g) of this section provides examples for Specified Cooperatives and their patrons. Paragraph (h) of this section sets forth the applicability date of this section and a special transition rule relating to Specified Cooperatives and their patrons.
(2)
At patron level.
The section 199A(a) deduction is applied at the patron level, and patrons who are individuals (as defined in § 1.199A-1(a)(2)) may take the section 199A(a) deduction.
(3)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 199A and § 1.199A-7, the following definitions apply—
(i)
Individual
is defined in § 1.199A-1(a)(2).
(ii)
Patron
is defined in § 1.1388-1(e).
(iii)
Patronage and nonpatronage
is defined in § 1.1388-1(f).
(iv)
Relevant Passthrough Entity (RPE)
is defined in § 1.199A-1(a)(9).
(v)
Qualified payment
is defined in § 1.199A-8(d)(2)(ii).
(vi)
Specified Cooperative
is defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(2) and is a subset of Cooperatives defined in § 1.199A-7(a)(1).
(b)
Trade or business.
A patron (whether the patron is an RPE or an individual), and not a Cooperative, must determine whether it has one or more trades or businesses that it directly conducts as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(14). To the extent a patron operating a trade or business has income directly from that business, the patron must follow the rules of §§ 1.199A-1 through 1.199A-6 to calculate the section 199A(a) deduction. Patronage dividends or similar payments are considered to be generated from the trade or business the Cooperative conducts on behalf of or with the patron. A Cooperative that distributes patronage dividends or similar payments, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, must determine and report information to its patrons relating to qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(3) of this section. A patron that receives patronage dividends or similar payments, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, from a Cooperative must follow the rules of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section to calculate the section 199A(a) deduction.
(c)
Qualified Business Income
—(1)
In general.
QBI means the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to any trade or business as determined under the rules of section 199A(c)(3) and § 1.199A-3(b). A qualified item of income includes distributions for which the Cooperative is allowed a deduction under section 1382(b) and (c)(2) (including patronage dividends or similar payments, such as money, property, qualified written notices of allocations, and qualified per-unit retain certificates, as well as money or property paid in redemption of a nonqualified written notice of allocation (collectively patronage dividends or similar payments)), provided such distribution is otherwise a qualified item of income, gain, deduction, or loss.
See
special rule in paragraph (d)(3) of this section relating to SSTBs that may affect QBI.
(2)
QBI determinations made by patron.
A patron must determine QBI for each trade or business it directly conducts. In situations where the patron receives distributions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Cooperative must determine whether those distributions include qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss as determined under rules of section 199A(c)(3) and § 1.199A-3(b).These distributions may be included in the QBI of the patron's trade or business to the extent that:
(i) The distributions are related to the patron's trade or business as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(14);
(ii) The distributions are qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss as determined under rules of section 199A(c)(3) and § 1.199A-3(b) at the Cooperative's trade or business level;
(iii) The distributions are not items from an SSTB as defined in section 199A(d)(2) at the Cooperative's trade or business level (except as permitted by the threshold rules in section 199A(d)(3) and § 1.199A-5(a)(2)); and
(iv) Certain information is reported by the Cooperative about these payments as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(3) of this section.
(3)
Qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss determinations made and reported by Cooperatives.
In the case of a Cooperative that makes distributions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to a patron, the Cooperative must determine the amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss as determined under the rules of section 199A(c)(3) and § 1.199A-3(b) in those distributions. A patron must determine whether these qualified items relate to one or more trades or businesses that it directly conducts as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(14). Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), the Cooperative must report the net amount of qualified items with respect to non-SSTBs of the Cooperative in the distributions made to the patron on an attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received From Cooperatives, (or any successor
form) issued by the Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form. If the Cooperative does not report on or before the due date of the Form 1099-PATR the amount of such qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss in the distributions to the patron, the amount of distributions from the Cooperative that may be included in the patron's QBI is presumed to be zero.
See
special rule in paragraph (d)(3) of this section relating to reporting of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to SSTBs of the Cooperative.
(d)
Specified Service Trades or Businesses
—(1)
In general.
This section provides guidance on the determination of SSTBs as defined in section 199A(d)(2) and § 1.199A-5. Unless otherwise provided in this section, all of the rules in § 1.199A-5 relating to SSTBs apply to patrons of Cooperatives.
(2)
SSTB determinations made by patron.
A patron (whether an RPE or an individual) must determine whether each trade or business it directly conducts is an SSTB.
(3)
SSTB determinations made and reported by Cooperatives
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a Cooperative that makes distributions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to a patron, the Cooperative must determine the amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss as determined under the rules of section 199A(c)(3) and § 1.199A-3(b) with respect to SSTBs directly conducted by the Cooperative. A patron must determine whether these qualified items relate to one or more trades or businesses that it directly conducts as defined in § 1.199A-1(b)(14). The Cooperative must report the net amount of qualified items with respect to the SSTBs of the Cooperative in the distributions made to the patron on an attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received from Cooperatives, (or any successor form) issued by the Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form. If the Cooperative does not report the amount on or before the due date of the Form 1099-PATR, then only the amount that a Cooperative reports as qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss under § 1.199A-7(c)(3) may be included in the patron's QBI, and the remaining amount of distributions from the Cooperative that may be included in the patron's QBI is presumed to be zero.
(ii)
Patron allocation of expenses paid to Cooperative for SSTB items of income reported by Cooperative
—(A)
In general.
When a Cooperative reports SSTB items to a patron, a patron may allocate a deductible expense that was paid to the Cooperative in connection with the patron's qualified trade or business between a patron's qualified trade or business income and the SSTB income reported to it by the Cooperative only if the SSTB income directly relates to the deductible expense. A patron can allocate the deductible expense paid by the patron to the Cooperative only up to the amount of SSTB income reported by the Cooperative.
(B)
Example. Patron allocating expenses between qualified trade or business and SSTB income from a Cooperative.
(
1
) Cooperative provides to its patrons a service that is an SSTB under section 199A(d)(2). P, a patron, runs a qualified trade or business under section 199A(d)(1) and incurs expenses for the service from the Cooperative in P's qualified trade or business. P pays the Cooperative $1,000 for the service. Cooperative later pays P a patronage dividend of $50 related to the service.
(
2
) Cooperative reports the $50 as SSTB income on the Form 1099-PATR issued to P.
(
3
) Since P's deductible expense for services from the Cooperative was in connection with a qualified trade or business and the SSTB income directly relates to that expense, P may allocate the expense under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, $50 of the $1,000 expense is allocated to P's SSTB income, and $950 of the expense is allocated to P's qualified trade or business and is included in P's QBI calculation.
(e)
W-2 wages and unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property
—(1)
In general.
This section provides guidance on calculating a trade or business's W-2 wages and the UBIA of qualified property properly allocable to QBI.
(2)
Determinations made by patron.
The determination of W-2 wages and UBIA
of qualified property must be made for each trade or business by the patron (whether an RPE or individual) that directly conducts the trade or business before applying the aggregation rules of § 1.199A-4. Unlike RPEs, Cooperatives do not compute and allocate their W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property to patrons.
(f)
Special rules for patrons of Specified Cooperatives
—(1)
Section 199A(b)(7) reduction.
A patron of a Specified Cooperative that receives a qualified payment must reduce its section 199A(a) deduction as provided in § 1.199A-1(e)(7). This reduction applies whether the Specified Cooperative passes through all, some, or none of the Specified Cooperative's section 199A(g) deduction to the patron in that taxable year. The rules relating to the section 199A(g) deduction can be found in §§ 1.199A-8 through 1.199A-12.
(2)
Reduction calculation
—(i)
Allocation method.
If in any taxable year, a patron receives income or gain related to qualified payments and income or gain that is not related to qualified payments in a trade or business, the patron must allocate the income or gain and related deductions, losses and W-2 wages using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances for purposes of calculating the reduction in § 1.199A-1(e)(7). Different reasonable methods may be used for different items and related deductions of income, gain, deduction, and loss. The chosen reasonable method for each item must be consistently applied from one taxable year of the patron to another, and must clearly reflect the income and expenses of each trade or business. The overall combination of methods must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for a trade or business must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (f)(2)(i).
(ii)
Safe harbor.
A patron with taxable income under the threshold amount set forth in section 199A(e)(2) is eligible to use the safe harbor set forth in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) to apportion its deductions, losses and W-2 wages instead of the allocation method set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for any taxable year in which the patron receives income or gain related to qualified payments and income or gain not related to qualified payments in a trade or business. Under the safe harbor the patron may apportion its deductions, losses and W-2 wages ratably between income or gain related to qualified payments and income or gain that is not related to qualified payments for purposes of calculating the reduction in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the amount of deductions and losses apportioned to determine QBI allocable to qualified payments is equal to the proportion of the total deductions and losses that the amount of income or gain related to qualified payments bears to total income or gain used to determine QBI. The same proportion applies to determine the amount of W-2 wages allocable to the portion of the trade or business that received qualified payments.
(3)
Qualified payments notice requirement.
A Specified Cooperative must report the amount of the qualified payments made to the eligible taxpayer, as defined in section 199A(g)(2)(D), on an attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR (or any successor form) issued by the Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume that the Specified Cooperative has satisfied the applicable written notice requirements in paragraphs (c)(3), (d)(3) and (f)(3) of this section.
(1)
Example 1. Patron of Specified Cooperative with W-2 wages.
(i) P, a grain farmer and patron of nonexempt Specified Cooperative C, delivered to C during 2020 2% of all grain marketed through C during such year. During 2021, P receives $20,000 in patronage dividends and $1,000 of allocated section 199A(g) deduction from C related to the grain delivered to C during 2020.
(ii) P has taxable income of $75,000 for 2021 (determined without regard to section 199A) and has a filing status of married filing jointly. P's QBI related to its grain trade or business for 2021 is $50,000, which consists of gross receipts of $150,000 from sales to an independent
grain elevator, per-unit retain allocations received from C during 2021 of $80,000, patronage dividends received from C during 2021 related to C's 2020 net earnings of $20,000, and expenses of $200,000 (including $50,000 of W-2 wages).
(iii) The portion of QBI from P's grain trade or business related to qualified payments received from C during 2021 is $10,000, which consists of per-unit retain allocations received from C during 2021 of $80,000, patronage dividends received from C during 2021 related to C's 2020 net earnings of $20,000, and properly allocable expenses of $90,000 (including $25,000 of W-2 wages).
(iv) P's deductible amount related to the grain trade or business is 20% of QBI ($10,000) reduced by the lesser of 9% of QBI related to qualified payments received from C ($900) or 50% of W-2 wages related to qualified payments received from C ($12,500), or $9,100. As P does not have any other trades or businesses, the combined QBI amount is also $9,100.
(v) P's deduction under section 199A for 2021 is $10,100, which consists of the combined QBI amount of $9,100, plus P's deduction passed through from C of $1,000.
(2)
Example 2. Patron of Specified Cooperative without W-2 wages.
(i) C and P have the same facts for 2020 and 2021 as
Example 1,
except that P has expenses of $200,000 that include zero W-2 wages during 2021.
(ii) P's deductible amount related to the grain trade or business is 20% of QBI ($10,000) reduced by the lesser of 9% of QBI related to qualified payments received from C ($900) or 50% of W-2 wages related to qualified payments received from C ($0), or $10,000.
(iii) P's deduction under section 199A for 2021 is $11,000, which consists of the combined QBI amount of $10,000, plus P's deduction passed through from C of $1,000.
(3)
Example 3. Patron of Specified Cooperative—Qualified Payments do not equal QBI and no section 199A(g) passthrough.
(i) P, a grain farmer and a patron of a nonexempt Specified Cooperative C, during 2020, receives $60,000 in patronage dividends, $100,000 in per-unit retain allocations, and $0 of allocated section 199A(g) deduction from C related to the grain delivered to C. C notifies P that only $150,000 of the patronage dividends and per-unit retain allocations are qualified payments because $10,000 of the payments are not attributable to C's QPAI.
(ii) P has taxable income of $90,000 (determined without regard to section 199A) and has a filing status of married filing jointly. P's QBI related to its grain trade or business is $45,000, which consists of gross receipts of $95,000 from sales to an independent grain elevator, plus $160,000 from C (all payments from C qualify as qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss), less expenses of $210,000 (including $30,000 of W-2 wages).
(iii) The portion of QBI from P's grain trade or business related to qualified payments received from C is $25,000, which consists of the qualified payments received from C of $150,000, less the properly allocable expenses of $125,000 (including $18,000 of W-2 wages), which were determined using a reasonable method under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iv) P's patron reduction is $2,250, which is the lesser of 9% of QBI related to qualified payments received from C, $2,250 (9% × $25,000), or 50% of W-2 wages related to qualified payments received from C, $9,000 (50% × $18,000). As P does not have any other trades or businesses, the combined QBI amount is $6,750 (20% of P's total QBI, $9,000 (20% × $45,000), reduced by the patron reduction of $2,250).
(v) P's deduction under section 199A is $6,750, which consists of the combined QBI amount of $6,750.
(4)
Example 4. Patron of Specified Cooperative—Reasonable Method under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
P is a grain farmer that has $45,000 of QBI related to P's grain trade or business in 2020. P's QBI consists of $105,000 of sales to an independent grain elevator, $100,000 of per-unit retain allocations, and $50,000 of patronage dividends from a nonexempt Specified Cooperative C, for which C reports $150,000 of qualified payments to P as required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section. P's grain trade or business has $210,000 of expenses (including $30,000 of W-2 wages). P delivered 65x bushels of grain to C
and sold 35x bushels of comparable grain to the independent grain elevator. To allocate the expenses between qualified payments ($150,000) and other income ($105,000), P compares the bushels of grain delivered to C (65x) to the total bushels of grain delivered to C and sold to the independent grain elevator (100x). P determines $136,500 (65% × $210,000) of expenses (including $19,500 of W-2 wages) are properly allocable to the qualified payments. The portion of QBI from P's grain trade or business related to qualified payments received from C is $13,500, which consists of qualified payments of $150,000 less the properly allocable expenses of $136,500 (including $19,500 of W-2 wages). P's method of allocating expenses is a reasonable method under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(5)
Example 5. Patron of Specified Cooperative using safe harbor to allocate.
(i) P is a grain farmer with taxable income of $100,000 for 2021 (determined without regard to section 199A) and has a filing status of married filing jointly. P's QBI related to P's grain trade or business for 2021 is $50,000, which consists of gross receipts of $180,000 from sales to an independent grain elevator, per-unit retain allocations received from a Specified Cooperative C during 2021 of $15,000, patronage dividends received from C during 2021 related to C's 2020 net earnings of $5,000, and expenses of $150,000 (including $50,000 of W-2 wages). C also passed through $1,800 of the section 199A(g) deduction to P, which related to the grain delivered by P to the Specified Cooperative during 2020. P uses the safe harbor in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section to determine the expenses (including W-2 wages) allocable to the qualified payments.
(ii) Using the safe harbor to allocate P's $150,000 of expenses, P allocates $15,000 of the expenses to the qualified payments ($150,000 of expenses multiplied by the ratio (0.10) of qualified payments ($20,000) to total gross receipts ($200,000)). Using the same ratio, P also determines there are $5,000 of W-2 wages allocable ($50,000 multiplied by 0.10) to the qualified payments.
(iii) The portion of QBI from P's grain trade or business related to qualified payments received from C during 2021 is $5,000, which consists of per-unit retain allocations received from C during 2021 of $15,000, patronage dividends of $5,000, and properly allocable expenses of $15,000 (including $5,000 of W-2 wages).
(iv) P's QBI related to the grain trade or business is 20% of QBI ($10,000) reduced by the lesser of 9% of QBI related to qualified payments received from C ($450) or 50% of W-2 wages related to qualified payments received from C ($2,500), or $9,550. As P does not have any other trades or businesses, the combined QBI amount is also $9,550.
(v) P's deduction under section 199A for 2021 is $11,350, which consists of the combined QBI amount of $9,550, plus P's deduction passed through from C of $1,800.

For additional rules addressing an expanded affiliated group (EAG), to which the principles of this section apply,
see
§ 1.199A-12. The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
(2)
Specified Cooperative
—(i)
In general.
Specified Cooperative means a cooperative to which Part I of subchapter T of chapter 1 of the Code applies and which—
(A) Manufactures, produces, grows, or extracts (MPGE) in whole or significant part within the United States any agricultural or horticultural product, or
(B) Is engaged in the marketing of agricultural or horticultural products that have been MPGE in whole or significant part within the United States by the patrons of the cooperative.
(C) See § 1.199A-9 for rules to determine if a Specified Cooperative has MPGE an agricultural or horticultural product in whole or significant part within the United States.
(ii)
Types of Specified Cooperatives.
A Specified Cooperative that is qualified as a farmer's cooperative organization under section 521 is an
exempt Specified Cooperative,
while a Specified Cooperative not so qualified is a
nonexempt Specified Cooperative.
(3)
Patron
is defined in § 1.1388-1(e).
(4)
Agricultural or horticultural products
are agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, livestock and the products thereof, the products of poultry and bee raising, the edible products of forestry, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and processed or manufactured products thereof within the meaning of the Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 802 (1926). Agricultural or horticultural products also include aquatic products that are farmed. Some examples of agricultural or horticultural products include, but are not limited to, fruits, grains, oilseeds, rice, vegetables, legumes, grasses (including hay), plants of all kinds, flowers (including hops), seeds, tobacco, cotton, sugar cane and sugar beets. Some examples of livestock products include, but are not limited to, wool, fur, hides, eggs, down, honey, and silk. Some examples of edible forestry products include, but are not limited to, fruits, nuts, berries and mushrooms. Some examples of aquatic products include, but are not limited to, fish, crustaceans, shellfish and seaweed. In addition, agricultural or horticultural products include fertilizer, diesel fuel, and other supplies (for example, seed, feed, herbicides, and pesticides) used in agricultural or horticultural production that are MPGE by a Specified Cooperative. Agricultural or horticultural products, however, do not include intangible property other than when incorporated into a tangible agricultural or horticultural product (other than as provided in the exception in § 1.199A-9(b)(2)). Intangible property for this purpose includes, for example, the rights to MPGE and sell an agricultural or horticultural product with certain characteristics protected by a patent, or the rights to a trademark or tradename. This exclusion of intangible property does not apply to intangible characteristics of
any particular agricultural or horticultural product. For example, gross receipts from the sale of different varieties of oranges would be considered from the disposition of agricultural or horticultural products. However, gross receipts from the license of the right to produce and sell a certain variety of an orange would be considered separate from the orange and not from an agricultural or horticultural product.
(b)
Steps for a nonexempt Specified Cooperative in calculating deduction
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, this paragraph (b) applies only to nonexempt Specified Cooperatives.
(2)
Step 1—Gross receipts and related deductions
—(i)
Identify.
To determine the section 199A(g) deduction, a Specified Cooperative first identifies its patronage and nonpatronage gross receipts and related cost of goods sold (COGS), deductible expenses, W-2 wages, etc. (deductions) and allocates them between patronage and nonpatronage. A single definition for the term
patronage and nonpatronage
is found in § 1.1388-1(f).
(ii)
Applicable gross receipts and deductions.
Except as described in this paragraph (b)(ii), for all purposes of the section 199A(g) deduction, a Specified Cooperative can use only patronage gross receipts and related deductions to calculate qualified production activities income (QPAI) as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, oil-related QPAI as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, the W-2 wage limitation in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, or taxable income as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section. A Specified Cooperative cannot use its nonpatronage gross receipts and related deductions to calculate its section 199A(g) deduction, other than treating all of its nonpatronage gross receipts as patronage non-DPGR for purposes of applying the de minimis rules in § 1.199A-9(c)(3). If a Specified Cooperative treats all nonpatronage gross receipts as DPGR under § 1.199A-9(c)(3)(i), then a Specified Cooperative shall also treat its deductions related to the nonpatronage gross receipts as patronage in calculating QPAI, oil-related QPAI, the W-2 wage limitation, or taxable income for purposes of the section 199A(g) deduction.
(iii)
Gross receipts
are the Specified Cooperative's receipts for the taxable year that are recognized under the Specified Cooperative's methods of accounting used for Federal income tax purposes for the taxable year. See § 1.199A-12 if the gross receipts are recognized in an intercompany transaction within the meaning of § 1.1502-13. Gross receipts include total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (except interest under section 103 but including original issue discount), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether the amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the Specified Cooperative's trade or business. Gross receipts are not reduced by COGS or by the cost of property sold if such property is described in section 1221(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5). Finally, gross receipts do not include amounts received by the Specified Cooperative with respect to sales tax or other similar state or local taxes if, under the applicable state or local law, the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service and the Specified Cooperative merely collects and remits the tax to the taxing authority. If, in contrast, the tax is imposed on the Specified Cooperative under the applicable law, then gross receipts include the amounts received that are allocable to the payment of such tax.
(3)
Step 2—Determine gross receipts that are DPGR
—(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative examines its patronage gross receipts to determine which of these are DPGR. A Specified Cooperative does not use nonpatronage gross receipts to determine DPGR.
(ii)
DPGR
are the gross receipts of the Specified Cooperative that are derived from any lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of an agricultural or horticultural product that is MPGE by the Specified Cooperative or its patrons in whole or significant part within the United States. DPGR does not include gross receipts derived from services or the lease,
rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of land unless a de minimis or other exception applies. See § 1.199A-9 for additional rules on determining if gross receipts are DPGR.
(4)
Step 3—Determine QPAI
—(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative determines QPAI from patronage DPGR and patronage deductions identified in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(2)(i) of this section, respectively. A Specified Cooperative does not use nonpatronage gross receipts or deductions to determine QPAI.
(ii)
QPAI
for the taxable year means an amount equal to the excess (if any) of—
(A) DPGR for the taxable year, over
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) COGS that are allocable to DPGR, and
(
2
) Other expenses, losses, or deductions (other than the section 199A(g) deduction) that are properly allocable to DPGR.
(C)
QPAI computational rules.
QPAI is computed without taking into account the section 199A(g) deduction or any deduction allowed under section 1382(b).
See
§ 1.199A-10 for additional rules on calculating QPAI.
(5)
Step 4—Calculate deduction
—(i)
In general.
From QPAI and taxable income, a Specified Cooperative calculates its section 199A(g) deduction as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Deduction
—(A)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative is allowed a deduction equal to 9 percent of the lesser of—
(
1
) QPAI of the Specified Cooperative for the taxable year, or
(
2
) Taxable income of the Specified Cooperative for the taxable year.
(B)
W-2 wage limitation.
The deduction allowed under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section for any taxable year cannot exceed 50 percent of the patronage W-2 wages attributable to DPGR for the taxable year.
See
§ 1.199A-11 for additional rules on calculating the patronage W-2 wage limitation.
(C)
Taxable income.
Taxable income is defined in section 63, and adjusted under section 1382 and § 1.1382-1 and § 1.1382-2. For purposes of determining the amount of the deduction allowed under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, taxable income is limited to taxable income and related deductions from patronage sources, other than as allowed under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Taxable income is computed without taking into account the section 199A(g) deduction or any deduction allowable under section 1382(b). Patronage net operating losses (NOLs) reduce taxable income in the amount that the Specified Cooperative would use to reduce taxable income (no lower than zero) before using the section 199A(g) deduction, but do not reduce taxable income that is the result of not taking into account any deduction allowable under section 1382(b).
(6)
Use of patronage section 199A(g) deduction.
Except as provided in § 1.199A-12(c)(2) related to the rules for EAGs, the patronage section 199A(g) deduction cannot create or increase a patronage or nonpatronage NOL or the amount of a patronage or nonpatronage NOL carryover or carryback, if applicable, in accordance with section 172. A patronage section 199A(g) deduction can be applied only against patronage income and deductions. A patronage section 199A(g) deduction that is not used in the appropriate taxable year is lost. To the extent that a Specified Cooperative passes through the section 199A(g) deduction to patrons and appropriately adjusts the section 1382 deduction under § 1.199A-8(d), the amount passed through is not considered to create or increase a patronage or nonpatronage NOL or the amount of a patronage or nonpatronage NOL carryover or carryback, if applicable, in accordance with section 172.
(7)
Special rules for nonexempt Specified Cooperatives that have oil-related QPAI
—(i)
Reduction of section 199A(g) deduction.
If a Specified Cooperative has oil-related QPAI for any taxable year, the amount otherwise allowable as a deduction under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section must be reduced by 3 percent of the least of—
(A) Oil-related QPAI of the Specified Cooperative for the taxable year,
(B) QPAI of the Specified Cooperative for the taxable year, or
(C) Taxable income of the Specified Cooperative for the taxable year.
(ii)
Oil-related QPAI
means, for any taxable year, the patronage QPAI that is attributable to the production, refining, processing, transportation, or distribution of oil, gas, or any primary product thereof (within the meaning of section 927(a)(2)(C), as in effect before its repeal) during such taxable year. Oil-related QPAI for any taxable year is an amount equal to the excess (if any) of patronage DPGR derived from the production, refining or processing of oil, gas, or any primary product thereof (oil-related DPGR) over the sum of—
(A) COGS of the Specified Cooperative that is allocable to such receipts; and
(B) Other expenses, losses, or deductions (other than the section 199A(g) deduction) that are properly allocable to such receipts.
(iii)
Special rule for patronage oil-related DPGR.
Oil-related DPGR does not include gross receipts derived from the transportation or distribution of oil, gas, or any primary product thereof. However, to the extent that the nonexempt Specified Cooperative treats gross receipts derived from transportation or distribution of oil, gas, or any primary product thereof as part of DPGR under § 1.199A-9(c)(3)(i), or under § 1.199A-9(j)(3)(i)(B), then the Specified Cooperative must treat those patronage gross receipts as oil-related DGPR.
(iv)
Oil
includes oil recovered from both conventional and non-conventional recovery methods, including crude oil, shale oil, and oil recovered from tar/oil sands. The
primary product from oil
includes all products derived from the destructive distillation of oil, including volatile products, light oils such as motor fuel and kerosene, distillates such as naphtha, lubricating oils, greases and waxes, and residues such as fuel oil. The
primary product from gas
means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gas wells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing, including natural gas, condensates, liquefied petroleum gases such as ethane, propane, and butane, and liquid products such as natural gasoline. The primary products from oil and gas provided in this paragraph (b)(7)(iv) are not intended to represent either the only primary products from oil or gas, or the only processes from which primary products may be derived under existing and future technologies. Examples of non-primary products include, but are not limited to, petrochemicals, medicinal products, insecticides, and alcohols.
(c)
Exempt Specified Cooperatives
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (c) applies only to exempt Specified Cooperatives.
(2)
Two section 199A(g) deductions.
The Specified Cooperative must calculate two separate section 199A(g) deductions, one patronage sourced and the other nonpatronage sourced, unless a Specified Cooperative treats all of its nonpatronage gross receipts and related deductions as patronage as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Patronage and nonpatronage gross receipts, related COGS that are allocable to DPGR, and other expenses, losses, or deductions (other than the section 199A(g) deduction) that are properly allocable to DPGR (deductions), DPGR, QPAI, NOLs, W-2 wages, etc. are not netted to calculate these two separate section 199A(g) deductions.
(3)
Exempt Specified Cooperative patronage section 199A(g) deduction.
The Specified Cooperative calculates its patronage section 199A(g) deduction following steps 1 through 4 in paragraphs (b)(2) through (5) of this section as if it were a nonexempt Specified Cooperative.
(4)
Exempt Specified Cooperative nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction
—(i)
In general.
The Specified Cooperative calculates its nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction following steps 2 through 4 in paragraphs (b)(2) through (5) of this section using only nonpatronage gross receipts and related nonpatronage deductions, unless a Specified Cooperative treats all of its nonpatronage gross receipts and related deductions as patronage as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. For purposes of determining the amount of the nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction allowed under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, taxable income is limited to taxable income and related deductions from nonpatronage sources. Nonpatronage NOLs reduce taxable income. Taxable income
is computed without taking into account the section 199A(g) deduction or any deduction allowable under section 1382(c).
(ii)
Use of nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction.
Except as provided in § 1.199A-12(c)(2) related to the rules for EAGs, the nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction cannot create or increase a nonpatronage NOL or the amount of nonpatronage NOL carryover or carryback, if applicable, in accordance with section 172. A Specified Cooperative cannot pass through its nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction under paragraph (d) of this section and can apply the nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction only against its nonpatronage income and deductions. As is the case for the patronage section 199A(g) deduction, the nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction that a Specified Cooperative does not use in the appropriate taxable year is lost.
(d)
Discretion to pass through deduction
—(1)
Permitted amount
(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative may, at its discretion, pass through all, some, or none of its patronage section 199A(g) deduction to all patrons. Only eligible taxpayers as defined in section 199A(g)(2)(D) may claim the section 199A(g) deduction that is passed through. A Specified Cooperative member of a federated cooperative may pass through the patronage section 199A(g) deduction it receives from the federated cooperative to its member patrons.
(ii)
Specified Cooperative identifies eligibility of patron.
If a Specified Cooperative determines that a patron is not an eligible taxpayer, then the Specified Cooperative may, at its discretion, retain any of the patronage section 199A(g) deduction attributable to the patron that would otherwise be passed through and lost under the general rule in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Amount of deduction being passed through
—(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative is permitted to pass through an amount equal to the portion of the Specified Cooperative's section 199A(g) deduction that is allowed with respect to the portion of the cooperative's QPAI that is attributable to the qualified payments the Specified Cooperative distributed to the patron during the taxable year and identified on the notice required in § 1.199A-7(f)(3) on an attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received From Cooperatives (Form 1099-PATR), (or any successor form) issued by the Specified Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form 1099-PATR. The notice requirement to pass through the section 199A(g) deduction is in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Qualified payment
means any amount of a patronage dividend or per-unit retain allocation, as described in section 1385(a)(1) or (3) received by a patron from a Specified Cooperative that is attributable to the portion of the Specified Cooperative's QPAI, for which the cooperative is allowed a section 199A(g) deduction. For this purpose, patronage dividends include any advances on patronage and per-unit retain allocations include per-unit retains paid in money during the taxable year.
(3)
Notice requirement to pass through deduction.
A Specified Cooperative must identify in a written notice the amount of the section 199A(g) deduction being passed through to its patrons. This written notice must be mailed by the Specified Cooperative to the patron no later than the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year of the Specified Cooperative. The Specified Cooperative may use the same written notice, if any, that it uses to notify the patron of the patron's respective allocations of patronage distributions, or may use a separate timely written notice(s) to comply with this section. The Specified Cooperative must report the amount of section 199A(g) deduction passed through to the patron on an attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR (or any successor form) issued by the Specified Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form 1099-PATR.
(4)
Section 199A(g) deduction allocated to eligible taxpayer.
An eligible taxpayer may deduct the lesser of the section 199A(g) deduction identified on the notice described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section or the eligible taxpayer's taxable income in the taxable year in which the eligible taxpayer receives
the timely written notice described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For this purpose, the eligible taxpayer's taxable income is determined without taking into account the section 199A(g) deduction being passed through to the eligible taxpayer and after taking into account any section 199A(a) deduction allowed to the eligible taxpayer. Any section 199A(g) deduction the eligible taxpayer does not use in the taxable year in which the eligible taxpayer receives the notice (received on or before the due date of the Form 1099-PATR) is lost and cannot be carried forward or back to other taxable years. The taxable income limitation for the section 199A(a) deduction set forth in section 199A(b)(3) and § 1.199A-1(a) and (b) does not apply to limit the deductibility of the section 199A(g) deduction passed through to the eligible taxpayer.
(5)
Special rules for eligible taxpayers that are Specified Cooperatives.
Any Specified Cooperative that receives a section 199A(g) deduction as an eligible taxpayer can take the deduction against patronage gross income and related deductions to the extent it relates to its patronage gross income and related deductions. Only a patron that is an exempt Specified Cooperative may take a section 199A(g) deduction passed through from another Specified Cooperative if the deduction relates to the patron Specified Cooperative's nonpatronage gross income and related deductions.
(6)
W-2 wage limitation.
The W-2 wage limitation described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is applied at the cooperative level whether or not the Specified Cooperative chooses to pass through some or all of the section 199A(g) deduction. Any section 199A(g) deduction that has been passed through by a Specified Cooperative to an eligible taxpayer is not subject to the W-2 wage limitation a second time at the eligible taxpayer's level.
(7)
Specified Cooperative denied section 1382 deduction for portion of qualified payments.
A Specified Cooperative must reduce its section 1382 deduction by an amount equal to the portion of any qualified payment that is attributable to the Specified Cooperative's section 199A(g) deduction passed through. This means the Specified Cooperative must reduce its section 1382 deduction in an amount equal to the section 199A(g) deduction passed through.
(8)
No double counting.
A qualified payment received by a Specified Cooperative that is a patron of a Specified Cooperative is not taken into account by the patron for purposes of section 199A(g).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The examples of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A of the Code. Assume for each example that the Specified Cooperative sent all required notices to patrons on or before the due date of the Form 1099-PATR.
(1)
Example 1. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative calculating section 199A(g) deduction.
(i) C is a grain marketing nonexempt Specified Cooperative, with $5,250,000 in gross receipts during 2020 from the sale of grain grown by its patrons. C paid $4,000,000 to its patrons at the time the grain was delivered in the form of per-unit retain allocations and another $1,000,000 in patronage dividends after the close of the 2020 taxable year. C has other expenses of $250,000 during 2020, including $100,000 of W-2 wages.
(ii) C has DPGR of $5,250,000 and QPAI as defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(4)(ii) of $5,000,000 for 2020. C's section 199A(g) deduction is equal to the least of 9% of QPAI ($450,000), 9% of taxable income ($450,000), or 50% of W-2 wages ($50,000). C passes through the entire section 199A(g) deduction to its patrons. Accordingly, C reduces its $5,000,000 deduction allowable under section 1382(b) (relating to the $1,000,000 patronage dividends and $4,000,000 per-unit retain allocations) by $50,000.
(2)
Example 2. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative determines amounts included in QPAI and taxable income.
(i) C, a nonexempt Specified Cooperative, offers harvesting services and markets the grain of patrons and nonpatrons. C had gross receipts from harvesting services and grain sales, and expenses related to both. All of C's harvesting services were performed for their patrons, and 75% of the grain sales were for patrons.
(ii) C identifies 75% of the gross receipts and related expenses from grain
sales and 100% of the gross receipts and related expenses from the harvesting services as patronage sourced. C identifies 25% of the gross receipts and related expenses from grain sales as nonpatronage sourced.
(iii) C does not include any nonpatronage gross receipts or related expenses from grain sales in either QPAI or taxable income when calculating the section 199A(g) deduction. C's QPAI includes the patronage DPGR, less related expenses (allocable COGS, wages and other expenses). C's taxable income includes the patronage gross receipts, whether such gross receipts are DPGR or non-DPGR.
(iv) C allocates and reports patronage dividends to its harvesting patrons and grain marketing patrons. C also notifies its grain marketing patrons (in accordance with the requirements of § 1.199A-7(f)(3)) that their patronage dividends are qualified payments used in C's section 199A(g) computation. The patrons must use this information for purposes of computing their section 199A(b)(7) reduction to their section 199A(a) deduction (
see
§ 1.199A-7(f)).
(3)
Example 3. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative with patronage and nonpatronage gross receipts and related deductions.
(i) C, a nonexempt Specified Cooperative, markets corn grown by its patrons in the United States. For the calendar year ending December 31, 2020, C derives gross receipts from the marketing activity of $1,800. Such gross receipts qualify as DPGR. Assume C has $800 of expenses (including COGS, other expenses, and $400 of W-2 wages) properly allocable to DPGR, and a $1,000 deduction allowed under section 1382(b). C also derives gross receipts from nonpatronage sources in the amount of $500, and has nonpatronage deductions in the amount of $400 (including COGS, other expenses, and $100 of W-2 wages).
(ii) C does not include any gross receipts or deductions from nonpatronage sources when calculating the deduction under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. C's QPAI and taxable income both equal $1,000 ($1,800−800). C's deduction under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section for the taxable year is equal to $90 (9% of $1,000), which does not exceed $200 (50% of C's W-2 wages properly allocable to DPGR).C passes through $90 of the deduction to patrons and C reduces its section 1382(b) deduction by $90.
(4)
Example 4. Exempt Specified Cooperative with patronage and nonpatronage income and deductions.
(i) C, an exempt Specified Cooperative, markets corn MPGE by its patrons in the United States. For the calendar year ending December 31, 2020, C derives gross receipts from the marketing activity of $1,800. For this activity assume C has $800 of expenses (including COGS, other expenses, and $400 of W-2 wages) properly allocable to DPGR, and a $1,000 deduction under section 1382(b). C also derives gross receipts from nonpatronage sources in the amount of $500. Assume the gross receipts qualify as DPGR. For this activity assume C has $400 of expenses (including COGS, other expenses, and $20 of W-2 wages) properly allocable to DPGR and no deduction under section 1382(c).
(ii) C calculates two separate section 199A(g) deduction amounts. C's section 199A(g) deduction attributable to patronage sources is the same as the deduction calculated by the nonexempt Specified Cooperative in
Example 3
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(iii) C's nonpatronage QPAI and taxable income is equal to $100 ($500−$400). C's deduction under paragraph (c)(4) of this section that directs C to use paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section attributable to nonpatronage sources is equal to $9 (9% of $100), which does not exceed $10 (50% of C's W-2 wages properly allocable to DPGR). C cannot pass through any of the nonpatronage section 199A(g) deduction amount to its patrons.
(5)
Example 5. NOL.
(i) In 2021, E, a nonexempt Specified Cooperative that is not part of an EAG, generates QPAI and taxable income of $100 (without taking into account any section 1382(b) deductions, NOLs, or the section 199A(g) deduction). E pays out patronage dividends of $91 that are deductible under section 1382(b). E has an NOL carryover of $500 attributable to losses incurred prior to 2018. While taxable income and QPAI do not take into account the section 1382(b) deduction, taxable income does take into account NOLs. When calculating its section
199A(g) deduction, E must take into account the NOL carryover when calculating taxable income, unless the taxable income is the result of not taking into account any deduction allowable under section 1382(b). In this case $91 of taxable income is the result of not taking into account the deduction allowed under section 1382(b) and the remaining $9 should be reduced by the NOL carryover so that taxable income equals $91. E calculates a section 199A(g) deduction of $8.19 (.09 × $91 (which is the lesser of $100 QPAI or $91 taxable income)).
(ii) E may pass through the entire $8.19 of section 199A(g) deduction to patrons (which will reduce its section 1382(b) deduction from $91 to $82.81). However, if E does not pass the deduction through, paragraph (b)(6) of this section prohibits E from claiming any of the section 199A(g) deduction in 2021.
(iii) If E passes through the deduction to patrons, E's taxable income under section 172(b)(2) for NOL absorption purposes is $9 ($100−$82.81−$9 NOL−$8.19 section 199A(g) deduction). If E does not pass through the deduction, then E's taxable income under section 172(b)(2) for NOL absorption purposes is $9 ($100−$91−$9 NOL).
(iv) Assuming E passes through the deduction to patrons, E would use $9 of the NOL carryover and have a $491 NOL carryover remaining. To the extent E does not pass through the deduction, E would still use $9 of the NOL carryover and have a $491 NOL carryover remaining.
(6)
Example 6. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative not passing through the section 199A(g) deduction to patrons.
(i) D, a nonexempt Specified Cooperative, markets corn grown by its patrons within the United States. For its calendar year ended December 31, 2020, D has gross receipts of $1,500,000, all derived from the sale of corn grown by its patrons within the United States. D pays $300,000 for its patrons' corn at the time the grain was delivered in the form of per-unit retain allocations and its W-2 wages (as defined in § 1.199A-11) for 2020 total $300,000.D has no other costs. Patron A is a patron of D. Patron A is a cash basis taxpayer and files Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis. All corn grown by Patron A in 2020 is sold through D and Patron A is eligible to share in patronage dividends paid by D for that year.
(ii) All of D's gross receipts from the sale of its patrons' corn qualify as DPGR (as defined paragraph (8)(b)(3)(ii) of this section). D's QPAI and taxable income is $1,200,000. D's section 199A(g) deduction for its taxable year 2020 is $108,000 (.09 × $1,200,000). Because this amount is less than 50% of D's W-2 wages, the entire amount is allowed as a section 199A(g) deduction.D decides not to pass any of its section 199A(g) deduction to its patrons. The section 199A(g) deduction of $108,000 is applied to, and reduces, D's taxable income.
(7)
Example 7. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative passing through the section 199A(g) deduction to patrons paid a patronage dividend.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that D decides to pass its entire section 199A(g) deduction through to its patrons. D declares a patronage dividend for its 2020 taxable year of $900,000, which it pays on March 15, 2021.Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, D notifies patrons in written notices that accompany the patronage dividend notification that D is allocating to them the section 199A(g) deduction D is entitled to claim in the calendar year 2020.On March 15, 2021, Patron A receives a $9,000 patronage dividend that is a qualified payment under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section from D. In the notice that accompanies the patronage dividend, Patron A is designated a $1,080 section 199A(g) deduction. Under paragraph (a) of this section, Patron A may claim a $1,080 section 199A(g) deduction for the taxable year ending December 31, 2021, subject to the limitations set forth under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, D is required to reduce its section 1382 deduction of $1,200,000 by the $108,000 section 199A(g) deduction passed through to patrons (whether D pays patronage dividends on book or Federal income tax net earnings). As a consequence, D is entitled to a section 1382 deduction for the taxable year ending December 31, 2020, in the amount of $1,092,000 ($1,200,000−$108,000) and to a section 199A(g) deduction in the amount of $108,000 ($1,200,000 × .09).
(8)
Example 8. Nonexempt Specified Cooperative passing through the section 199A(g) deduction to patrons paid a patronage dividend and advances on expected patronage net earnings.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that D paid out $500,000 to its patrons as advances on expected patronage net earnings. In 2020, D pays its patrons a $400,000 ($900,000−$500,000 already paid) patronage dividend in cash or a combination of cash and qualified written notices of allocation. Under paragraph (d)(7) of this section and section 1382, D is allowed a deduction of $1,092,000 ($1,200,000−$108,000 section 199A(g) deduction), whether patronage net earnings are distributed on book or Federal income tax net earnings.
(ii) The patrons will have received a gross amount of $1,200,000 in qualified payments under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section from Cooperative D ($300,000 paid as per-unit retain allocations, $500,000 paid during the taxable year as advances, and the additional $400,000 paid as patronage dividends). If D passes through its entire section 199A(g) deduction to its patrons by providing the notice required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section, then the patrons will be allowed a $108,000 section 199A(g) deduction, resulting in a net $1,092,000 taxable distribution from D. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(8) of this section, any of the $1,200,000 received by patrons that are Specified Cooperatives from D is not taken into account for purposes of calculating the patrons' section 199A(g) deduction.Patrons that are not Specified Cooperatives must include those payments in the section 199A(b)(7) reduction when calculating a section 199A(a) deduction as applicable.
(9)
Example 9. Intangible property transaction as part of disposition of agricultural or horticultural products.
F, a Specified Cooperative, markets patrons' oranges by processing the oranges into orange juice, and then bottling and selling the orange juice to customers. F markets the orange juice under its own brand name, but F also licenses from G, an unrelated third party, the rights to use G's brand name on the bottled orange juice. F's gross receipts from the sale of both brands of orange juice qualify as DPGR, assuming all other requirements of this section are met.
(10)
Example 10. Intangible property transaction that is not a disposition of an agricultural or horticultural product.
H, a Specified Cooperative, licenses H's brand name to J, an unrelated third party. J purchases oranges, produces orange juice, and then bottles and sells the orange juice to customers. Gross receipts that H derives from the license of the brand name to J are not DPGR from the disposition of an agricultural or horticultural product.
(11)
Example 11. Allocation rules when Specified Cooperative retains the section 199A(g) deduction attributable to non-eligible taxpayers.
K, a Specified Cooperative, for the taxable year has $200 of taxable income and QPAI ($100 is attributable to business done for patrons that are C corporation patrons and $100 is attributable to business done for patrons that are eligible taxpayers). K calculates an $18 section 199A(g) deduction. K passes through $9 to its patrons that are eligible taxpayers, distributes $191 to patrons in distributions that are deductible under section 1382(b) (including patronage dividends that were paid out in the same amounts to C corporation patrons and eligible taxpayer patrons because the value of their business,$100 each, was the same), and adjusts its deduction under section 1382 by $9 (the amount of the section 199A(g) deduction passed through). K's taxable income after the section 199A deduction and distributions is $0.
(f)
Special rule for Specified Cooperative partners.
In the case described in section 199A(g)(5)(B), where a Specified Cooperative is a partner in a partnership, the partnership must separately identify and report on the Schedule K-1 of the Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income (or any successor form) issued to the Specified Cooperative partner the cooperative's share of gross receipts and related deductions, W-2 wages, and COGS, unless otherwise provided by the instructions to the Form. The Specified Cooperative partner determines what gross receipts reported by the partnership qualify as DPGR and includes these gross receipts and related deductions, W-2 wages, and COGS to calculate one section 199A(g) deduction (in the case of a nonexempt
Specified Cooperative) or two section 199A(g) deductions (in the case of an exempt Specified Cooperative) using the steps set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of determining whether gross receipts are DPGR, the MPGE activities of the Specified Cooperative partner may be attributed to the partnership, and the partnership's MPGE activities may be attributed to the Specified Cooperative partner.
(g)
Recapture of section 199A(g) deduction.
If the amount of the section 199A(g) deduction that was passed through to eligible taxpayers exceeds the amount allowable as a section 199A(g) deduction as determined on examination or reported on an amended return, then recapture of the excess will occur at the Specified Cooperative level in the taxable year the Specified Cooperative took the excess section 199A(g) deduction.
(h)
Applicability date.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.199A-7, the provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.199A-7 through 1.199A-12 for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.
[T.D. 9947, 86 FR 5569, Jan. 19, 2021, as amended by 87 FR 68899, Nov. 17, 2022]
§ 1.199A-9
Domestic production gross receipts.
(a)
Domestic production gross receipts
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The provisions of this section provide guidance to determine what gross receipts (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(2)(iii)) are domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(3)(ii)). DPGR does not include gross receipts derived from services or the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of land unless a de minimis or other exception applies. Partners, including partners in an EAG partnership described in § 1.199A-12(i)(1), may not treat guaranteed payments under section 707(c) as DPGR.
(2)
Application to marketing cooperatives.
For purposes of determining DPGR, a Specified Cooperative (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(2)) will be treated as having manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted (MPGE) (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) in whole or significant part (defined in paragraph (h) of this section) any agricultural or horticultural product (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(4)) within the United States (defined in paragraph (i) of this section) marketed by the Specified Cooperative which its patrons (defined in § 1.1388-1(e)) have so MPGE.
(b)
Related persons
—(1)
In general.
Pursuant to section 199A(g)(3)(D)(ii), DPGR does not include any gross receipts derived from agricultural or horticultural products leased, licensed, or rented by the Specified Cooperative for use by any related person. A person is treated as related to another person if both persons are treated as a single employer under either section 52(a) or (b) (without regard to section 1563(b)), or section 414(m) or (o). Any other person is an unrelated person for purposes of the section 199A(g) deduction.
(2)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gross receipts derived from any agricultural or horticultural product leased or rented by the Specified Cooperative to a related person may qualify as DPGR if the agricultural or horticultural product is held for sublease or rent, or is subleased or rented, by the related person to an unrelated person for the ultimate use of the unrelated person. Similarly, notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gross receipts derived from a license of the right to reproduce an agricultural or horticultural product to a related person for reproduction and sale, exchange, lease, or rental to an unrelated person for the ultimate use of the unrelated person are treated as gross receipts from a disposition of an agricultural or horticultural product and may qualify as DPGR.
(c)
Allocating gross receipts
—(1)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative must determine the portion of its gross receipts for the taxable year that is DPGR and the portion of its gross receipts that is non-DPGR using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances. Applicable Federal
income tax principles apply to determine whether a transaction is, in substance, a lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition the gross receipts of which may constitute DPGR, whether it is a service the gross receipts of which may constitute non-DPGR, or some combination thereof. For example, if a Specified Cooperative sells an agricultural or horticultural product and, in connection with that sale, also provides services, the Specified Cooperative must allocate its gross receipts from the transaction using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances that accurately identifies the gross receipts that constitute DPGR and non-DPGR in accordance with the requirements of § 1.199A-8(b) and/or (c). The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the portion of gross receipts for the taxable year that is DPGR and the portion of gross receipts that is non-DPGR. The books and records maintained for gross receipts must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (c)(1).
(2)
Reasonable method of allocation.
If a Specified Cooperative has the information readily available and can, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify whether the gross receipts are derived from an item (and thus, are DPGR), then the Specified Cooperative must use that specific identification to determine DPGR. If the Specified Cooperative does not have information readily available to specifically identify whether gross receipts are derived from an item or cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify whether gross receipts are derived from an item, then the Specified Cooperative is not required to use a method that specifically identifies whether the gross receipts are derived from an item but can use a reasonable allocation method. Factors taken into consideration in determining whether the Specified Cooperative's method of allocating gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR is reasonable include whether the Specified Cooperative uses the most accurate information available; the relationship between the gross receipts and the method used; the accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods; whether the method is used by the Specified Cooperative for internal management or other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or state income tax purposes; the time, burden, and cost of using alternative methods; and whether the Specified Cooperative applies the method consistently from year to year.
(3)
De minimis rules
—(i)
DPGR.
A Specified Cooperative's applicable gross receipts as provided in § 1.199A-8(b) and/or (c) may be treated as DPGR if less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are non-DPGR (after application of the exceptions provided in § 1.199A-9(j)(3)). If the amount of the Specified Cooperative's gross receipts that are non-DPGR equals or exceeds 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts, then, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Specified Cooperative is required to allocate all gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If a Specified Cooperative is a member of an expanded affiliated group (EAG) (defined in § 1.199A-12), but is not a member of a consolidated group, then the determination of whether less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the Specified Cooperative level. If a Specified Cooperative is a member of a consolidated group, then the determination of whether less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are non-DPGR is made at the consolidated group level.
See
§ 1.199A-12(d).
(ii)
Non-DPGR.
A Specified Cooperative's applicable gross receipts as provided in § 1.199A-8(b) and/or (c) may be treated as non-DPGR if less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are DPGR. If a Specified Cooperative is a member of an EAG, but is not a member of a consolidated group, then the determination of whether less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are DPGR is made at the Specified Cooperative level. If a Specified Cooperative is a member of a consolidated group, then the determination of
whether less than 10 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts are DPGR is made at the consolidated group level.
(d)
Use of historical data for multiple-year transactions.
If a Specified Cooperative recognizes and reports gross receipts from upfront payments or other similar payments on a Federal income tax return for a taxable year, then the Specified Cooperative's use of historical data in making an allocation of gross receipts from the transaction between DPGR and non-DPGR may constitute a reasonable method. If a Specified Cooperative makes allocations using historical data, and subsequently updates the data, then the Specified Cooperative must use the more recent or updated data, starting in the taxable year in which the update is made.
(e)
Determining DPGR item-by-item
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the section 199A(g) deduction, a Specified Cooperative determines, using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances, whether gross receipts qualify as DPGR on an item-by-item basis (and not, for example, on a division-by-division, product line-by-product line, or transaction-by-transaction basis). The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the portion of gross receipts that is DPGR. The books and records maintained for gross receipts must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (e)(1).
(i) The term
item
means the agricultural or horticultural product offered by the Specified Cooperative in the normal course of its trade or business for lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition (for purposes of this paragraph (e), collectively referred to as disposition) to customers, if the gross receipts from the disposition of such product qualify as DPGR; or
(ii) If paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to the product, then any component of the product described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is treated as the item, provided that the gross receipts from the disposition of the product described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are attributable to such component qualify as DPGR. Each component that meets the requirements under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) must be treated as a separate item and a component that meets the requirements under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) may not be combined with a component that does not meet these requirements.
(2)
Special rules.
(i) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, in no event may a single item consist of two or more products unless those products are offered for disposition, in the normal course of the Specified Cooperative's trade or business, as a single item (regardless of how the products are packaged).
(ii) In the case of agricultural or horticultural products customarily sold by weight or by volume, the item is determined using the most common custom of the industry (for example, barrels of oil).
(3)
Exception.
If the Specified Cooperative MPGE agricultural or horticultural products within the United States that it disposes of, and the Specified Cooperative leases, rents, licenses, purchases, or otherwise acquires property that contains or may contain the agricultural or horticultural products (or a portion thereof), and the Specified Cooperative cannot reasonably determine, without undue burden and expense, whether the acquired property contains any of the original agricultural or horticultural products MPGE by the Specified Cooperative, then the Specified Cooperative is not required to determine whether any portion of the acquired property qualifies as an item for purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Therefore, the gross receipts derived from the disposition of the acquired property may be treated as non-DPGR. Similarly, the preceding sentences apply if the Specified Cooperative can reasonably determine that the acquired property contains agricultural or horticultural products (or a portion thereof) MPGE by the Specified Cooperative, but cannot reasonably determine, without undue burden or expense, how much, or what type, grade, etc., of the agricultural or horticultural MPGE by the Specified Cooperative the acquired property contains.
(f)
Definition of manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted (MPGE)
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the term
MPGE
includes manufacturing, producing, growing, extracting, installing, developing, improving, and creating agricultural or horticultural products; making agricultural or horticultural products out of material by processing, manipulating, refining, or changing the form of an article, or by combining or assembling two or more articles; cultivating soil, raising livestock, and farming aquatic products. The term MPGE also includes storage, handling, or other processing activities (other than transportation activities) within the United States related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products only if the products are consumed in connection with or incorporated into the MPGE of agricultural or horticultural products, whether or not by the Specified Cooperative. The Specified Cooperative (or the patron if § 1.199A-9(a)(2) applies) must have the benefits and burdens of ownership of the agricultural or horticultural products under Federal income tax principles during the period the MPGE activity occurs for the gross receipts derived from the MPGE of the agricultural or horticultural products to qualify as DPGR.
(2)
Packaging, repackaging, or labeling.
If the Specified Cooperative packages, repackages, or labels agricultural or horticultural products and engages in no other MPGE activity with respect to those agricultural or horticultural products, the packaging, repackaging, or labeling does not qualify as MPGE with respect to those agricultural or horticultural products.
(3)
Installing.
If a Specified Cooperative installs agricultural or horticultural products and engages in no other MPGE activity with respect to the agricultural or horticultural products, the Specified Cooperative's installing activity does not qualify as an MPGE activity. Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(3)(i)(A) of this section, if the Specified Cooperative installs agricultural or horticultural products MPGE by the Specified Cooperative and the Specified Cooperative has the benefits and burdens of ownership of the agricultural or horticultural products under Federal income tax principles during the period the installing activity occurs, then the portion of the installing activity that relates to the agricultural or horticultural products is an MPGE activity.
(4)
Consistency with section 263A.
A Specified Cooperative that has MPGE agricultural or horticultural products for the taxable year must treat itself as a producer under section 263A with respect to the agricultural or horticultural products unless the Specified Cooperative is not subject to section 263A. A Specified Cooperative that currently is not properly accounting for its production activities under section 263A, and wishes to change its method of accounting to comply with the producer requirements of section 263A, must follow the applicable administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's consent to a change in accounting method (for further guidance, for example,
see
Rev. Proc. 2015-13, 2015-5 IRB 419, or any applicable subsequent guidance (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)).
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section.
(i)
Example 1. MPGE activities conducted within United States.
A, B, and C are unrelated persons. A is a Specified Cooperative, B is an individual patron of A, and C is a C corporation. B grows agricultural products outside of the United States and A markets those agricultural products for B. A stores the agricultural products in agricultural storage bins in the United States and has the benefits and burdens of ownership under Federal income tax principles of the agricultural products while they are being stored. A sells the agricultural products to C, who processes them into refined agricultural products in the United States. The gross receipts from A's activities are DPGR from the MPGE of agricultural products.
(ii)
Example 2. MPGE activities conducted within and outside United States.
The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that B grows the agricultural products outside the United States and
C processes them into refined agricultural products outside the United States. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the gross receipts derived by A from its sale of the agricultural products to C are DPGR from the MPGE of agricultural products within the United States.
(g)
By the taxpayer.
With respect to the exception of the rules applicable to an EAG and EAG partnerships under § 1.199A-12, only one Specified Cooperative may claim the section 199A(g) deduction with respect to any qualifying activity under paragraph (f) of this section performed in connection with the same agricultural or horticultural product. If an unrelated party performs a qualifying activity under paragraph (f) of this section pursuant to a contract with a Specified Cooperative (or its patron as relevant under paragraph (a)(2) of this section), then only if the Specified Cooperative (or its patron) has the benefits and burdens of ownership of the agricultural or horticultural product under Federal income tax principles during the period in which the qualifying activity occurs is the Specified Cooperative (or its patron) treated as engaging in the qualifying activity.
(h)
In whole or significant part defined
—(1)
In general.
Agricultural or horticultural products must be MPGE in whole or significant part by the Specified Cooperative (or its patrons in the case described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and in whole or significant part within the United States to qualify under section 199A(g)(3)(D)(i). If a Specified Cooperative enters into a contract with an unrelated person for the unrelated person to MPGE agricultural or horticultural products for the Specified Cooperative and the Specified Cooperative has the benefits and burdens of ownership of the agricultural or horticultural products under applicable Federal income tax principles during the period the MPGE activity occurs, then, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, the Specified Cooperative is considered to MPGE the agricultural or horticultural products under this section. The unrelated person must perform the MPGE activity on behalf of the Specified Cooperative in whole or significant part within the United States in order for the Specified Cooperative to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (h)(1).
(2)
Substantial in nature.
Agricultural or horticultural products will be treated as MPGE in whole or in significant part by the Specified Cooperative (or its patrons in the case described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) within the United States for purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section. However, MPGE of the agricultural or horticultural products by the Specified Cooperative within the United States must be substantial in nature taking into account all the facts and circumstances, including the relative value added by, and relative cost of, the Specified Cooperative's MPGE within the United States, the nature of the agricultural or horticultural products, and the nature of the MPGE activity that the Specified Cooperative performs within the United States. The MPGE of a key component of an agricultural or horticultural product does not, in itself, meet the substantial-in-nature requirement with respect to an agricultural or horticultural product under this paragraph (h)(2). In the case of an agricultural or horticultural product, research and experimental activities under section 174 and the creation of intangible assets are not taken into account in determining whether the MPGE of the agricultural or horticultural product is substantial in nature.
(3)
Safe harbor
—(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative (or its patrons in the case described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) will be treated as having MPGE an agricultural or horticultural product in whole or in significant part within the United States for purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section if the direct labor and overhead of such Specified Cooperative to MPGE the agricultural or horticultural product within the United States account for 20 percent or more of the Specified Cooperative's COGS of the agricultural or horticultural product, or in a transaction without COGS (for example, a lease, rental, or license), account for 20 percent or more of the Specified Cooperative's unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section) in property included in the
definition of agricultural or horticultural products. For Specified Cooperatives subject to section 263A, overhead is all costs required to be capitalized under section 263A except direct materials and direct labor. For Specified Cooperatives not subject to section 263A, overhead may be computed using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances, but may not include any cost, or amount of any cost, that would not be required to be capitalized under section 263A if the Specified Cooperative were subject to section 263A. Research and experimental expenditures under section 174 and the costs of creating intangible assets are not taken into account in determining direct labor or overhead for any agricultural or horticultural product. In the case of agricultural or horticultural products, research and experimental expenditures under section 174 and any other costs incurred in the creation of intangible assets may be excluded from COGS or unadjusted depreciable basis for purposes of determining whether the Specified Cooperative meets the safe harbor under this paragraph (h)(3). For Specified Cooperatives not subject to section 263A, the chosen reasonable method to compute overhead must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the Specified Cooperative's portion of overhead not subject to section 263A. The method must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for overhead must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (h)(3)(i).
(ii)
Unadjusted depreciable basis.
The term unadjusted depreciable basis means the basis of property for purposes of section 1011 without regard to any adjustments described in section 1016(a)(2) and (3). This basis does not reflect the reduction in basis for—
(A) Any portion of the basis the Specified Cooperative properly elects to treat as an expense under sections 179 or 179C; or
(B) Any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Code and the regulations under the Code (for example, a reduction in basis by the amount of the disabled access credit pursuant to section 44(d)(7)).
(4)
Special rules
—(i)
Contract with an unrelated person.
If a Specified Cooperative enters into a contract with an unrelated person for the unrelated person to MPGE an agricultural or horticultural product within the United States for the Specified Cooperative, and the Specified Cooperative is considered to MPGE the agricultural or horticultural product pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then, for purposes of the substantial-in-nature requirement under paragraph (h)(2) of this section and the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the Specified Cooperative's MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead must include both the Specified Cooperative's MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead to MPGE the agricultural or horticultural product within the United States as well as the MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead of the unrelated person to MPGE the agricultural or horticultural product within the United States under the contract.
(ii)
Aggregation.
In determining whether the substantial-in-nature requirement under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section is met at the time the Specified Cooperative disposes of an agricultural or horticultural product—
(A) An EAG member must take into account all the previous MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead of the other members of the EAG;
(B) An EAG partnership as defined in § 1.199A-12(i)(1) must take into account all of the previous MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead of all members of the EAG in which the partners of the EAG partnership are members (as well as the previous MPGE activities of any other EAG partnerships owned by members of the same EAG); and
(C) A member of an EAG in which the partners of an EAG partnership are members must take into account all of the previous MPGE activities or direct labor and overhead of the EAG partnership (as well as those of any other members of the EAG and any previous MPGE activities of any other EAG partnerships owned by members of the same EAG).
(i)
United States defined.
For purposes of section 199A(g), the term
United States
includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territorial waters of the United States, and the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to the territorial waters of the United States and over which the United States has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. Consistent with its definition in section 7701(a)(9), the term
United States
does not include possessions and territories of the United States or the airspace or space over the United States and these areas.
(j)
Derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Definition.
The term
derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition
is defined as, and limited to, the gross receipts directly derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products even if the Specified Cooperative has already recognized receipts from a previous lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the same agricultural or horticultural products. Applicable Federal income tax principles apply to determine whether a transaction is, in substance, a lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition, whether it is a service, or whether it is some combination thereof.
(ii)
Lease income.
The financing and interest components of a lease of agricultural or horticultural products are considered to be derived from the lease of such agricultural or horticultural products. However, any portion of the lease income that is attributable to services or non-qualified property as defined in paragraph (j)(3) of this section is not derived from the lease of agricultural or horticultural products.
(iii)
Income substitutes.
The proceeds from business interruption insurance, governmental subsidies, and governmental payments not to produce are treated as gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition to the extent they are substitutes for gross receipts that would qualify as DPGR.
(iv)
Exchange of property
—(A)
Taxable exchanges.
The value of property received by the Specified Cooperative in a taxable exchange of agricultural or horticultural products MPGE in whole or in significant part by the Specified Cooperative within the United States is DPGR for the Specified Cooperative (assuming all the other requirements of this section are met). However, unless the Specified Cooperative meets all of the requirements under this section with respect to any additional MPGE by the Specified Cooperative of the agricultural or horticultural products received in the taxable exchange, any gross receipts derived from the sale by the Specified Cooperative of the property received in the taxable exchange are non-DPGR, because the Specified Cooperative did not MPGE such property, even if the property was an agricultural or horticultural product in the hands of the other party to the transaction.
(B)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the gross receipts derived by the Specified Cooperative from the sale of eligible property (as defined in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section) received in a taxable exchange, net of any adjustments between the parties involved in the taxable exchange to account for differences in the eligible property exchanged (for example, location differentials and product differentials), may be treated as the value of the eligible property received by the Specified Cooperative in the taxable exchange. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxable exchange is deemed to occur on the date of the sale of the eligible property received in the taxable exchange by the Specified Cooperative, to the extent the sale occurs no later than the last day of the month following the month in which the exchanged eligible property is received by the Specified Cooperative. In addition, if the Specified Cooperative engages in any further MPGE activity with respect to the eligible property received in the taxable exchange, then, unless the Specified Cooperative meets the in-whole-or-in-significant-part requirement under paragraph (h)(1) of
this section with respect to the property sold, for purposes of this paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(B), the Specified Cooperative must also value the property sold without taking into account the gross receipts attributable to the further MPGE activity.
(C)
Eligible property.
For purposes of paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, eligible property is—
(
1
) Oil, natural gas, or petrochemicals, or products derived from oil, natural gas, or petrochemicals; or
(
2
) Any other property or product designated by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).
(
3
) For this purpose, the term
natural gas
includes only natural gas extracted from a natural deposit and does not include, for example, methane gas extracted from a landfill. In the case of natural gas, production activities include all activities involved in extracting natural gas from the ground and processing the gas into pipeline quality gas.
(2)
Hedging transactions
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, if a transaction is a hedging transaction within the meaning of section 1221(b)(2)(A) and § 1.1221-2(b), is properly identified as a hedging transaction in accordance with § 1.1221-2(f), and the risk being hedged relates to property described in section 1221(a)(1) that gives rise to DPGR or to property described in section 1221(a)(8) that is consumed in an activity that gives rise to DPGR, then—
(A) In the case of a hedge of purchases of property described in section 1221(a)(1), income, deduction, gain, or loss on the hedging transaction must be taken into account in determining COGS;
(B) In the case of a hedge of sales of property described in section 1221(a)(1), income, deduction, gain, or loss on the hedging transaction must be taken into account in determining DPGR; and
(C) In the case of a hedge of purchases of property described in section 1221(a)(8), income, deduction, gain, or loss on the hedging transaction must be taken into account in determining DPGR.
(ii)
Allocation.
The income, deduction, gain and loss from hedging transactions described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section must be allocated between the patronage and nonpatronage (defined in § 1.1388-1(f)) sourced income and related deductions of the Specified Cooperatives consistent with the cooperative's method for determining patronage and nonpatronage income and deductions.
(iii)
Effect of identification and nonidentification.
The principles of § 1.1221-2(g) apply to a Specified Cooperative that identifies or fails to identify a transaction as a hedging transaction, except that the consequence of identifying as a hedging transaction a transaction that is not in fact a hedging transaction described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, or of failing to identify a transaction that the Specified Cooperative has no reasonable grounds for treating as other than a hedging transaction described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, is that deduction or loss (but not income or gain) from the transaction is taken into account under paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
(iv)
Other rules.
See § 1.1221-2(e) for rules applicable to hedging by members of a consolidated group and § 1.446-4 for rules regarding the timing of income, deductions, gains or losses with respect to hedging transactions.
(3)
Allocation of gross receipts to embedded services and non-qualified property
—(i)
Embedded services and non-qualified property
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section, gross receipts derived from the performance of services do not qualify as DPGR. In the case of an embedded service, that is, a service the price of which, in the normal course of the business, is not separately stated from the amount charged for the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products, DPGR includes only the gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products (assuming all the other requirements of this section
are met) and not any receipts attributable to the embedded service. In addition, DPGR does not include gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of property that does not meet all of the requirements under this section (non-qualified property). The allocation of the gross receipts attributable to the embedded services or non-qualified property will be deemed to be reasonable if the allocation reflects the fair market value of the embedded services or non-qualified property.
(B)
Exceptions.
There are five exceptions to the rules under paragraph (j)(3)(i)(A) of this section regarding embedded services and non-qualified property. A Specified Cooperative may include in DPGR, if all the other requirements of this section are met with respect to the underlying item of agricultural or horticultural products to which the embedded services or non-qualified property relate, the gross receipts derived from—
(
1
) A qualified warranty, that is, a warranty that is provided in connection with the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products if, in the normal course of the Specified Cooperative's business—
(
i
)The price for the warranty is not separately stated from the amount charged for the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products; and
(
ii
) The warranty is neither separately offered by the Specified Cooperative nor separately bargained for with customers (that is, a customer cannot purchase the agricultural or horticultural products without the warranty).
2
) A qualified delivery, that is, a delivery or distribution service that is provided in connection with the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products if, in the normal course of the Specified Cooperative's business—
(
i
) The price for the delivery or distribution service is not separately stated from the amount charged for the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products; and
(
ii
) The delivery or distribution service is neither separately offered by the Specified Cooperative nor separately bargained for with customers (that is, a customer cannot purchase the agricultural or horticultural products without the delivery or distribution service).
(
3
) A qualified operating manual, that is, a manual of instructions that is provided in connection with the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products if, in the normal course of the Specified Cooperative's business—
(
i
) The price for the manual is not separately stated from the amount charged for the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products;
(
ii
) The manual is neither separately offered by the Specified Cooperative nor separately bargained for with customers (that is, a customer cannot purchase the agricultural or horticultural products without the manual); and
(
iii
) The manual is not provided in connection with a training course for customers.
(
4
) A qualified installation, that is, an installation service for agricultural or horticultural products that is provided in connection with the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products if, in the normal course of the Specified Cooperative's business—
(
i
) The price for the installation service is not separately stated from the amount charged for the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the agricultural or horticultural products; and
(
ii
) The installation is neither separately offered by the Specified Cooperative nor separately bargained for with customers (that is, a customer cannot purchase the agricultural or horticultural products without the installation service).
(
5
) A
de minimis
amount of gross receipts from embedded services and non-qualified property for each item of agricultural or horticultural products
may qualify. For purposes of this exception, a
de minimis
amount of gross receipts from embedded services and non-qualified property is less than 5 percent of the total gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of each item of agricultural or horticultural products. In the case of gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products that are received over a period of time (for example, a multi-year lease or installment sale), this
de minimis
exception is applied by taking into account the total gross receipts for the entire period derived (and to be derived) from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the item of agricultural or horticultural products. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if a Specified Cooperative treats gross receipts as DPGR under this
de minimis
exception, then the Specified Cooperative must treat the gross receipts recognized in each taxable year consistently as DPGR. The gross receipts that the Specified Cooperative treats as DPGR under paragraphs (j)(3)(i)(B)(1) through (4) of this section are treated as DPGR for purposes of applying this
de minimis
exception. This
de minimis
exception does not apply if the price of a service or non-qualified property is separately stated by the Specified Cooperative, or if the service or non-qualified property is separately offered or separately bargained for with the customer (that is, the customer can purchase the agricultural or horticultural products without the service or non-qualified property).
(ii)
Non-DPGR.
Applicable gross receipts as provided in §§ 1.199A-8(b) and/or (c) derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange or other disposition of an item of agricultural or horticultural products may be treated as non-DPGR if less than 5 percent of the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange or other disposition of that item are DPGR (taking into account embedded services and non-qualified property included in such disposition, but not part of the item). In the case of gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of agricultural or horticultural products that are received over a period of time (for example, a multi-year lease or installment sale), this paragraph (j)(5)(ii) is applied by taking into account the total gross receipts for the entire period derived (and to be derived) from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of the item of agricultural or horticultural products. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the Specified Cooperative treats gross receipts as non-DPGR under this
de minimis
exception, then the Specified Cooperative must treat the gross receipts recognized in each taxable year consistently as non-DPGR.
(k)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.199A-7 through 1.199A-12 for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.
[T.D. 9947, 86 FR 5569, Jan. 19, 2021, as amended by 87 FR 68899, Nov. 17, 2022]
§ 1.199A-10
Allocation of cost of goods sold (COGS) and other deductions to domestic production gross receipts (DPGR), and other rules.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The provisions of this section provide additional guidance on determining qualified production activities income (QPAI) as described and defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(4)(ii).
(b)
COGS allocable to DPGR
—(1)
In general.
When determining its QPAI, the Specified Cooperative (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(2)) must subtract from its DPGR (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(3)(ii)) the COGS allocable to its DPGR. The Specified Cooperative determines its COGS allocable to DPGR in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1) or, if applicable, paragraph (f) of this section. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition of inventory, COGS is equal to beginning inventory of the Specified Cooperative plus purchases and production costs incurred during the taxable year and included in inventory costs by
the Specified Cooperative, less ending inventory of the Specified Cooperative. In determining its QPAI, the Specified Cooperative does not include in COGS any payment made, whether during the taxable year, or included in beginning inventory, for which a deduction is allowed under section 1382(b) and/or (c), as applicable.
See
§ 1.199A-8(b)(4)(ii)(C). COGS is determined under the methods of accounting that the Specified Cooperative uses to compute taxable income.
See
sections 263A, 471, and 472. If section 263A requires the Specified Cooperative to include additional section 263A costs (as defined in § 1.263A-1(d)(3)) in inventory, additional section 263A costs must be included in determining COGS. COGS also include the Specified Cooperative's inventory valuation adjustments such as write-downs under the lower of cost or market method. In the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition (including, for example, theft, casualty, or abandonment) by the Specified Cooperative of non-inventory property, COGS for purposes of this section includes the adjusted basis of the property.
(2)
Allocating COGS
—(i)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative must use a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances to allocate COGS between DPGR and non-DPGR. Whether an allocation method is reasonable is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the Specified Cooperative uses the most accurate information available; the relationship between COGS and the method used; the accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods; whether the method is used by the Specified Cooperative for internal management or other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or state income tax purposes; the availability of costing information; the time, burden, and cost of using alternative methods; and whether the Specified Cooperative applies the method consistently from year to year. Depending on the facts and circumstances, reasonable methods may include methods based on gross receipts (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(2)(iii)), number of units sold, number of units produced, or total production costs. Ordinarily, if a Specified Cooperative uses a method to allocate gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR, then the use of a different method to allocate COGS that is not demonstrably more accurate than the method used to allocate gross receipts will not be considered reasonable. However, if a Specified Cooperative has information readily available to specifically identify COGS allocable to DPGR and can specifically identify that amount without undue burden or expense, COGS allocable to DPGR is that amount irrespective of whether the Specified Cooperative uses another allocation method to allocate gross receipts between DPGR and non-DPGR. A Specified Cooperative that does not have information readily available to specifically identify COGS allocable to DPGR and that cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify that amount is not required to use a method that specifically identifies COGS allocable to DPGR. The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the portion of COGS between DPGR and non-DPGR. The method must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for COGS must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (b)(2).
(ii)
Gross receipts recognized in an earlier taxable year.
If the Specified Cooperative (other than a Specified Cooperative that uses the small business simplified overall method of paragraph (f) of this section) recognizes and reports gross receipts on a Federal income tax return for a taxable year, and incurs COGS related to such gross receipts in a subsequent taxable year, then regardless of whether the gross receipts ultimately qualify as DPGR, the Specified Cooperative must allocate the COGS to—
(A) DPGR if the Specified Cooperative identified the related gross receipts as DPGR in the prior taxable year; or
(B) Non-DPGR if the Specified Cooperative identified the related gross receipts as non-DPGR in the prior taxable year or if the Specified Cooperative recognized under the Specified Cooperative's methods of accounting
those gross receipts in a taxable year to which section 199A(g) does not apply.
(iii)
COGS associated with activities undertaken in an earlier taxable year
—(A)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative must allocate its COGS between DPGR and non-DPGR under the rules provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, regardless of whether certain costs included in its COGS can be associated with activities undertaken in an earlier taxable year (including a year prior to the effective date of section 199A(g)). A Specified Cooperative may not segregate its COGS into component costs and allocate those component costs between DPGR and non-DPGR.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates an application of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
(
1
)
Example 1.
During the 2020 taxable year, nonexempt Specified Cooperative X grew and sold Horticultural Product A. All of the patronage gross receipts from sales recognized by X in 2020 were from the sale of Horticultural Product A and qualified as DPGR. Employee 1 of X was involved in X's production process until he retired in 2013. In 2020, X paid $30 directly from its general assets for Employee 1's medical expenses pursuant to an unfunded, self-insured plan for retired X employees. For purposes of computing X's 2020 taxable income, X capitalized those medical costs to inventory under section 263A. In 2020, the COGS for a unit of Horticultural Product A was $100 (including the applicable portion of the $30 paid for Employee 1's medical costs that was allocated to COGS under X's allocation method for additional section 263A costs). X has information readily available to specifically identify COGS allocable to DPGR and can identify that amount without undue burden and expense because all of X's gross receipts from sales in 2020 are attributable to the sale of Horticultural Product A and qualify as DPGR. The inventory cost of each unit of Horticultural Product A sold in 2020, including the applicable portion of retiree medical costs, is related to X's gross receipts from the sale of Horticultural Product A in 2020. X may not segregate the 2020 COGS by separately allocating the retiree medical costs, which are components of COGS, to DPGR and non-DPGR. Thus, even though the retiree medical costs can be associated with activities undertaken in prior years, $100 of inventory cost of each unit of Horticultural Product A sold in 2020, including the applicable portion of the retiree medical expense cost component, is allocable to DPGR in 2020.
(3)
Special allocation rules.
Section 199A(g)(3)(C) provides the following two special rules—
(i) For purposes of determining the COGS that are allocable to DPGR, any item or service brought into the United States (defined in § 1.199A-9(i)) is treated as acquired by purchase, and its cost is treated as not less than its value immediately after it entered the United States. A similar rule applies in determining the adjusted basis of leased or rented property where the lease or rental gives rise to DPGR.
(ii) In the case of any property described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section that has been exported by the Specified Cooperative for further manufacture, the increase in cost or adjusted basis under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section cannot exceed the difference between the value of the property when exported and the value of the property when brought back into the United States after the further manufacture. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the value of property is its customs value as defined in section 1059A(b)(1).
(4)
Rules for inventories valued at market or bona fide selling prices.
If part of COGS is attributable to the Specified Cooperative's inventory valuation adjustments, then COGS allocable to DPGR includes inventory adjustments to agricultural or horticultural products that are MPGE in whole or significant part within the United States. Accordingly, a Specified Cooperative that values its inventory under § 1.471-4 (inventories at cost or market, whichever is lower) or § 1.471-2(c) (subnormal goods at bona fide selling prices) must allocate a proper share of such adjustments (for example, write-downs) to DPGR based on a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances. Factors taken into account in determining whether the
method is reasonable include whether the Specified Cooperative uses the most accurate information available; the relationship between the adjustment and the allocation base chosen; the accuracy of the method chosen as compared with other possible methods; whether the method is used by the Specified Cooperative for internal management or other business purposes; whether the method is used for other Federal or state income tax purposes; the time, burden, and cost of using alternative methods; and whether the Specified Cooperative applies the method consistently from year to year. If the Specified Cooperative has information readily available to specifically identify the proper amount of inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR, then the Specified Cooperative must allocate that amount to DPGR. The Specified Cooperative that does not have information readily available to specifically identify the proper amount of its inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR and that cannot, without undue burden or expense, specifically identify the proper amount of its inventory valuation adjustments allocable to DPGR, is not required to use a method that specifically identifies inventory valuation adjustments to DPGR. The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect inventory adjustments. The method must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for inventory adjustments must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (b)(4).
(5)
Rules applicable to inventories accounted for under the last-in, first-out inventory method
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(5) applies to inventories accounted for using the specific goods last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the dollar-value LIFO method. Whenever a specific goods grouping or a dollar-value pool contains agricultural or horticultural products that produce DPGR and goods that do not, the Specified Cooperative must allocate COGS attributable to that grouping or pool between DPGR and non-DPGR using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances. Whether a method of allocating COGS between DPGR and non-DPGR is reasonable must be determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, this paragraph (b)(5) provides methods that a Specified Cooperative may use to allocate COGS for a Specified Cooperative's inventories accounted for using the LIFO method. If the Specified Cooperative uses the LIFO/FIFO ratio method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section or the change in relative base-year cost method provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, then the Specified Cooperative must use that method for all of the Specified Cooperative's inventory accounted for under the LIFO method. The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the inventory method. The method must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for the inventory method must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (b)(5).
(ii)
LIFO/FIFO ratio method.
The LIFO/FIFO ratio method is applied with respect to the LIFO inventory on a grouping-by-grouping or pool-by-pool basis. Under the LIFO/FIFO ratio method, a Specified Cooperative computes the COGS of a grouping or pool allocable to DPGR by multiplying the COGS of agricultural or horticultural products (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(4)) in the grouping or pool that produced DPGR computed using the FIFO method by the LIFO/FIFO ratio of the grouping or pool. The LIFO/FIFO ratio of a grouping or pool is equal to the total COGS of the grouping or pool computed using the LIFO method over the total COGS of the grouping or pool computed using the FIFO method.
(iii)
Change in relative base-year cost method.
A Specified Cooperative using the dollar-value LIFO method may use the change in relative base-year cost method. The change in relative base-year cost method for a Specified Cooperative using the dollar-value LIFO method is applied to all LIFO inventory on a pool-by-pool basis. The change in relative base-year cost method determines the COGS allocable to
DPGR by increasing or decreasing the total production costs (section 471 costs and additional section 263A costs) of agricultural or horticultural products that generate DPGR by a portion of any increment or liquidation of the dollar-value pool. The portion of an increment or liquidation allocable to DPGR is determined by multiplying the LIFO value of the increment or liquidation (expressed as a positive number) by the ratio of the change in total base-year cost (expressed as a positive number) of agricultural or horticultural products that will generate DPGR in ending inventory to the change in total base-year cost (expressed as a positive number) of all goods in ending inventory. The portion of an increment or liquidation allocable to DPGR may be zero but cannot exceed the amount of the increment or liquidation. Thus, a ratio in excess of 1.0 must be treated as 1.0.
(6)
Specified Cooperative using a simplified method for additional section 263A costs to ending inventory.
A Specified Cooperative that uses a simplified method specifically described in the section 263A regulations to allocate additional section 263A costs to ending inventory must follow the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to determine the amount of additional section 263A costs allocable to DPGR. Allocable additional section 263A costs include additional section 263A costs included in the Specified Cooperative's beginning inventory as well as additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year by the Specified Cooperative. Ordinarily, if the Specified Cooperative uses a simplified method specifically described in the section 263A regulations to allocate its additional section 263A costs to its ending inventory, the additional section 263A costs must be allocated in the same proportion as section 471 costs are allocated.
(c)
Other deductions properly allocable to DPGR or gross income attributable to DPGR
—(1)
In general.
In determining its QPAI, the Specified Cooperative must subtract from its DPGR (in addition to the COGS), the deductions that are properly allocable and apportioned to DPGR. A Specified Cooperative generally must allocate and apportion these deductions using the rules of the section 861 method provided in paragraph (d) of this section. In lieu of the section 861 method, an eligible Specified Cooperative may apportion these deductions using the simplified deduction method provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides a small business simplified overall method that may be used by a qualifying small Specified Cooperative. A Specified Cooperative using the simplified deduction method or the small business simplified overall method must use that method for all deductions. A Specified Cooperative eligible to use the small business simplified overall method may choose at any time for any taxable year to use the small business simplified overall method or the simplified deduction method for a taxable year.
(2)
Treatment of net operating losses.
A deduction under section 172 for a net operating loss (NOL) is not allocated or apportioned to DPGR or gross income attributable to DPGR.
(3)
W-2 wages.
Although only W-2 wages as described in § 1.199A-11 are taken into account in computing the W-2 wage limitation, all wages paid (or incurred in the case of an accrual method taxpayer) in the taxable year are taken into account in computing QPAI for that taxable year.
(d)
Section 861 method.
Under the section 861 method, the Specified Cooperative must allocate and apportion its deductions using the allocation and apportionment rules provided under the section 861 regulations under which section 199A(g) is treated as an operative section described in § 1.861-8(f). Accordingly, the Specified Cooperative applies the rules of the section 861 regulations to allocate and apportion deductions (including, if applicable, its distributive share of deductions from passthrough entities) to gross income attributable to DPGR. If the Specified Cooperative applies the allocation and apportionment rules of the section 861 regulations for section 199A(g) and another operative section, then the Specified Cooperative must use the same method of allocation and the same principles of apportionment for purposes of all operative sections. Research and experimental expenditures
must be allocated and apportioned in accordance with § 1.861-17 without taking into account the exclusive apportionment rule of § 1.861-17(b). Deductions for charitable contributions (as allowed under section 170 and section 873(b)(2) or 882(c)(1)(B)) must be ratably apportioned between gross income attributable to DPGR and gross income attributable to non-DPGR based on the relative amounts of gross income.
(e)
Simplified deduction method
—(1)
In general.
An eligible Specified Cooperative (defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) may use the simplified deduction method to apportion business deductions between DPGR and non-DPGR. The simplified deduction method does not apply to COGS. Under the simplified deduction method, the business deductions (except the NOL deduction) are ratably apportioned between DPGR and non-DPGR based on relative gross receipts. Accordingly, the amount of deductions for the current taxable year apportioned to DPGR is equal to the proportion of the total business deductions for the current taxable year that the amount of DPGR bears to total gross receipts.
(2)
Eligible Specified Cooperative.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), an eligible Specified Cooperative is—
(i) A Specified Cooperative that has average annual total gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) of $100,000,000 or less; or
(ii) A Specified Cooperative that has total assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) of $10,000,000 or less.
(3)
Total assets.
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the simplified deduction method, total assets mean the total assets the Specified Cooperative has at the end of the taxable year.
(ii)
Members of an expanded affiliated group.
To compute the total assets of an
expanded affiliated group
(EAG) at the end of the taxable year, the total assets at the end of the taxable year of each member of the EAG at the end of the taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the computing member (as described in § 1.199A-12(g)) are aggregated.
(4)
Members of an expanded affiliated group
—(i)
In general.
Whether the members of an EAG may use the simplified deduction method is determined by reference to all the members of the EAG. If the average annual gross receipts of the EAG are less than or equal to $100,000,000 or the total assets of the EAG are less than or equal to $10,000,000, then each member of the EAG may individually determine whether to use the simplified deduction method, regardless of the cost allocation method used by the other members.
(ii)
Exception.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, all members of the same consolidated group must use the same cost allocation method.
(f)
Small business simplified overall method
—(1)
In general.
A qualifying small Specified Cooperative may use the small business simplified overall method to apportion COGS and deductions between DPGR and non-DPGR. Under the small business simplified overall method, a Specified Cooperative's total costs for the current taxable year (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) are apportioned between DPGR and non-DPGR based on relative gross receipts. Accordingly, the amount of total costs for the current taxable year apportioned to DPGR is equal to the proportion of total costs for the current taxable year that the amount of DPGR bears to total gross receipts.
(2)
Qualifying small Specified Cooperative.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a qualifying small Specified Cooperative is a Specified Cooperative that has average annual total gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) of $25,000,000 or less.
(3)
Total costs for the current taxable year.
For purposes of the small business simplified overall method, total costs for the current taxable year means the total COGS and deductions for the current taxable year. Total costs for the current taxable year are determined under the methods of accounting that the Specified Cooperative uses to compute taxable income.
(4)
Members of an expanded affiliated group
—(i)
In general.
Whether the members of an EAG may use the small business simplified overall method is determined by reference to all the members of the EAG. If the average annual gross
receipts of the EAG are less than or equal to $25,000,000 then each member of the EAG may individually determine whether to use the small business simplified overall method, regardless of the cost allocation method used by the other members.
(ii)
Exception.
Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, all members of the same consolidated group must use the same cost allocation method.
(g)
Average annual gross receipts
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the simplified deduction method and the small business simplified overall method, average annual gross receipts means the average annual gross receipts of the Specified Cooperative for the 3 taxable years (or, if fewer, the taxable years during which the taxpayer was in existence) preceding the current taxable year, even if one or more of such taxable years began before the effective date of section 199A(g). In the case of any taxable year of less than 12 months (a short taxable year), the gross receipts of the Specified Cooperative are annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period.
(2)
Members of an expanded affiliated group
—(i)
In general.
To compute the average annual gross receipts of an EAG, the gross receipts for the entire taxable year of each member that is a member of the EAG at the end of its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year are aggregated. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), a consolidated group is treated as one member of an EAG.
(ii)
Exception.
Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, all members of the same consolidated group must use the same cost allocation method.
(h)
Cost allocation methods for determining oil-related QPAI
—(1)
Section 861 method.
A Specified Cooperative that uses the section 861 method to determine deductions that are allocated and apportioned to gross income attributable to DPGR must use the section 861 method to determine deductions that are allocated and apportioned to gross income attributable to oil-related DPGR.
(2)
Simplified deduction method.
A Specified Cooperative that uses the simplified deduction method to apportion deductions between DPGR and non-DPGR must determine the portion of deductions allocable to oil-related DPGR by multiplying the deductions allocable to DPGR by the ratio of oil-related DPGR to DPGR from all activities.
(3)
Small business simplified overall method.
A Specified Cooperative that uses the small business simplified overall method to apportion total costs (COGS and deductions) between DPGR and non-DPGR must determine the portion of total costs allocable to oil-related DPGR by multiplying the total costs allocable to DPGR by the ratio of oil-related DPGR to DPGR from all activities.
(i)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.199A-7 through 1.199A-12 for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.
[T.D. 9947, 86 FR 5569, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.199A-11
Wage limitation for the section 199A(g) deduction.
(a)
Rules of application
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The provisions of this section provide guidance on determining the W-2 wage limitation as defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(5)(ii)(B). Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or any subsequent form or document used in determining the amount of W-2 wages, are those issued for the calendar year ending during the taxable year of the Specified Cooperative (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(2)) for wages paid to employees (or former employees) of the Specified Cooperative for employment by the Specified Cooperative. Employees are limited to employees defined in section 3121(d)(1) and (2) (that is, officers of a corporate taxpayer and employees of the taxpayer
under the common law rules). See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for the requirement that W-2 wages must have been included in a return filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA) within 60 days after the due date (including extensions) of the return.
See also
section 199A(a)(4)(C).
(2)
Wage limitation for section 199A(g) deduction.
The amount of the deduction allowable under section 199A(g) to the Specified Cooperative for any taxable year cannot exceed 50 percent of the W-2 wages (as defined in section 199A(g)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (b) of this section) for the taxable year that are attributable to domestic production gross receipts (DPGR), defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(3)(ii), of agricultural or horticultural products defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(4).
(3)
Wages paid by entity other than common law employer.
In determining W-2 wages, the Specified Cooperative may take into account any W-2 wages paid by another entity and reported by the other entity on Forms W-2 with the other entity as the employer listed in Box c of the Forms W-2, provided that the W-2 wages were paid to common law employees or officers of the Specified Cooperative for employment by the Specified Cooperative. In such cases, the entity paying the W-2 wages and reporting the W-2 wages on Forms W-2 is precluded from taking into account such wages for purposes of determining W-2 wages with respect to that entity. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4), entities that pay and report W-2 wages on behalf of or with respect to other taxpayers can include, but are not limited to, certified professional employer organizations under section 7705, statutory employers under section 3401(d)(1), and agents under section 3504.
(4)
Requirement that wages must be reported on return filed with the Social Security Administration
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to section 199A(g)(1)(B)(ii) and section 199A(b)(4)(C), the term W-2 wages does not include any amount that is not properly included in a return filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for such return. Under § 31.6051-2 of this chapter, each Form W-2 and the transmittal Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements, together constitute an information return to be filed with SSA. Similarly, each Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, and the transmittal Form W-3 or W-3c, Transmittal of Corrected Wage and Tax Statements, together constitute an information return to be filed with SSA. In determining whether any amount has been properly included in a return filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for such return, each Form W-2 together with its accompanying Form W-3 is considered a separate information return and each Form W-2c together with its accompanying Form W-3 or Form W-3c is considered a separate information return. Section 6071(c) provides that Forms W-2 and W-3 must be filed on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which such returns relate (but see the special rule in § 31.6071(a)-1T(a)(3)(1) of this chapter for monthly returns filed under § 31.6011(a)-5(a) of this chapter). Corrected Forms W-2 are required to be filed with SSA on or before January 31 of the year following the year in which the correction is made.
(ii)
Corrected return filed to correct a return that was filed within 60 days of the due date.
If a corrected information return (Return B) is filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return B to correct an information return (Return A) that was filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the information return (Return A) and paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section does not apply, then the wage information on Return B must be included in determining W-2 wages. If a corrected information return (Return D) is filed with SSA later than the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return D to correct an information return (Return C) that was filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the information return (Return C), then if Return D reports an increase (or increases) in wages included in determining W-2 wages from the wage amounts reported on Return C, such increase (or increases) on Return D is disregarded in
determining W-2 wages (and only the wage amounts on Return C may be included in determining W-2 wages). If Return D reports a decrease (or decreases) in wages included in determining W-2 wages from the amounts reported on Return C, then, in determining W-2 wages, the wages reported on Return C must be reduced by the decrease (or decreases) reflected on Return D.
(iii)
Corrected return filed to correct a return that was filed later than 60 days after the due date.
If an information return (Return F) is filed to correct an information return (Return E) that was not filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return E, then Return F (and any subsequent information returns filed with respect to Return E) will not be considered filed on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of Return F (or the subsequent corrected information return). Thus, if a Form W-2c is filed to correct a Form W-2 that was not filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the Form W-2 (or to correct a Form W-2c relating to a Form W-2 that had not been filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) of the Form W-2), then this Form W-2c is not to be considered to have been filed with SSA on or before the 60th day after the due date (including extensions) for this Form W-2c, regardless of when the Form W-2c is filed.
(b)
Definition of W-2 wages
—(1)
In general.
Section 199A(g)(1)(B)(ii) provides that the W-2 wages of the Specified Cooperative must be determined in the same manner as under section 199A(b)(4) (without regard to section 199A(b)(4)(B) and after application of section 199A(b)(5)). Section 199A(b)(4)(A) provides that the term W-2 wages means with respect to any person for any taxable year of such person, the amounts described in paragraphs (3) and (8) of section 6051(a) paid by such person with respect to employment of employees by such person during the calendar year ending during such taxable year. Thus, the term W-2 wages includes the total amount of wages as defined in section 3401(a); the total amount of elective deferrals (within the meaning of section 402(g)(3)); the compensation deferred under section 457; and the amount of designated Roth contributions (as defined in section 402A).
(2)
Section 199A(g) deduction.
Pursuant to section 199A(g)(3)(A), W-2 wages do not include any amount which is not properly allocable to DPGR for purposes of calculating qualified production activities income (QPAI) as defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(4)(ii). The Specified Cooperative may determine the amount of wages that is properly allocable to DPGR using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances. The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the wages allocable to DPGR for purposes of QPAI. The books and records maintained for wages allocable to DPGR for purposes of QPAI must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (b)(2).
(c)
Methods for calculating W-2 wages.
The Secretary may provide for methods that may be used in calculating W-2 wages, including W-2 wages for short taxable years by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).
(d)
Wage limitation—acquisitions, dispositions, and short taxable years
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of computing the deduction under section 199A(g) of the Specified Cooperative, in the case of an acquisition or disposition (as defined in section 199A(b)(5) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section) that causes more than one Specified Cooperative to be an employer of the employees of the acquired or disposed of Specified Cooperative during the calendar year, the W-2 wages of the Specified Cooperative for the calendar year of the acquisition or disposition are allocated between or among each Specified Cooperative based on the period during which the employees of the acquired or disposed of Specified Cooperatives were employed by the Specified Cooperative, regardless of which permissible method is used for reporting predecessor and successor wages on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.
(2)
Short taxable year that does not include December 31.
If the Specified Cooperative has a short taxable year that does not contain a calendar year ending during such short taxable year, wages paid to employees for employment by the Specified Cooperative during the short taxable year are treated as W-2 wages for such short taxable year for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section (if the wages would otherwise meet the requirements to be W-2 wages under this section but for the requirement that a calendar year must end during the short taxable year).
(3)
Acquisition or disposition.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the terms
acquisition
and
disposition
include an incorporation, a liquidation, a reorganization, or a purchase or sale of assets.
(e)
Application in the case of a Specified Cooperative with a short taxable year.
In the case of a Specified Cooperative with a short taxable year, subject to the rules of paragraph (a) of this section, the W-2 wages of the Specified Cooperative for the short taxable year can include only those wages paid during the short taxable year to employees of the Specified Cooperative, only those elective deferrals (within the meaning of section 402(g)(3)) made during the short taxable year by employees of the Specified Cooperative, and only compensation actually deferred under section 457 during the short taxable year with respect to employees of the Specified Cooperative.
(f)
Non-duplication rule.
Amounts that are treated as W-2 wages for a taxable year under any method cannot be treated as W-2 wages of any other taxable year. Also, an amount cannot be treated as W-2 wages by more than one taxpayer. Finally, an amount cannot be treated as W-2 wages by the Specified Cooperative both in determining patronage and nonpatronage W-2 wages.
(g)
Wage expense safe harbor
—(1)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative using either the section 861 method of cost allocation under § 1.199A-10(d) or the simplified deduction method under § 1.199A-10(e) may determine the amount of W-2 wages that are properly allocable to DPGR for a taxable year by multiplying the amount of W-2 wages determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the taxable year by the ratio of the Specified Cooperative's wage expense included in calculating QPAI for the taxable year to the Specified Cooperative's total wage expense used in calculating the Specified Cooperative's taxable income for the taxable year, without regard to any wage expense disallowed by section 465, 469, 704(d), or 1366(d). A Specified Cooperative that uses either the section 861 method of cost allocation or the simplified deduction method to determine QPAI must use the same expense allocation and apportionment methods that it uses to determine QPAI to allocate and apportion wage expense for purposes of this safe harbor. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1), the term wage expense means wages (that is, compensation paid by the employer in the active conduct of a trade or business to its employees) that are properly taken into account under the Specified Cooperative's method of accounting.
(2)
Wage expense included in cost of goods sold.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a Specified Cooperative may determine its wage expense included in cost of goods sold (COGS) using a reasonable method based on all the facts and circumstances, such as using the amount of direct labor included in COGS or using section 263A labor costs (as defined in § 1.263A-1(h)(4)(ii)) included in COGS. The chosen reasonable method must be consistently applied from one taxable year to another and must clearly reflect the portion of wage expense included in COGS. The method must also be reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. The books and records maintained for wage expense included in COGS must be consistent with any allocations under this paragraph (g)(2).
(3)
Small business simplified overall method safe harbor.
The Specified Cooperative that uses the small business simplified overall method under § 1.199A-10(f) may use the small business simplified overall method safe harbor for determining the amount of W-2 wages determined under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section that is properly allocable to DPGR. Under this safe harbor, the amount of W-2 wages determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is properly allocable to DPGR is equal to the same proportion of W-2 wages determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that the amount of DPGR bears to the Specified Cooperative's total gross receipts.
(h)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.199A-7 through 1.199A-12 for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.
[T.D. 9947, 86 FR 5569, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.199A-12
Expanded affiliated groups.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of section 199A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Except as otherwise provided in the Code or regulations issued under the relevant section of the Code (for example, sections 199A(g)(3)(D)(ii) and 267, § 1.199A-8(c), paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the consolidated return regulations under section 1502), each nonexempt Specified Cooperative (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(2)(ii)) that is a member of an expanded affiliated group (EAG) (defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) computes its own taxable income or loss, qualified production activities income (QPAI) (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(4)(ii)), and W-2 wages (defined in § 1.199A-11(b)). For purposes of this section unless otherwise specified, the term
Specified Cooperative
means a nonexempt Specified Cooperative. If a Specified Cooperative is also a member of a consolidated group, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(1)
Definition of an expanded affiliated group.
An EAG is an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a), determined by substituting “more than 50 percent” for “at least 80 percent” in each place it appears and without regard to section 1504(b)(2) and (4).
(2)
Identification of members of an expanded affiliated group
—(i)
In general.
Each Specified Cooperative must determine if it is a member of an EAG on a daily basis.
(ii)
Becoming or ceasing to be a member of an expanded affiliated group.
If a Specified Cooperative becomes or ceases to be a member of an EAG, the Specified Cooperative is treated as becoming or ceasing to be a member of the EAG at the end of the day on which its status as a member changes.
(3)
Attribution of activities
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, if a Specified Cooperative that is a member of an EAG (disposing member) derives gross receipts (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(2)(iii)) from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition (defined in § 1.199A-9(j)) of agricultural or horticultural products (defined in § 1.199A-8(a)(4)) that were manufactured, produced, grown or extracted (MPGE) (defined in § 1.199A-9(f)), in whole or significant part (defined in § 1.199A-9(h)), in the United States (defined in § 1.199A-9(i)) by another Specified Cooperative, then the disposing member is treated as conducting the previous activities conducted by such other Specified Cooperative with respect to the agricultural or horticultural products in determining whether its gross receipts are domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) (defined in § 1.199A-8(b)(3)(ii)) if—
(A) Such property was MPGE by such other Specified Cooperative, and
(B) The disposing member is a member of the same EAG as such other Specified Cooperative at the time that the disposing member disposes of the agricultural or horticultural products.
(ii)
Date of disposition for leases, rentals, or licenses.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, with respect to a lease, rental, or license, the disposing member described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is treated as having disposed of the agricultural or horticultural products on the date or dates on which it takes into account the gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, or license under its methods of accounting.
(iii)
Date of disposition for sales, exchanges, or other dispositions.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this
section, with respect to a sale, exchange, or other disposition, the disposing member is treated as having disposed of the agricultural or horticultural products on the date on which it ceases to own the agricultural or horticultural products for Federal income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account.
(iv)
Exception.
A Specified Cooperative is not attributed nonpatronage activities conducted by another Specified Cooperative.
See
§ 1.199A-8(b)(2)(ii).
(4)
Marketing Specified Cooperatives.
A Specified Cooperative is treated as having MPGE in whole or significant part any agricultural or horticultural product within the United States marketed by the Specified Cooperative which its patrons have so MPGE. Patrons are defined in § 1.1388-1(e).
(5)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If a transaction between members of an EAG is engaged in or structured with a principal purpose of qualifying for, or increasing the amount of, the section 199A(g) deduction of the EAG or the portion of the section 199A(g) deduction allocated to one or more members of the EAG, the Secretary may make adjustments to eliminate the effect of the transaction on the computation of the section 199A(g) deduction.
(b)
Computation of EAG's section 199A(g) deduction.
—(1)
In general.
The section 199A(g) deduction for an EAG is determined by separately computing the section 199A(g) deduction from the patronage sources of Specified Cooperatives that are members of the EAG. The section 199A(g) deduction from patronage sources of Specified Cooperatives is determined by aggregating the income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages, if any, of each patronage source of a Specified Cooperative that is a member of the EAG. For purposes of this determination, a member's QPAI may be positive or negative. A Specified Cooperative's taxable income or loss and QPAI is determined by reference to the Specified Cooperative's method of accounting. For purposes of determining the section 199A(g) deduction for an EAG, taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages of a Specified Cooperative from nonpatronage sources are considered to be zero, other than as allowed under § 1.199A-8(b)(2)(ii).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
Nonexempt Specified Cooperatives X, Y, and Z, calendar year taxpayers, are the only members of an EAG and are not members of a consolidated group. X has patronage source taxable income of $50,000, QPAI of $15,000, and W-2 wages of $0. Y has patronage source taxable income of ($20,000), QPAI of ($1,000), and W-2 wages of $750. Z has patronage source taxable income of $0, QPAI of $0, and W-2 wages of $3,000.
(ii)
Analysis.
In determining the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction, the EAG aggregates each member's patronage source taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages. Thus, the EAG has patronage source taxable income of $30,000, the sum of X's patronage source taxable income of $50,000, Y's patronage source taxable income of ($20,000), and Z's patronage source taxable income of $0. The EAG has QPAI of $14,000, the sum of X's QPAI of $15,000, Y's QPAI of ($1,000), and Z's QPAI of $0. The EAG has W-2 wages of $3,750, the sum of X's W-2 wages of $0, Y's W-2 wages of $750, and Z's W-2 wages of $3,000. Accordingly, the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction equals $1,260, 9% of $14,000, the lesser of the QPAI and patronage source taxable income, but not greater than $1,875, 50% of its W-2 wages of $3,750. This result would be the same if X had a nonpatronage source income or loss, because nonpatronage source income of a nonexempt Specified Cooperative is not taken into account in determining the section 199A(g) deduction.
(3)
Net operating loss carryovers/carrybacks.
In determining the taxable income of an EAG, if a Specified Cooperative has a net operating loss (NOL) from its patronage sources that may be carried over or carried back (in accordance with section 172) to the taxable year, then for purposes of determining the taxable income of the Specified Cooperative, the amount of the NOL used to offset taxable income cannot exceed the taxable income of the patronage source of that Specified Cooperative.
(4)
Losses used to reduce taxable income of an expanded affiliated group.
The amount of an NOL sustained by a Specified Cooperative member of an EAG that is used in the year sustained in determining an EAG's taxable income limitation under § 1.199A-8(b)(5)(ii)(C) is not treated as an NOL carryover to any taxable year in determining the taxable income limitation under § 1.199A-8(b)(5)(ii)(C). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), an NOL is considered to be used if it reduces an EAG's aggregate taxable income from patronage sources or nonpatronage sources, as the case may be, regardless of whether the use of the NOL actually reduces the amount of the section 199A(g) deduction that the EAG would otherwise derive. An NOL is not considered to be used to the extent that it reduces an EAG's aggregate taxable income from patronage sources to an amount less than zero. If more than one Specified Cooperative has an NOL used in the same taxable year to reduce the EAG's taxable income from patronage sources, the respective NOLs are deemed used in proportion to the amount of each Specified Cooperative's NOL.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
Nonexempt Specified Cooperatives A and B are the only two members of an EAG. A and B are both calendar year taxpayers and they do not join in the filing of a consolidated Federal income tax return. Neither A nor B had taxable income or loss prior to 2020. In 2020, A has patronage QPAI and patronage taxable income of $1,000 and B has patronage QPAI of $1,000 and a patronage NOL of $1,500. A also has nonpatronage income of $3,000. B has no activities other than from its patronage activities. In 2021, A has patronage QPAI of $2,000 and patronage taxable income of $1,000 and B has patronage QPAI of $2,000 and patronage taxable income prior to the NOL deduction allowed under section 172 of $2,000. Neither A nor B has nonpatronage activities in 2021. A's and B's patronage activities have aggregate W-2 wages in excess of the section 199A(g)(1)(B) wage limitation in both 2020 and 2021.
(ii)
Section 199A(g) deduction for 2020.
In determining the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction for 2020, A's $1,000 of QPAI and B's $1,000 of QPAI are aggregated, as are A's $1,000 of taxable income from its patronage activities and B's $1,500 NOL from its patronage activities. A's nonpatronage income is not included. Thus, for 2020, the EAG has patronage QPAI of $2,000 and patronage taxable income of ($500). The EAG's section 199A(g) deduction for 2020 is 9% of the lesser of its patronage QPAI or its patronage taxable income. Because the EAG has a taxable loss from patronage sources in 2020, the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction is $0.
(iii)
Section 199A(a) deduction for 2021.
In determining the EAG's section 199A deduction for 2021, A's patronage QPAI of $2,000 and B's patronage QPAI of $2,000 are aggregated, resulting in the EAG having patronage QPAI of $4,000. Also, $1,000 of B's patronage NOL from 2020 was used in 2020 to reduce the EAG's taxable income from patronage sources to $0. The remaining $500 of B's patronage NOL from 2020 is not considered to have been used in 2020 because it reduced the EAG's patronage taxable income to less than $0. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the EAG's taxable income limitation under § 1.199A-8(b)(5) in 2021, B is deemed to have only a $500 NOL carryover from its patronage sources from 2020 to offset a portion of its 2021 taxable income from its patronage sources. Thus, B's taxable income from its patronage sources in 2021 is $1,500, which is aggregated with A's $1,000 of taxable income from its patronage sources. The EAG's taxable income limitation in 2021 is $2,500. The EAG's section 199A(g) deduction is 9% of the lesser of its patronage sourced QPAI of $4,000 and its taxable income from patronage sources of $2,500. Thus, the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction in 2021 is 9% of $2,500, or $225. The results for 2021 would be the same if neither A nor B had patronage sourced QPAI in 2020.
(c)
Allocation of an expanded affiliated group's section 199A(g) deduction among members of the expanded affiliated group
—(1)
In general.
An EAG's section 199A(g) deduction from its patronage sources, as determined in paragraph (b) of this section, is allocated among the
Specified Cooperatives that are members of the EAG in proportion to each Specified Cooperative's patronage QPAI, regardless of whether the Specified Cooperative has patronage taxable income or W-2 wages for the taxable year. For these purposes, if a Specified Cooperative has negative patronage QPAI, such QPAI is treated as zero. Pursuant to § 1.199A-8(b)(6), a patronage section 199A(g) deduction can be applied only against patronage income and deductions.
(2)
Use of section 199A(g) deduction to create or increase a net operating loss.
If a Specified Cooperative that is a member of an EAG has some or all of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction allocated to it under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the amount allocated exceeds patronage taxable income, determined as described in this section and prior to allocation of the section 199A(g) deduction, the section 199A(g) deduction will create an NOL for the patronage source. Similarly, if a Specified Cooperative that is a member of an EAG, prior to the allocation of some or all of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction to the member, has a patronage NOL for the taxable year, the portion of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction allocated to the member will increase such NOL.
(d)
Special rules for members of the same consolidated group
—(1)
Intercompany transactions.
In the case of an intercompany transaction between consolidated group members S and B (as the terms intercompany transaction, S, and B are defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)), S takes the intercompany transaction into account in computing the section 199A(g) deduction at the same time and in the same proportion as S takes into account the income, gain, deduction, or loss from the intercompany transaction under § 1.1502-13.
(2)
Application of the simplified deduction method and the small business simplified overall method.
For purposes of applying the simplified deduction method under § 1.199A-10(e) and the small business simplified overall method under § 1.199A-10(f), a Specified Cooperative that is part of a consolidated group determines its QPAI using its members' DPGR, non-DPGR, cost of goods sold (COGS), and all other deductions, expenses, or losses (hereinafter deductions), determined after the application of § 1.1502-13.
(3)
Determining the section 199A(g) deduction
—(i)
Expanded affiliated group consists of consolidated group and non-consolidated group members.
In determining the section 199A(g) deduction, if an EAG includes Specified Cooperatives that are members of the same consolidated group and Specified Cooperatives that are not members of the same consolidated group, the consolidated taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages, from patronage sources, if any, of the consolidated group (and not the separate taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages from patronage sources of the members of the consolidated group), are aggregated with the taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages, from patronage sources, if any, of the non-consolidated group members. For example, if A, B, C, S1, and S2 are Specified Cooperatives that are members of the same EAG, and A, S1, and S2 are members of the same consolidated group (the A consolidated group), then the A consolidated group is treated as one member of the EAG. Accordingly, the EAG is considered to have three members—the A consolidated group, B, and C. The consolidated taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages from patronage sources, if any, of the A consolidated group are aggregated with the taxable income or loss from patronage sources, QPAI, and W-2 wages, if any, of B and C in determining the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction from patronage sources. Pursuant to § 1.199A-8(b)(6), a patronage section 199A(g) deduction can be applied only against patronage income and deductions.
(ii)
Expanded affiliated group consists only of members of a single consolidated group.
If all of the Specified Cooperatives that are members of an EAG are also members of the same consolidated group, the consolidated group's section 199A(g) deduction is determined using the consolidated group's consolidated taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages, from patronage sources rather than the separate taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages from patronage sources of its members.
(4)
Allocation of the section 199A(g) deduction of a consolidated group among its members.
The section 199A(g) deduction from patronage sources of a consolidated group (or the section 199A(g) deduction allocated to a consolidated group that is a member of an EAG) is allocated among the patronage sources of Specified Cooperatives in proportion to each Specified Cooperative's patronage QPAI, regardless of whether the Specified Cooperative has patronage separate taxable income or W-2 wages for the taxable year. In allocating the section 199A(g) deduction of a patronage source of a Specified Cooperative that is part of a consolidated group among patronage sources of other members of the same group, any redetermination of a member's patronage receipts, COGS, or other deductions from an intercompany transaction under § 1.1502-13(c)(1)(i) or (c)(4) is not taken into account for purposes of section 199A(g). Also, for purposes of this allocation, if a patronage source of a Specified Cooperative that is a member of a consolidated group has negative QPAI, the QPAI of the patronage source is treated as zero.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(1)
Example 1.
Specified Cooperatives X, Y, and Z are members of the same EAG but are not members of a consolidated group. X, Y, and Z each files Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis. None of X, Y, or Z have activities other than from its patronage sources. Prior to 2020, X had no taxable income or loss. In 2020, X has taxable income of $0, QPAI of $2,000, and W-2 wages of $0, Y has taxable income of $4,000, QPAI of $3,000, and W-2 wages of $500, and Z has taxable income of $4,000, QPAI of $5,000, and W-2 wages of $2,500. Accordingly, the EAG's patronage source taxable income is $8,000, the sum of X's taxable income of $0, Y's taxable income of $4,000, and Z's taxable income of $4,000. The EAG has QPAI of $10,000, the sum of X's QPAI of $2,000, Y's QPAI of $3,000, and Z's QPAI of $5,000. The EAG's W-2 wages are $3,000, the sum of X's W-2 wages of $0, Y's W-2 wages of $500, and Z's W-2 wages of $2,500. Thus, the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction for 2020 is $720 (9% of the lesser of the EAG's patronage source taxable income of $8,000 and the EAG's QPAI of $10,000, but no greater than 50% of its W-2 wages of $3,000, that is $1,500). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the $720 section 199A(g) deduction is allocated to X, Y, and Z in proportion to their respective amounts of QPAI, that is $144 to X ($720 × $2,000/$10,000), $216 to Y ($720 × $3,000/$10,000), and $360 to Z ($720 × $5,000/$10,000). Although X's patronage source taxable income for 2020 determined prior to allocation of a portion of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction to it was $0, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, X will have an NOL from its patronage source for 2020 equal to $144, which will be a carryover to 2021.
(2)
Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
Corporation X is the common parent of a consolidated group, consisting of X and Y, which has filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for many years. Corporation P is the common parent of a consolidated group, consisting of P and S, which has filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for many years. The X and P consolidated groups each file their consolidated Federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis. X, Y, P, and S are each Specified Cooperatives, and none of X, Y, P, or S has ever had activities other than from its patronage sources. The X consolidated group and the P consolidated group are members of the same EAG in 2021. In 2020, the X consolidated group incurred a consolidated net operating loss (CNOL) of $25,000. Neither P nor S (nor the P consolidated group) has ever incurred an NOL. In 2021, the X consolidated group has (prior to the deduction under section 172) taxable income of $8,000 and the P consolidated group has taxable income of $20,000. X's QPAI is $8,000, Y's QPAI is ($13,000), P's QPAI is $16,000 and S's QPAI is $4,000. There are sufficient W-2 wages to exceed the section 199A(g)(1)(B) limitation.
(ii)
Analysis.
The X consolidated group uses $8,000 of its CNOL from 2020 to offset the X consolidated group's taxable income in 2021. None of the X consolidated group's remaining CNOL may be used to offset taxable income of
the P consolidated group under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction for 2021, the EAG has taxable income of $20,000 (the X consolidated group's taxable income, after the deduction under section 172, of $0 plus the P consolidated group's taxable income of $20,000). The EAG has QPAI of $15,000 (the X consolidated group's QPAI of ($5,000) (X's $8,000 + Y's ($13,000)), and the P consolidated group's QPAI of $20,000 (P's $16,000 + S's $4,000)). The EAG's section 199A(g) deduction equals $1,350, 9% of the lesser of its taxable income of $20,000 and its QPAI of $15,000. The section 199A(g) deduction is allocated between the X and P consolidated groups in proportion to their respective QPAI. Because the X consolidated group has negative QPAI, all of the section 199A(g) deduction of $1,350 is allocated to the P consolidated group. This $1,350 is allocated between P and S, the members of the P consolidated group, in proportion to their QPAI. Accordingly, P is allocated $1,080 ($1,350 × $16,000/$20,000) and S is allocated $270 ($1,350 × $4,000/$20,000).
(f)
Allocation of patronage income and loss by a Specified Cooperative that is a member of the expanded affiliated group for only a portion of the year
—(1)
In general.
A Specified Cooperative that becomes or ceases to be a member of an EAG during its taxable year must allocate its taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages between the portion of the taxable year that the Specified Cooperative is a member of the EAG and the portion of the taxable year that the Specified Cooperative is not a member of the EAG. This allocation of items is made by using the pro rata allocation method described in this paragraph (f)(1). Under the pro rata allocation method, an equal portion of patronage taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages is assigned to each day of the Specified Cooperative's taxable year. Those items assigned to those days that the Specified Cooperative was a member of the EAG are then aggregated.
(2)
Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under § 1.1502-76(b).
If § 1.1502-76(b) (relating to items included in a consolidated return) applies to a Specified Cooperative that is a member of an EAG, then any allocation of items required under this paragraph (f) is made only after the allocation of the items pursuant to § 1.1502-76(b).
(g)
Total section 199A(g) deduction for a Specified Cooperative that is a member of an expanded affiliated group for some or all of its taxable year
—(1)
Member of the same EAG for the entire taxable year.
If a Specified Cooperative is a member of the same EAG for its entire taxable year, the Specified Cooperative's section 199A(g) deduction for the taxable year is the amount of the section 199A(g) deduction allocated to it by the EAG under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(2)
Member of the expanded affiliated group for a portion of the taxable year.
If a Specified Cooperative is a member of an EAG for only a portion of its taxable year and is either not a member of any EAG or is a member of another EAG, or both, for another portion of the taxable year, the Specified Cooperative's section 199A(g) deduction for the taxable year is the sum of its section 199A(g) deductions for each portion of the taxable year.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
Specified Cooperatives X and Y, calendar year taxpayers, are members of the same EAG for the entire 2020 taxable year. Specified Cooperative Z, also a calendar year taxpayer, is a member of the EAG of which X and Y are members for the first half of 2020 and not a member of any EAG for the second half of 2020. None of X, Y, or Z have activities other than from its patronage sources. Assume that X, Y, and Z each has W-2 wages in excess of the section 199A(g)(1)(B) wage limitation for all relevant periods. In 2020, X has taxable income of $2,000 and QPAI of $600, Y has taxable loss of $400 and QPAI of ($200), and Z has taxable income of $1,400 and QPAI of $2,400.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to the pro rata allocation method, $700 of Z's 2020 taxable income and $1,200 of its QPAI are allocated to the first half of the 2020 taxable year (the period in which Z is a member of the EAG) and $700 of Z's 2020
taxable income and $1,200 of its QPAI are allocated to the second half of the 2020 taxable year (the period in which Z is not a member of any EAG). Accordingly, in 2020, the EAG has taxable income from patronage sources of $2,300 ($2,000 + ($400) + $700) and QPAI of $1,600 ($600 + ($200) + $1,200). The EAG's section 199A(g) deduction for 2020 is $144 (9% of the lesser of the EAG's taxable income of $2,300 or QPAI of $1,600). Pursuant to § 1.199A-12(c)(1), this $144 deduction is allocated to X, Y, and Z in proportion to their respective QPAI. Accordingly, X is allocated $48 of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction ($144 × ($600/($600 + $0 + $1,200))), Y is allocated $0 of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction ($144 × ($0/($600 + $0 + $1,200))), and Z is allocated $96 of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction ($144 × ($1,200/($600 + $0 + $1,200))). For the second half of 2020, Z has taxable income of $700 and QPAI of $1,200. Therefore, for the second half of 2020, Z has a section 199A(g) deduction of $63 (9% of the lesser of its taxable income of $700 or its QPAI of $1,200). Accordingly, X's 2020 section 199A(g) deduction is $48 and Y's 2020 section 199A(g) deduction is $0. Z's 2020 section 199A(g) deduction is $159, the sum of $96, the portion of the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction allocated to Z for the first half of 2020 and Z's $63 section 199A(g) deduction for the second half of 2020.
(h)
Computation of section 199A(g) deduction for members of an expanded affiliated group with different taxable years
—(1)
In general.
If Specified Cooperatives that are members of an EAG have different taxable years, in determining the section 199A(g) deduction of a member (the computing member), the computing member is required to take into account the taxable income or loss, determined without regard to the section 199A(g) deduction, QPAI, and W-2 wages of each other group member that are both—
(i) Attributable to the period that each other member of the EAG and the computing member are members of the EAG; and
(ii) Taken into account in a taxable year that begins after the effective date of section 199A(g) and ends with or within the taxable year of the computing member with respect to which the section 199A(g) deduction is computed.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (h).
(i)
Facts.
Specified Cooperatives X, Y, and Z are members of the same EAG. Neither X, Y, nor Z is a member of a consolidated group. X and Y are calendar year taxpayers and Z is a June 30 fiscal year taxpayer. Z came into existence on July 1, 2020. None of X, Y, or Z have activities other than from its patronage sources. Each Specified Cooperative has taxable income that exceeds its QPAI and W-2 wages in excess of the section 199A(g)(1)(B) wage limitation. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2020, X's QPAI is $8,000 and Y's QPAI is ($6,000). For its taxable year ending June 30, 2021, Z's QPAI is $2,000.
(ii)
2020 Computation.
In computing X's and Y's respective section 199A(g) deductions for their taxable years ending December 31, 2020, X's taxable income or loss, QPAI and W-2 wages and Y's taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages from their respective taxable years ending December 31, 2020, are aggregated. The EAG's QPAI for this purpose is $2,000 (X's QPAI of $8,000 + Y's QPAI of ($6,000)). Accordingly, the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction is $180 (9% × $2,000). The $180 deduction is allocated to each of X and Y in proportion to their respective QPAI as a percentage of the QPAI of each member of the EAG that was taken into account in computing the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in allocating the section 199A(g) deduction between X and Y, because Y's QPAI is negative, Y's QPAI is treated as being $0. Accordingly, X's section 199A(g) deduction for its taxable year ending December 31, 2020, is $180 ($180 × $8,000/($8,000 + $0)). Y's section 199A(g) deduction for its taxable year ending December 31, 2020, is $0 ($180 × $0/($8,000 + $0)).
(iii)
2021 Computation.
In computing Z's section 199A(g) deduction for its taxable year ending June 30, 2021, X's and Y's items from their respective taxable years ending December 31, 2020, are taken into account. Therefore, X's taxable income or loss and Y's taxable
income or loss, determined without regard to the section 199A(g) deduction, QPAI, and W-2 wages from their taxable years ending December 31, 2020, are aggregated with Z's taxable income or loss, QPAI, and W-2 wages from its taxable year ending June 30, 2021. The EAG's QPAI is $4,000 (X's QPAI of $8,000 + Y's QPAI of ($6,000) + Z's QPAI of $2,000). The EAG's section 199A(g) deduction is $360 (9% × $4,000). A portion of the $360 deduction is allocated to Z in proportion to its QPAI as a percentage of the QPAI of each member of the EAG that was taken into account in computing the EAG's section 199A(g) deduction. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in allocating a portion of the $360 deduction to Z, Y's QPAI is treated as being $0 because Y's QPAI is negative. Z's section 199A(g) deduction for its taxable year ending June 30, 2021, is $72 ($360 × ($2,000/($8,000 + $0 + $2,000))).
(i)
Partnership owned by expanded affiliated group
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 199A(g)(3)(D) relating to DPGR, if all of the interests in the capital and profits of a partnership are owned by members of a single EAG at all times during the taxable year of such partnership (EAG partnership), then the EAG partnership and all members of that EAG are treated as a single taxpayer during such period.
(2)
Attribution of activities
—(
i
)
In general.
If a Specified Cooperative which is a member of an EAG (disposing member) derives gross receipts from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of property that was MPGE by an EAG partnership, all the partners of which are members of the same EAG to which the disposing member belongs at the time that the disposing member disposes of such property, then the disposing member is treated as conducting the MPGE activities previously conducted by the EAG partnership with respect to that property. The previous sentence applies only for those taxable years in which the disposing member is a member of the EAG of which all the partners of the EAG partnership are members for the entire taxable year of the EAG partnership. With respect to a lease, rental, or license, the disposing member is treated as having disposed of the property on the date or dates on which it takes into account its gross receipts from the lease, rental, or license under its method of accounting. With respect to a sale, exchange, or other disposition, the disposing member is treated as having disposed of the property on the date it ceases to own the property for Federal income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account. Likewise, if an EAG partnership derives gross receipts from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of property that was MPGE by a member (or members) of the same EAG (the producing member) to which all the partners of the EAG partnership belong at the time that the EAG partnership disposes of such property, then the EAG partnership is treated as conducting the MPGE activities previously conducted by the producing member with respect to that property. The previous sentence applies only for those taxable years in which the producing member is a member of the EAG of which all the partners of the EAG partnership are members for the entire taxable year of the EAG partnership. With respect to a lease, rental, or license, the EAG partnership is treated as having disposed of the property on the date or dates on which it takes into account its gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, or license under its method of accounting. With respect to a sale, exchange, or other disposition, the EAG partnership is treated as having disposed of the property on the date it ceases to own the property for Federal income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account.
(
ii
)
Attribution between expanded affiliated group partnerships.
If an EAG partnership (disposing partnership) derives gross receipts from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of property that was MPGE by another EAG partnership (producing partnership), then the disposing partnership is treated as conducting the MPGE activities previously conducted by the producing partnership with respect to that property, provided that each of these partnerships (the producing partnership and the disposing partnership) is owned for its entire taxable year in which the disposing partnership disposes of such property by
members of the same EAG. With respect to a lease, rental, or license, the disposing partnership is treated as having disposed of the property on the date or dates on which it takes into account its gross receipts from the lease, rental, or license under its method of accounting. With respect to a sale, exchange, or other disposition, the disposing partnership is treated as having disposed of the property on the date it ceases to own the property for Federal income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account.
(j)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2021. Taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.199A-7 through 1.199A-12 for taxable years beginning on or before that date, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

# Additional Itemized Deductions for Individuals
§ 1.211-1
Allowance of deductions.
In computing taxable income under section 63(a), the deductions provided by sections 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217 shall be allowed subject to the exceptions provided in Part IX, Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code (section 261 and following, relating to items not deductible).
[T.D. 6796, 30 FR 1037, Feb. 2, 1965]
§ 1.212-1
Nontrade or nonbusiness expenses.
(a) An expense may be deducted under section 212 only if:
(1) It has been paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year (i) for the production or collection of income which, if and when realized, will be required to be included in income for Federal income tax purposes, or (ii) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of such income, or (iii) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax; and
(2) It is an ordinary and necessary expense for any of the purposes stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(b) The term
income
for the purpose of section 212 includes not merely income of the taxable year but also income which the taxpayer has realized in a prior taxable year or may realize in subsequent taxable years; and is not confined to recurring income but applies as well to gains from the disposition of property. For example, if defaulted bonds, the interest from which if received would be includible in income, are purchased with the expectation of realizing capital gain on their resale, even though no current yield thereon is anticipated, ordinary and necessary expenses thereafter paid or incurred in connection with such bonds are deductible. Similarly, ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in the management, conservation, or maintenance of a building devoted to rental purposes are deductible notwithstanding that there is actually no income therefrom in the taxable year, and regardless of the manner in which or the purpose for which the property in question was acquired. Expenses paid or incurred in managing, conserving, or maintaining property held for investment may be deductible under section 212 even though the property is not currently productive and there is no likelihood that the property will be sold at a profit or will otherwise be productive of income and even though the property is held merely to minimize a loss with respect thereto.
(c) In the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, expenses of carrying on transactions which do not constitute a trade or business of the taxpayer and are not carried on for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, but which are carried on primarily as a sport, hobby, or recreation are not allowable as nontrade or nonbusiness expenses. The question whether or not a transaction is carried on primarily for the production of income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production or collection of income, rather than primarily as a sport, hobby, or recreation, is not to be determined solely from the intention of the taxpayer but rather from all
the circumstances of the case. For example, consideration will be given to the record of prior gain or loss of the taxpayer in the activity, the relation between the type of activity and the principal occupation of the taxpayer, and the uses to which the property or what it produces is put by the taxpayer. For provisions relating to activities not engaged in for profit applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, see section 183 and the regulations thereunder.
(d) Expenses, to be deductible under section 212, must be “ordinary and necessary”. Thus, such expenses must be reasonable in amount and must bear a reasonable and proximate relation to the production or collection of taxable income or to the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income.
(e) A deduction under section 212 is subject to the restrictions and limitations in part IX (section 261 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to items not deductible. Thus, no deduction is allowable under section 212 for any amount allocable to the production or collection of one or more classes of income which are not includible in gross income, or for any amount allocable to the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income which is not included in gross income. See section 265. Nor does section 212 allow the deduction of any expenses which are disallowed by any of the provisions of subtitle A of the Code, even though such expenses may be paid or incurred for one of the purposes specified in section 212.
(f) Among expenditures not allowable as deductions under section 212 are the following: Commuter's expenses; expenses of taking special courses or training; expenses for improving personal appearance; the cost of rental of a safe-deposit box for storing jewelry and other personal effects; expenses such as those paid or incurred in seeking employment or in placing oneself in a position to begin rendering personal services for compensation, campaign expenses of a candidate for public office, bar examination fees and other expenses paid or incurred in securing admission to the bar, and corresponding fees and expenses paid or incurred by physicians, dentists, accountants, and other taxpayers for securing the right to practice their respective professions. See, however, section 162 and the regulations thereunder.
(g) Fees for services of investment counsel, custodial fees, clerical help, office rent, and similar expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with investments held by him are deductible under section 212 only if (1) they are paid or incurred by the taxpayer for the production or collection of income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of investments held by him for the production of income; and (2) they are ordinary and necessary under all the circumstances, having regard to the type of investment and to the relation of the taxpayer to such investment.
(h) Ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in connection with the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for use as a residence by the taxpayer are not deductible. However, ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in connection with the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held by the taxpayer as rental property are deductible even though such property was formerly held by the taxpayer for use as a home.
(i) Reasonable amounts paid or incurred by the fiduciary of an estate or trust on account of administration expenses, including fiduciaries' fees and expenses of litigation, which are ordinary and necessary in connection with the performance of the duties of administration are deductible under section 212, notwithstanding that the estate or trust is not engaged in a trade or business, except to the extent that such expenses are allocable to the production or collection of tax-exempt income. But see section 642 (g) and the regulations thereunder for disallowance of such deductions to an estate where such items are allowed as a deduction under section 2053 or 2054 in computing the net estate subject to the estate tax.
(j) Reasonable amounts paid or incurred for the services of a guardian or committee for a ward or minor, and
other expenses of guardians and committees which are ordinary and necessary, in connection with the production or collection of income inuring to the ward or minor, or in connection with the management, conservation, or maintenance of property, held for the production of income, belonging to the ward or minor, are deductible.
(k) Expenses paid or incurred in defending or perfecting title to property, in recovering property (other than investment property and amounts of income which, if and when recovered, must be included in gross income), or in developing or improving property, constitute a part of the cost of the property and are not deductible expenses. Attorneys' fees paid in a suit to quiet title to lands are not deductible; but if the suit is also to collect accrued rents thereon, that portion of such fees is deductible which is properly allocable to the services rendered in collecting such rents. Expenses paid or incurred in protecting or asserting one's right to property of a decedent as heir or legatee, or as beneficiary under a testamentary trust, are not deductible.
(l) Expenses paid or incurred by an individual in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, whether the taxing authority be Federal, State, or municipal, and whether the tax be income, estate, gift, property, or any other tax, are deductible. Thus, expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer for tax counsel or expenses paid or incurred in connection with the preparation of his tax returns or in connection with any proceedings involved in determining the extent of his tax liability or in contesting his tax liability are deductible.
(m) An expense (not otherwise deductible) paid or incurred by an individual in determining or contesting a liability asserted against him does not become deductible by reason of the fact that property held by him for the production of income may be required to be used or sold for the purpose of satisfying such liability.
(n) Capital expenditures are not allowable as nontrade or nonbusiness expenses. The deduction of an item otherwise allowable under section 212 will not be disallowed simply because the taxpayer was entitled under Subtitle A of the Code to treat such item as a capital expenditure, rather than to deduct it as an expense. For example, see section 266. Where, however, the item may properly be treated only as a capital expenditure or where it was properly so treated under an option granted in Subtitle A of the Code, no deduction is allowable under section 212; and this is true regardless of whether any basis adjustment is allowed under any other provision of the Code.
(o) The provisions of section 212 are not intended in any way to disallow expenses which would otherwise be allowable under section 162 and the regulations thereunder. Double deductions are not permitted. Amounts deducted under one provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 cannot again be deducted under any other provision thereof.
(p)
Frustration of public policy.
The deduction of a payment will be disallowed under section 212 if the payment is of a type for which a deduction would be disallowed under section 162(c), (f), or (g) and the regulations thereunder in the case of a business expense.

§ 1.213-1
Medical, dental, etc., expenses.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
(1) Section 213 permits a deduction of payments for certain medical expenses (including expenses for medicine and drugs). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section (relating to special rule for decedents) a deduction is allowable only to individuals and only with respect to medical expenses actually paid during the taxable year, regardless of when the incident or event which occasioned the expenses occurred and regardless of the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer in making his income tax return. Thus, if the medical expenses are incurred but not paid during the taxable year, no deduction for such expenses shall be allowed for such year.
(2) Except as provided in subparagraphs (4)(i) and (5)(i) of this paragraph, only such medical expenses (including the allowable expenses for medicine and drugs) are deductible as exceed 3 percent of the adjusted gross income for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the amounts paid during the taxable year for insurance that constitute expenses paid for medical care shall, for purposes of computing total medical expenses, be reduced by the amount determined under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph. For the amounts paid during the taxable year for medicine and drugs which may be taken into account in computing total medical expenses, see paragraph (b) of this section. For the maximum deduction allowable under section 213 in the case of certain taxable years, see paragraph (c) of this section. As to what constitutes “adjusted gross income”, see section 62 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)(i) For medical expenses paid (including expenses paid for medicine and drugs) to be deductible, they must be for medical care of the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer and not be compensated for by insurance or otherwise. Expenses paid for the medical care of a dependent, as defined in section 152 and the regulations thereunder, are deductible under this section even though the dependent has gross income equal to or in excess of the amount determined pursuant to § 1.151-2 applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins. Where such expenses are paid by two or more persons and the conditions of section 152(c) and the regulations thereunder are met, the medical expenses are deductible only by the person designated in the multiple support agreement filed by such persons and such deduction is limited to the amount of medical expenses paid by such person.
(ii) An amount excluded from gross income under section 105 (c) or (d) (relating to amounts received under accident and health plans) and the regulations thereunder shall not constitute compensation for expenses paid for medical care. Exclusion of such amounts from gross income will not affect the treatment of expenses paid for medical care.
(iii) The application of the rule allowing a deduction for medical expenses to the extent not compensated for by insurance or otherwise may be illustrated by the following example in which it is assumed that neither the taxpayer nor his wife has attained the age of 65:

# Example.
Taxpayer H, married to W and having one dependent child, had adjusted gross income for 1956 of $3,000. During 1956 he paid $300 for medical care, of which $100 was for treatment of his dependent child and $200 for an operation on W which was performed in September 1955. In 1956 he received a payment of $50 for health insurance to cover a portion of the cost of W's operation performed during 1955. The deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956, provided the taxpayer itemizes his deductions and does not compute his tax under section 3 by use of the tax table, is $160, computed as follows:
Payments in 1956 for medical care
$300
Less: Amount of insurance received in 1956
50
Payments in 1956 for medical care not compensated for during 1956
250
Less: 3 percent of $3,000 (adjusted gross income)
90
Excess, allowable as a deduction for 1956
160
(4)(i) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, where either the taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year, the 3-percent limitation on the deduction for medical expenses does not apply with respect to expenses for medical care of the taxpayer or his spouse. Moreover, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1959, and before January 1, 1967, the 3-percent limitation on the deduction for medical expenses does not apply to amounts paid for the medical care of a dependent (as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or his spouse and who has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxpayer's taxable year. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, all amounts paid by the taxpayer for medicine and drugs are subject to the 1-percent limitation provided by section 213(b). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before
January 1, 1967, the 1-percent limitation provided by section 213(b) does not apply, under certain circumstances, to amounts paid by the taxpayer for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer and his spouse or for a dependent (as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse. (For additional provisions relating to the 1-percent limitation with respect to medicine and drugs, see paragraph (b) of this section.) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, whether or not the 3-percent or 1-percent limitation applies, the total medical expenses deductible under section 213 are subject to the limitations described in section 213(c) and paragraph (c) of this section and, where applicable, to the limitations described in section 213(g) and § 1.213-2.
(ii) The age of a taxpayer shall be determined as of the last day of his taxable year. In the event of the taxpayer's death, his taxable year shall end as of the date of his death. The age of a taxpayer's spouse shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, except that, if the spouse dies within such taxable year, her age shall be determined as of the date of her death. Likewise, the age of the taxpayer's dependent who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year but not later than the date of death of such dependent.
(iii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, who attained the age of 65 on February 22, 1956, makes his return on the basis of the calendar year. During the year 1956, A had adjusted gross income of $8,000, and paid the following medical bills: (
a
) $560 (7 percent of adjusted gross income) for the medical care of himself and his spouse, and (
b
) $160 (2 percent of adjusted gross income) for the medical care of his dependent son. No part of these payments was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for 1956 is $560, the full amount of the medical expenses for the taxpayer and his spouse. No deduction is allowable for the amount of $160 paid for medical care of the dependent son since the amount of such payment (determined without regard to the payments for the care of the taxpayer and his spouse) does not exceed 3 percent of adjusted gross income.

# Example 2.
H and W, who have a dependent child, made a joint return for the calendar year 1956. H became 65 years of age on August 15, 1956. The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1956 was $40,000 and they paid in such year the following amounts for medical care: (
a
) $3,000 for the medical care of H; (
b
) $2,000 for the medical care of W; and (
c
) $3,000 for the medical care of the dependent child. No part of these payments was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical expenses paid in 1956 is $6,800 computed as follows:
Payments for medical care of H and W in 1956
$5,000
Payments for medical care of the dependent in 1956
$3,000
Less: 3 percent of $40,000 (adjusted gross income)
1,200
————
1,800
Allowable deduction for 1956
6,800

# Example 3.
D and his wife, E, made a joint income tax return for the calendar year 1962, and reported adjusted gross income of $30,000. On December 13, 1962, D attained the age of 65. During the year 1962, D's father, F, who was 87 years of age, received over half of his support from, and was a dependent (as defined in section 152) of, D. However, D could not claim an exemption under section 151 for F because F had gross income from rents in 1962 of $800. D paid the following medical expenses in 1962, none of which were compensated for by insurance or otherwise: hospital and doctor bills for D and E, $6,500; hospital and doctor bills for F, $4,850; medicine and drugs for D and E, $225, and for F, $225. Since none of the medical expenses are subject to the 3-percent limitation, the amount of medical expenses to be taken into account (before computing the maximum deduction) is $11,500, computed as follows:
Hospital and doctor bills—for D and E
$6,500
Hospital and doctor bills—for F
4,850
Medicine and drugs—for D and E
$225
Medicine and drugs—for F
$225
Total medicine and drugs
450
Less: 1 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)
300
Allowable expenses for medicine and drugs
$150
Total medical expenses taken into account
11,500
Since an exemption cannot be claimed for F on the 1962 return of D and E, their deduction for medical expenses (assuming that section 213(g) does not apply) is limited to $10,000 for that year ($5,000 multiplied by the two exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). If these identical facts had
occurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962, the medical expense deduction for D and E would, for such taxable year, be limited to $5,000 ($2,500 multiplied by the two exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). See paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that D furnished the entire support of his father's twin sister, G, who had no gross income during 1962 and for whom D was entitled to a dependency exemption. In addition, D paid $4,800 to doctors and hospitals during 1962 for the medical care of G. No part of the $4,800 was for medicine and drugs, and no amount was compensated for by insurance or otherwise. For purposes of the maximum limitation under section 213(c), the maximum deduction for medical expenses on the 1962 return of D and E is limited to $15,000 ($5,000 multiplied by 3, the number of exemptions allowed under section 151, exclusive of the exemptions for old age or blindness). If these identical facts had occurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962, the medical expense deduction for D and E would, for such taxable year, be limited to $7,500 ($2,500 multiplied by the three exemptions allowed under section 151, exclusive of the exemptions for old age or blindness). The medical expenses to be taken into account by D and E for 1962 and the maximum deductions allowable for such expenses are $15,400 and $15,000, respectively, computed as follows:
Medical expenses per
Example 3
$11,500
Add: Expenses paid for G
$4,800
Less: 3 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)
900

# Example 5.
Assume that the facts set forth in
Example 3
had occurred in respect of the calendar year 1964 rather than the calendar year 1962. Since both D and his father, F, had attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year, the 1-percent limitation does not apply to the amounts paid for medicine and drugs for D, E, and F. Accordingly, the total medical expenses taken into account by D and E for 1964 would be $11,800 (rather than $11,500 as in
Example 3
) computed as follows:
Hospital and doctor bills—for D and E
$6,500
Hospital and doctor bills—for F
4,350
Medicine and drugs—for D and E
225
Medicine and drugs—for F

Total medical expenses taken into account
11,800
(5)(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, there may be deducted without regard to the 3-percent limitation the lesser of—(a) One-half of the amounts paid during the taxable year for insurance which constitute expenses for medical care for the taxpayer, his spouse, and dependents; or (b) $150.
(ii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H and W made a joint return for the calendar year 1967. The adjusted gross income of H and W for 1967 was $10,000 and they paid in such year $370 for medical care of which amount $350 was paid for insurance which constitutes medical care for H and W. No part of the payment was for medicine and drugs or was compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical expenses paid in 1967 is $150, computed as follows:
(1) Lesser of $175 (one-half of amounts paid for insurance) or $150
$150
(2) Payments for medical care
$370
(3) Less line 1

(4) Medical expenses to be taken into account under 3-percent limitation (line 2 minus line 3)

(b)
Limitation with respect to medicine and drugs
—(1)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964.
(i) Amounts paid during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, for medicine and drugs are to be taken into account in computing the allowable deduction for medical expenses paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the aggregate of such amounts exceeds 1 percent of the adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Thus, if the aggregate of the amounts paid for medicine and drugs exceeds 1 percent of adjusted gross income, the excess is added to other medical expenses for the purpose of computing the medical expense deduction. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The taxpayer, a single individual with no dependents, had an adjusted gross income of $6,000 for the calendar year 1956. During 1956, he paid a doctor $300 for medical services, a hospital $100 for hospital care, and also spent $100 for medicine and drugs.
These payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956 is $260, computed as follows:
Payments for medical care in 1956:
Doctor
$300
Hospital
100
Medicine and drugs
$100
Less: 1 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income)
60
40
Total medical expenses taken into account
440
Less: 3 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income)
180
Allowable deduction for 1956
260
(ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the 1-percent limitation is applicable to all amounts paid by a taxpayer during the taxable year for medicine and drugs. Moreover, this limitation applies regardless of the fact that the amounts paid are for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer, his spouse, or dependent parent (the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse) who has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. In a case where either a taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 and the taxpayer pays an amount in excess of 1 percent of adjusted gross income for medicine and drugs for himself, his spouse, and his dependents, it is necessary to apportion the 1 percent of adjusted gross income (the portion which is not taken into account as expenses paid for medical care) between the taxpayer and his spouse on the one hand and his dependents on the other. The part of the 1 percent allocable to the taxpayer and his spouse is an amount which bears the same ratio to 1 percent of his adjusted gross income which the amount paid for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer and his spouse bears to the total amount paid for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer, his spouse, and his dependents. The balance of the 1 percent shall be allocated to his dependents. The amount paid for medicine and drugs in excess of the allocated part of the 1 percent shall be taken into account as payments for medical care for the taxpayer and his spouse on the one hand and his dependents on the other, respectively. A similar apportionment must be made in the case of a dependent parent (65 years of age or over) of the taxpayer or his spouse. The application of this subdivision (ii) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H and W, who have a dependent child, made a joint return for the calendar year 1956. H became 65 years of age on September 15, 1956. The adjusted gross income of H and W for 1956 is $10,000. During the year, H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i) $1,000 for doctors and hospital expenses and $180 for medicine and drugs for themselves; and (ii) $500 for doctors and hospital expenses and $140 for medicine and drugs for the dependent child. These payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213(a)(2) for medical expenses paid in 1956 is $1,420, computed as follows:
H and W:
Payments for doctors and hospital
$1,000.00
Payments for medicine and drugs
$180.00
Less: Limitation for medicine and drugs (see computation below)

(2)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, amounts paid during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, for medicine and drugs are to be taken into account in computing the allowable deduction for medical expenses paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the aggregate of such amounts exceeds 1 percent of the adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Thus, if the aggregate of the amounts paid for medicine and drugs which are subject to the 1-percent limitation exceeds 1 percent of adjusted gross income, the excess is added to other medical expenses for the purpose of computing the medical expense deduction.
(ii) The 1-percent limitation provided by section 213 does not apply to amounts paid by a taxpayer during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1967, for medicine and drugs for the medical care of the taxpayer and his spouse if either has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. Moreover, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1967, the 1-percent limitation with respect to medicine and drugs does not apply to amounts paid for the medical care of a dependent (as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse and who has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxpayer's taxable year. Amounts paid for medicine and drugs which are not subject to the limitation on medicine and drugs are added to other medical expenses of a taxpayer and his spouse or the dependent (as the case may be) for the purpose of computing the medical expense deduction.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
H and W, who have a dependent child, C, were both under 65 years of age at the close of the calendar year 1964 and made a joint return for that calendar year. During the year 1964, H's mother, M, attained the age of 65, and was a dependent (as defined in section 152) of H. The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1964 was $12,000. During 1964 H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i) $600 for doctors and hospital expenses and $120 for medicine and drugs for themselves; (ii) $350 for doctors and hospital expenses and $60 for medicine and drugs for C; and (iii) $400 for doctors and hospital expenses and $100 for medicine and drugs for M. These payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213(a) (1) for medical expenses paid in 1964 is $1,150, computed as follows:
H, W, and C:
Payments for doctors and hospital
$950
Payments for medicine and drugs

H and W, who have a dependent child, C, made a joint return for the calendar year 1964, and reported adjusted gross income of $12,000. H became 65 years of age on January 23, 1964. F, the 87 year old father of W, was a dependent of H. During 1964, H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i) $400 for doctors and hospital expenses and $75 for medicine and drugs for H; (ii) $200 for doctors and hospital expenses and $100 for medicine and drugs for W; (iii) $200 for doctors and hospital expenses and $175 for medicine and drugs for C; and (iv) $700 for doctors and hospital expenses and $150 for medicine and drugs for F. These payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213(a) (2) for medical expenses paid in 1964 is $1,625, computed as follows:

(1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, there shall be no maximum limitation on the amount of the deduction allowable for payment of medical expenses.
(2) Except as provided in section 213(g) and § 1.213-2 (relating to maximum limitations with respect to certain aged and disabled individuals for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967), for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1967, the maximum deduction allowable for medical expenses paid in any one taxable year is the lesser of:
(i) $5,000 multiplied by the number of exemptions allowed under section 151 (exclusive of exemptions allowed under section 151(c) for a taxpayer or spouse attaining the age of 65, or section 151(d) for a taxpayer who is blind or a spouse who is blind);
(ii) $10,000, if the taxpayer is single, not the head of a household (as defined in section 1(b) (2)) and not a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(b)), or is married and files a separate return; or
(iii) $20,000 if the taxpayer is married and files a joint return with his spouse under section 6013, or is the head of a household (as defined in section 1(b) (2)), or a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(b)).
(3) The application of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H and W made a joint return for the calendar year 1962 and were allowed five exemptions (exclusive of exemptions under sec. 151 (c) and (d)), one for each taxpayer and three for their dependents. The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1962 was $80,000. They paid during such year $26,000 for medical care, no part of which is compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1962 is $20,000, computed as follows:
Payments for medical care in 1962
$26,000
Less: 3 percent of $80,000 (adjusted gross income)
2,400
Excess of medical expenses in 1962 over 3 percent of adjusted gross income
23,600
Allowable deduction for 1962 ($5,000 multiplied by five exemptions allowed under sec. 151 (b) and (e) but not in excess of $20,000)
20,000
(4) Except as provided in section 213(g) and § 1.213-2 (relating to certain aged and disabled individuals), for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962, the maximum deduction allowable for medical expenses paid in any 1 taxable year is the lesser of:
(i) $2,500 multiplied by the number of exemptions allowed under section 151 (exclusive of exemptions allowed under section 151(c) for a taxpayer or spouse attaining the age of 65, or section 151(d) for a taxpayer who is blind or a spouse who is blind);
(ii) $5,000, if the taxpayer is single, not the head of a household (as defined in section 1(b) (2)) and not a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(b)) or is married and files a separate return; or
(iii) $10,000, if the taxpayer is married and files a joint return with his spouse under section 6013, or is head of a household (as defined in section 1(b) (2)), or a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(b)).
(5) For the maximum deduction allowable for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, if the taxpayer or his spouse is age 65 or over and is disabled, see § 1.213-2.
(d)
Special rule for decedents.
(1) For the purpose of section 213 (a), expenses for medical care of the taxpayer which are paid out of his estate during the 1-year period beginning with the day after the date of his death shall be treated as paid by the taxpayer at the time the medical services were rendered. However, no credit or refund of tax shall be allowed for any taxable year for which the statutory period for filing a claim has expired. See section 6511 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The rule prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply where the amount so paid is allowable under section 2053 as a deduction in computing the taxable estate of the decedent unless there is filed in duplicate (i) a statement that such amount has not been allowed as a deduction under section 2053 in computing the taxable estate of the decedent and (ii) a waiver of the right to have such amount allowed at any time as a deduction under section 2053. The statement and waiver shall be filed with or for association with the return, amended return, or claim for credit or refund for the decedent for any taxable year for which such an amount is claimed as a deduction.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
General.
(i) The term
medical care
includes the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Expenses paid for “medical care” shall include those paid for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body or for transportation primarily for and essential to medical care. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for provisions relating to medical insurance.
(ii) Amounts paid for operations or treatments affecting any portion of the body, including obstetrical expenses and expenses of therapy or X-ray treatments, are deemed to be for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body and are therefore paid for medical care. Amounts expended for illegal operations or treatments are not deductible. Deductions for expenditures for medical care allowable under section 213 will be confined strictly to expenses incurred primarily for the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. Thus, payments for the following are payments for medical care: hospital services, nursing services (including nurses' board where paid by the taxpayer), medical, laboratory, surgical, dental and other diagnostic and healing services, X-rays, medicine and drugs (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, subject to the 1-percent limitation in paragraph (b) of this section), artificial teeth or limbs, and ambulance hire. However, an expenditure which is merely beneficial to the general health of an individual, such as an expenditure for a vacation, is not an expenditure for medical care.
(iii) Capital expenditures are generally not deductible for Federal income tax purposes. See section 263 and the regulations thereunder. However, an expenditure which otherwise qualifies as a medical expense under section 213 shall not be disqualified merely because it is a capital expenditure. For purposes of section 213 and this paragraph, a capital expenditure made by the taxpayer may qualify as a medical expense, if it has as its primary purpose the medical care (as defined in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his spouse, or his dependent. Thus, a capital expenditure which is related only to the sick person and is not related to permanent improvement or betterment of property, if it otherwise qualifies as an expenditure for medical care, shall be deductible; for example, an expenditure for eye glasses, a seeing eye dog, artificial teeth and limbs, a wheel chair, crutches, an inclinator or an air conditioner which is detachable from the property and purchased only for the use of a sick person, etc. Moreover, a capital expenditure for permanent improvement or betterment of property which would not ordinarily be for the purpose of medical care (within the
meaning of this paragraph) may, nevertheless, qualify as a medical expense to the extent that the expenditure exceeds the increase in the value of the related property, if the particular expenditure is related directly to medical care. Such a situation could arise, for example, where a taxpayer is advised by a physician to install an elevator in his residence so that the taxpayer's wife who is afflicted with heart disease will not be required to climb stairs. If the cost of installing the elevator is $1,000 and the increase in the value of the residence is determined to be only $700, the difference of $300, which is the amount in excess of the value enhancement, is deductible as a medical expense. If, however, by reason of this expenditure, it is determined that the value of the residence has not been increased, the entire cost of installing the elevator would qualify as a medical expense. Expenditures made for the operation or maintenance of a capital asset are likewise deductible medical expenses if they have as their primary purpose the medical care (as defined in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his spouse, or his dependent. Normally, if a capital expenditure qualifies as a medical expense, expenditures for the operation or maintenance of the capital asset would also qualify provided that the medical reason for the capital expenditure still exists. The entire amount of such operation and maintenance expenditures qualifies, even if none or only a portion of the original cost of the capital asset itself qualified.
(iv) Expenses paid for transportation primarily for and essential to the rendition of the medical care are expenses paid for medical care. However, an amount allowable as a deduction for “transportation primarily for and essential to medical care” shall not include the cost of any meals and lodging while away from home receiving medical treatment. For example, if a doctor prescribes that a taxpayer go to a warm climate in order to alleviate a specific chronic ailment, the cost of meals and lodging while there would not be deductible. On the other hand, if the travel is undertaken merely for the general improvement of a taxpayer's health, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging would be deductible. If a doctor prescribes an operation or other medical care, and the taxpayer chooses for purely personal considerations to travel to another locality (such as a resort area) for the operation or the other medical care, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging (except where paid as part of a hospital bill) is deductible.
(v) The cost of in-patient hospital care (including the cost of meals and lodging therein) is an expenditure for medical care. The extent to which expenses for care in an institution other than a hospital shall constitute medical care is primarily a question of fact which depends upon the condition of the individual and the nature of the services he receives (rather than the nature of the institution). A private establishment which is regularly engaged in providing the types of care or services outlined in this subdivision shall be considered an institution for purposes of the rules provided herein. In general, the following rules will be applied:
(
a
) Where an individual is in an institution because his condition is such that the availability of medical care (as defined in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) in such institution is a principal reason for his presence there, and meals and lodging are furnished as a necessary incident to such care, the entire cost of medical care and meals and lodging at the institution, which are furnished while the individual requires continual medical care, shall constitute an expense for medical care. For example, medical care includes the entire cost of institutional care for a person who is mentally ill and unsafe when left alone. While ordinary education is not medical care, the cost of medical care includes the cost of attending a special school for a mentally or physically handicapped individual, if his condition is such that the resources of the institution for alleviating such mental or physical handicap are a principal reason for his presence there. In such a case, the cost of attending such a special school will include the cost of meals and lodging, if supplied, and the cost of ordinary education furnished
which is incidental to the special services furnished by the school. Thus, the cost of medical care includes the cost of attending a special school designed to compensate for or overcome a physical handicap, in order to qualify the individual for future normal education or for normal living, such as a school for the teaching of braille or lip reading. Similarly, the cost of care and supervision, or of treatment and training, of a mentally retarded or physically handicapped individual at an institution is within the meaning of the term
medical care.
(
b
) Where an individual is in an institution, and his condition is such that the availability of medical care in such institution is not a principal reason for his presence there, only that part of the cost of care in the institution as is attributable to medical care (as defined in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) shall be considered as a cost of medical care; meals and lodging at the institution in such a case are not considered a cost of medical care for purposes of this section. For example, an individual is in a home for the aged for personal or family considerations and not because he requires medical or nursing attention. In such case, medical care consists only of that part of the cost for care in the home which is attributable to medical care or nursing attention furnished to him; his meals and lodging at the home are not considered a cost of medical care.
(
c
) It is immaterial for purposes of this subdivision whether the medical care is furnished in a Federal or State institution or in a private institution.
(vi) See section 262 and the regulations thereunder for disallowance of deduction for personal living, and family expenses not falling within the definition of medical care.
(2)
Medicine and drugs.
The term
medicine and drugs
shall include only items which are legally procured and which are generally accepted as falling within the category of medicine and drugs (whether or not requiring a prescription). Such term shall not include toiletries or similar preparations (such as toothpaste, shaving lotion, shaving cream, etc.) nor shall it include cosmetics (such as face creams, deodorants, hand lotions, etc., or any similar preparation used for ordinary cosmetic purposes) or sundry items. Amounts expended for items which, under this subparagraph, are excluded from the term
medicine and drugs
shall not constitute amounts expended for “medical care”.
(3)
Status as spouse or dependent.
In the case of medical expenses for the care of a person who is the taxpayer's spouse or dependent, the deduction under section 213 is allowable if the status of such person as “spouse” or “dependent” of the taxpayer exists either at the time the medical services were rendered or at the time the expenses were paid. In determining whether such status as “spouse” exists, a taxpayer who is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of separate maintenance is not considered as married. Thus, payments made in June 1956 by A, for medical services rendered in 1955 to B, his wife, may be deducted by A for 1956 even though, before the payments were made, B may have died or in 1956 secured a divorce. Payments made in July 1956 by C, for medical services rendered to D in 1955 may be deducted by C for 1956 even though C and D were not married until June 1956.
(4)
Medical insurance.
(i)(
a
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, expenditures for insurance shall constitute expenses paid for medical care only to the extent that such amounts are paid for insurance covering expenses of medical care referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In the case of an insurance contract under which amounts are payable for other than medical care (as, for example, a policy providing an indemnity for loss of income or for loss of life, limb, or sight):
(
1
) No amount shall be treated as paid for insurance covering expenses of medical care referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph unless the charge for such insurance is either separately stated in the contract or furnished to the policyholder by the insurer in a separate statement,
(
2
) The amount taken into account as the amount paid for such medical insurance shall not exceed such charge, and
(
3
) No amount shall be treated as paid for such medical insurance if the
amount specified in the contract (or furnished to the policyholder by the insurer in a separate statement) as the charge for such insurance is unreasonably large in relation to the total charges under the contract.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts will be considered payable for other than medical care under the contract if the contract provides for the waiver of premiums upon the occurrence of an event. In determining whether a separately stated charge for insurance covering expenses of medical care is unreasonably large in relation to the total premium, the relationship of the coverages under the contract together with all of the facts and circumstances shall be considered. In determining whether a contract constitutes an “insurance” contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and clinical care are expenses paid for medical care. Premiums paid under Part B, title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j-1395w), relating to supplementary medical insurance benefits for the aged, are amounts paid for insurance covering expenses of medical care. Taxes imposed by any governmental unit do not, however, constitute amounts paid for such medical insurance.
(
b
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, subject to the rules of (
a
) of this subdivision, premiums paid during a taxable year by a taxpayer under the age of 65 for insurance covering expenses of medical care for the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent after the taxpayer attains the age of 65 are to be treated as expenses paid during the taxable year for insurance covering expenses of medical care if the premiums for such insurance are payable (on a level payment basis) under the contract:
(
1
) For a period of 10 years or more, or
(
2
) Until the year in which the taxpayer attains the age of 65 (but in no case for a period of less than 5 years).
For purposes of this subdivision (
b
), premiums will be considered payable on a level payment basis if the total premium under the contract is payable in equal annual or more frequent installments. Thus, a total premium of $10,000 payable over a period of 10 years at $1,000 a year shall be considered payable on a level payment basis.
(ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, expenses paid for medical care shall include amounts paid for accident or health insurance. In determining whether a contract constitutes an “insurance” contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and clinical care are expenses paid for medical care.
(f)
Exclusion of amounts allowed for care of certain dependents.
Amounts taken into account under section 44A in computing a credit for the care of certain dependents shall not be treated as expenses paid for medical care.
(g)
Reimbursement for expenses paid in prior years.
(1) Where reimbursement, from insurance or otherwise, for medical expenses is received in a taxable year subsequent to a year in which a deduction was claimed on account of such expenses, the reimbursement must be included in gross income in such subsequent year to the extent attributable to (and not in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 for any prior taxable year. See section 104, relating to compensation for injuries or sickness, and section 105(b), relating to amounts expended for medical care, and the regulations thereunder, with regard to amounts in excess of or not attributable to deductions allowed.
(2) If no medical expense deduction was taken in an earlier year, for example, if the standard deduction under section 141 was taken for the earlier year, the reimbursement received in the taxable year for the medical expense of the earlier year is not includible in gross income.
(3) In order to allow the same aggregate medical expense deductions as if
the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years had been received in the year in which the payments for medical care were made, the following rules shall be followed:
(i) If the amount of the reimbursement is equal to or less than the amount which was deducted in a prior year, the entire amount of the reimbursement shall be considered attributable to the deduction taken in such prior year (and hence includible in gross income); or
(ii) If the amount of the reimbursement received in such subsequent year or years is greater than the amount which was deducted for the prior year, that portion of the reimbursement received which is equal in amount to the deduction taken in the prior year shall be considered as attributable to such deduction (and hence includible in gross income); but
(iii) If the deduction for the prior year would have been greater but for the limitations on the maximum amount of such deduction provided by section 213 (c), then the amount of the reimbursement attributable to such deduction (and hence includible in gross income) shall be the amount of the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years reduced by the amount disallowed as a deduction because of the maximum limitation, but not in excess of the deduction allowed for the previous year.
(4) The application of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples.
Examples 1
and
2
reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense deduction applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961.
Examples 3
and
4
reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense deduction applicable to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1962. For explanation of such maximum medical expense limitations, see paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a single individual (not the head of a household and not a surviving spouse) with one dependent, is entitled to two exemptions under the provisions of section 151. He had an adjusted gross income of $35,000 for the calendar year 1962. During 1962 he paid $16,000 for medical care. A received no reimbursement for such medical expenses in 1962, but in 1963 he received $6,000 upon an insurance policy covering the medical expenses which he paid in 1962. A was allowed a deduction of $10,000 (the maximum) from his adjusted gross income for 1962. The amount which A must include in his gross income for 1963 is $1,050, and the amount to be excluded from gross income for 1963 is $4,950, computed as follows:
Payments for medical care in 1962 (not reimbursed in 1962)
$16,000
Less: 3 percent of $35,000 (adjusted gross income)

Reimbursement received in 1963
$15,000
Less: Amount by which the medical deduction for 1962 would have been greater than $10,000 but for the limitations on the maximum amount provided by section 213

# Example 3.
Taxpayer A, a single individual (not the head of a household and not a surviving spouse) with one dependent, is entitled to two exemptions under the provisions of section 151. He had an adjusted gross income of $35,000 for the calendar year 1956. During 1956 he paid $9,000 for medical care. A received no reimbursement for such medical
expenses in 1956, but in 1957 he received $6,000 upon an insurance policy covering the medical expenses which he paid in 1956. A was allowed a deduction of $5,000 (the maximum) from his adjusted gross income for 1956. The amount which A must include in his gross income for 1957 is $3,050 and the amount to be excluded from gross income for 1957 is $2,950, computed as follows:

Assuming that A, in example (3), received $8,000 in 1957 as reimbursement for the medical expenses which he paid in 1956, the amount which A must include in his gross income for 1957 is $5,000 and the amount to be excluded from gross income for 1957 is $3,000 computed as follows:
Reimbursement received in 1957
$8,000
Less: Amount by which the medical deduction for 1956 would have been greater than $5,000 but for the limitations on the maximum amount provided by section 213

(h)
Substantiation of deductions.
In connection with claims for deductions under section 213, the taxpayer shall furnish the name and address of each person to whom payment for medical expenses was made and the amount and date of the payment thereof in each case. If payment was made in kind, such fact shall be so reflected. Claims for deductions must be substantiated, when requested by the district director, by a statement or itemized invoice from the individual or entity to which payment for medical expenses was made showing the nature of the service rendered, and to or for whom rendered; the nature of any other item of expense and for whom incurred and for what specific purpose, the amount paid therefor and the date of the payment thereof; and by such other information as the district director may deem necessary.

§ 1.215-1
Periodic alimony, etc., payments.
(a) A deduction is allowable under section 215 with respect to periodic payments in the nature of, or in lieu of, alimony or an allowance for support actually paid by the taxpayer during his taxable year and required to be included in the income of the payee wife or former wife, as the case may be, under section 71. As to the amounts required to be included in the income of such wife or former wife, see section 71 and the regulations thereunder. For definition of
husband
and
wife
see section 7701(a) (17).
(b) The deduction under section 215 is allowed only to the obligor spouse. It is not allowed to an estate, trust, corporation, or any other person who may pay the alimony obligation of such obligor spouse. The obligor spouse, however, is not allowed a deduction for any periodic payment includible under section 71 in the income of the wife or former wife, which payment is attributable to property transferred in discharge of his obligation and which, under section 71(d) or section 682, is not includible in his gross income.
(c) The following examples, in which both H and W file their income tax returns on the basis of a calendar year, illustrate cases in which a deduction is or is not allowed under section 215:

# Example 1.
Pursuant to the terms of a decree of divorce, H, in 1956, transferred securities valued at $100,000 in trust for the benefit of W, which fully discharged all his obligations to W. The periodic payments made by the trust to W are required to be included in W's income under section 71. Such payments are stated in section 71(d) not to be includible in H's income and, therefore, under section 215 are not deductible from his income.

# Example 2.
A decree of divorce obtained by W from H incorporated a previous agreement of H to establish a trust, the trustees of which were instructed to pay W $5,000 a year for the remainder of her life. The court retained jurisdiction to order H to provide further payments if necessary for the support of W. In 1956 the trustee paid to W $4,000 from the income of the trust and $1,000 from the corpus of the trust. Under the provisions of sections 71 and 682(b), W would include $5,000 in her income for 1956. H would not include any part of the $5,000 in his income nor take a deduction therefor. If H had paid the $1,000 to W pursuant to court order rather than allowing the trustees to pay it out of corpus, he would have been entitled to a deduction of $1,000 under the provisions of section 215.

Alimony, etc., payments (temporary).
Q-1 What information is required by the Internal Revenue Service when an alimony or separate maintenance payment is claimed as a deduction by a payor?
A-1 The payor spouse must include on his/her first filed return of tax (Form 1040) for the taxable year in which the payment is made the payee's social security number, which the payee is required to furnish to the payor. For penalties applicable to a payor spouse who fails to include such information on his/her return of tax or to a payee spouse who fails to furnish his/her social security number to the payor spouse, see section 6676.

(1) The real estate taxes allowable as a deduction to the corporation under section 164 which are paid or incurred by the corporation before the close of the taxable year of the tenant-stockholder on the houses (or apartment building) and the land on which the houses (or apartment building) are situated, or
(2) The interest allowable as a deduction to the corporation under section 163 which is paid or incurred by the corporation before the close of the taxable year of the tenant-stockholder on its indebtedness contracted in the acquisition, construction, alteration, rehabilitation, or maintenance of the houses (or apartment building), or in the acquisition of the land on which the houses (or apartment building) are situated.
(b)
Limitation.
The deduction allowable under section 216 shall not exceed the amount of the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of the taxes and interest described therein. If a tenant-stockholder pays or incurs only a part of his proportionate share of such taxes and interest to the corporation, only the amount so paid or incurred which represents taxes and interest is allowable as a deduction under section 216. If a tenant-stockholder pays an amount, or incurs an obligation for an amount, to the corporation on account of such taxes and interest and other items, such as maintenance, overhead expenses, and reduction of mortgage indebtedness, the amount representing such taxes and interest is an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of the tenant-stockholder's payment or liability, as the case may be, as the total amount of the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of such taxes and interest bears to the total amount of the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of the
taxes, interest, and other items on account of which such payment is made or liability incurred. No deduction is allowable under section 216 for that part of amounts representing the taxes or interest described in that section which are deductible by a tenant-stockholder under any other provision of the Code.
(c)
Disallowance of deduction for certain payments to the corporation.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, no deduction shall be allowed to a stockholder during any taxable year for any amount paid or accrued to a cooperative housing corporation (in excess of the stockholder's proportionate share of the items described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section) which is allocable to amounts that are paid or incurred at any time by the cooperative housing corporation and which is chargeable to the corporation's capital account. Examples of expenditures chargeable to the corporation's capital account include the cost of paving a community parking lot, the purchase of a new boiler or roof, and the payment of the principal of the corporation's building mortgage. The adjusted basis of the stockholder's stock in such corporation shall be increased by the amount of such disallowance. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The X corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1988 X uses $275,000 that it received from its shareholders in such year to purchase and place in service a new boiler. The $275,000 will be chargeable to the corporation's capital account. A owns 10% of the shares of X and uses in a trade or business the dwelling unit appurtenant to A's shares and was responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the boiler. A is thus responsible for $27,500 of the cost of the boiler, which amount A will not be able to deduct currently. A will, however, add the $27,500 to A's basis for A's shares in X.
(d)
Tenant-stockholder's proportionate share
—(1)
General rule.
The tenant-stockholder's proportionate share is that proportion which the stock of the cooperative housing corporation owned by the tenant-stockholder is of the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including any stock held by the corporation. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, if the cooperative housing corporation had issued stock to a governmental unit, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, then in determining the total outstanding stock of the corporation, the governmental unit shall be deemed to hold the number of shares that it would have held, with respect to the apartments or houses it is entitled to occupy, if it had been a tenant-stockholder. That is, the number of shares the governmental unit is deemed to hold is determined in the same manner as if stock had been issued to it as a tenant-stockholder. For example, if a cooperative housing corporation requires each tenant-stockholder to buy one share of stock for each one thousand dollars of value of the apartment he is entitled to occupy, a governmental unit shall be deemed to hold one share of stock for each one thousand dollars of value of the apartments it is entitled to occupy, regardless of the number of shares formally issued to it.
(2)
Special rule
—(i)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, if a cooperative housing corporation allocates to each tenant-stockholder a portion of the real estate taxes or interest (or both) that reasonably reflects the cost to the corporation of the taxes or interest attributable to each tenant-stockholder's dwelling unit (and the unit's share of the common areas), the cooperative housing corporation may elect to treat the amounts so allocated as the tenant-stockholders' proportionate shares.
(ii)
Time and manner of making election.
The election referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is effective only if, by January 31 of the year following the first calendar year that includes any period to which the election applies, the cooperative housing corporation furnishes to each person that is a tenant-stockholder during that period a written statement showing the amount of real estate taxes or interest (or both) allocated to the tenant-stockholder with respect to the tenant-stockholder's dwelling unit or units and share of common areas for that period. The election must be made by attaching a statement to the corporation's timely filed tax return (taking extensions into account) for the
first taxable year for which the election is to be effective. The statement must contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the cooperative housing corporation, identify the election as an election under section 216(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Code, indicate whether the election is being made with respect to the allocation of real estate taxes or interest (or both), and include a description of the method of allocation being elected. The election applies for the taxable year and succeeding taxable years. It is revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner and will be binding on all tenant-stockholders.
(iii)
Reasonable allocation.
It is reasonable to allocate to each tenant-stockholder a portion of the real estate taxes or interest (or both) that bears the same ratio to the cooperative housing corporation's total interest or real estate taxes as the fair market value of each dwelling unit (including the unit's share of the common areas) bears to the fair market value of all the dwelling units with respect to which stock is outstanding (including stock held by the corporation) at the time of allocation. If real estate taxes are separately assessed on each dwelling unit by the relevant taxing authority, an allocation of real estates taxes to tenant-stockholders based on separate assessments is a reasonable allocation. If one or more of the tenant-stockholders prepays any portion of the principal of the indebtedness and gives rise to interest, an allocation of interest to those tenant-stockholders will be a reasonable allocation of interest if the allocation is reduced to reflect the reduction in the debt service attributable to the prepayment. In addition, similar kinds of allocations may also be reasonable, depending on the facts and circumstances.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1970, it acquires a building containing 40 category A apartments and 25 category B apartments, for $750,000. The value of each category A apartment is $12,500, and of each category B apartment is $10,000. X values each share of stock issued with respect to the category A apartments at $125, and sells 4,000 shares of its stock, along with the right to occupy the 40 category A apartments, to 40 tenant-stockholders for $500,000. X also sells 1,000 shares of nonvoting stock to G, a State housing authority qualifying as a governmental unit under paragraph (f) of this section, for $250,000. The purchase of this stock gives G the right to occupy all the category B apartments. G is deemed to hold the number of shares that it would have held if it had been a tenant-stockholder. G is therefore deemed to own 2,000 shares of stock of X. All stockholders are required to pay a specified part of the corporation's expenses. F, one of the tenant-stockholders, purchased 100 shares of the category A stock for $12,500 in order to obtain a right to occupy a category A apartment. Since there are 6,000 total shares deemed outstanding, F's proportionate share is 1/60 (100/6,000).

# Example 2.
The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1960 it acquired a housing development containing 100 detached houses, each house having the same value. X issued one share of stock to each of 100 tenant-stockholders, each share carrying the right to occupy one of the houses. In 1971 X redeemed 40 of its 100 shares. It then sold to G, a municipal housing authority qualifying as a governmental unit under paragraph (f) of this section, 1,000 shares of preferred stock and the right to occupy the 40 houses with respect to which the stock had been redeemed. X sold the preferred stock to G for an amount equal to the cost of redeeming the 40 shares. G also agreed to pay 40 percent of X's expenses. For purposes of determining the total stock which X has outstanding, G is deemed to hold 40 shares of X.

# Example 3.
The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires for $1,000,000 a building containing 10 category A apartments, 10 category B apartments, and 10 category C apartments. The value of each category A apartment is $20,000, of each category B apartment is $30,000 and of each category C apartment is $50,000. X issues 1 share of stock to each of the 30 tenant-stockholders, each share carrying the right to occupy one of the apartments. X allocates the real estate taxes and interest to the tenant-stockholders on the basis of the fair market value of their respective apartments. Since the total fair market value of all of the apartments is $1,000,000, the allocation of taxes and interest to each tenant-stockholder that has the right to occupy a category A apartment is 2/100 ($20,000/$1,000,000). Similarly, the allocation of taxes and interest to each tenant-stockholder who has a right to occupy a category B apartment is 3/100 ($30,000/$1,000,000) and of a category C apartment is 5/100 ($50,000/$1,000,000). X may elect in accordance with the rules described
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to treat the amounts so allocated as each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest.

# Example 4.
The Y Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires a housing development containing 5 detached houses for $1,500,000, incurring an indebtedness of $1,000,000 for the purchase of the property. Each house is valued at $300,000, although the shares appurtenant to those houses have been sold to tenant-stockholders for $100,000. Y issues one share of stock to each of the five tenant-stockholders, each share carrying the right to occupy one of the houses. A, a tenant-stockholder, prepays all of the corporation's indebtedness allocable to A's house. The periodic charges payable to Y by A are reduced commensurately with the reduction in Y's debt service. Because no part of the indebtedness remains outstanding with respect to A's house, A's share of the interest expense is $0. The other four tenant-stockholders do not prepay their share of the indebtedness. Accordingly,
1/4
of the interest is allocated to each of the tenant-stockholders other than A. Y may elect in accordance with the rules described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to treat the amounts so allocated as each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of interest.

# Example 5.
The Z Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires a building containing 10 apartments. One of the apartments is occupied by a senior citizen. Under local law, a senior citizen who owns and occupies a residential apartment is entitled to a $500 reduction in local property taxes assessed upon the apartment. As a result, Z corporation is eligible under local law for a reduction in local property taxes assessed upon the building. Z's real estate tax assessment for the year would have been $10,000, however, with the senior citizen reduction, the assessment is $9,500. The proprietary lease provides for a reduced maintenance fee to the senior citizen tenant-stockholder in accordance with the real estate tax reduction. Accordingly, each apartment owner is assessed $1,000 for local real estate taxes, except the senior citizen tenant-stockholder, who is assessed $500. Z may elect in accordance with the rules described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to treat the amounts so allocated as each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of taxes.
(e)
Cooperative housing corporation.
In order to qualify as a “cooperative housing corporation” under section 216, the requirements of subparagraphs (1) through (4) of this paragraph must be met.
(1)
One class of stock.
The corporation shall have one and only one class of stock outstanding. However, a special classification of preferred stock, in a nominal amount not exceeding $100, issued to a Federal housing agency or other governmental agency solely for the purpose of creating a security device on the mortgage indebtedness of the corporation, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the corporation has one class of stock outstanding and such agency will not be considered a stockholder for purposes of section 216 and this section. Furthermore, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, a special class of stock issued to a governmental unit, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, shall also be disregarded for purposes of this paragraph in determining whether the corporation has one class of stock outstanding.
(2)
Right of occupancy.
Each stockholder of the corporation, whether or not the stockholder qualifies as a tenant-stockholder under section 216(b)(2) and paragraph (f) of this section, must be entitled to occupy for dwelling purposes an apartment in a building or a unit in a housing development owned or leased by such corporation. The stockholder is not required to occupy the premises. The right as against the corporation to occupy the premises is sufficient. Such right must be conferred on each stockholder solely by reasons of his or her ownership of stock in the corporation. That is, the stock must entitle the owner thereof either to occupy the premises or to a lease of the premises. The fact that the right to continue to occupy the premises is dependent upon the payment of charges to the corporation in the nature of rentals or assessments is immaterial. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, the fact that, by agreement with the cooperative housing corporation, a person or his nominee may not occupy the house or apartment without the prior approval of such corporation will not be taken into account for purposes of this paragraph in the following cases.
(i) In any case where a person acquires stock of the cooperative housing
corporation by operation of law, by inheritance, or by foreclosure (or by instrument in lieu of foreclosure),
(ii) In any case where a person other than an individual acquires stock in the cooperative housing corporation, and
(iii) In any case where the person from whom the corporation has acquired the apartments or houses (or leaseholds therein) acquires any stock of the cooperative housing corporation from the corporation not later than one year after the date on which the apartments or houses (or leaseholds therein) are transferred to the corporation by such person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section will not apply to acquisitions of stock by foreclosure by the person from whom the corporation has acquired the apartments or houses (or leaseholds therein).
(3)
Distributions.
None of the stockholders of the corporation may be entitled, either conditionally or unconditionally, except upon a complete or partial liquidation of the corporation, to receive any distribution other than out of earnings and profits of the corporation.
(4)
Gross income.
Eighty percent or more of the gross income of the corporation for the taxable year of the corporation in which the taxes and interest are paid or incurred must be derived from the tenant-stockholders. For purposes of the 80-percent test, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, gross income attributable to any house or apartment which a governmental unit is entitled to occupy, pursuant to a lease or stock ownership, shall be disregarded.
(f)
Tenant-stockholder.
The term
tenant-stockholder
means a person that is a stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, as defined in section 216(b)(1) and paragraph (e) of this section, and whose stock is fully paid up in an amount at least equal to an amount shown to the satisfaction of the district director as bearing a reasonable relationship to the portion of the fair market value, as of the date of the original issuance of the stock, of the corporation's equity in the building and the land on which it is situated that is attributable to the apartment or housing unit which such person is entitled to occupy (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, tenant-stockholders include only individuals, certain lending institutions, and certain persons from whom the cooperative housing corporation has acquired the apartments or houses (or leaseholds thereon).
(g)
Governmental unit.
For purposes of section 216(b) and this section, the term
governmental unit
means the United States or any of its possessions, a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing empowered to acquire shares in a cooperative housing corporation for the purpose of providing housing facilities.
(h)
Examples.
The application of section 216(a) and (b) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples, which refer to apartments but which are equally applicable to housing units:

# Example 1.
The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216. In 1970, at a total cost of $200,000, it purchased a site and constructed thereon a building with 15 apartments. The fair market value of the land and building was $200,000 at the time of completion of the building. The building contains five category A apartment units, each of equal value, and 10 category B apartment units. The total value of all of the category A apartment units is $100,000. The total value of all of the category B apartments is also $100,000. Upon completion of the building, the X Corporation mortgaged the land and building for $100,000, and sold its total authorized capital stock for $100,000. The stock attributable to the category A apartments was purchased by five individuals, each of whom paid $10,000 for 100 shares, or $100 a share. Each certificate for 100 shares of such stock provides that the holder thereof is entitled to a lease of a particular apartment in the building for a specified term of years. The stock attributable to the category B apartments was purchased by a governmental unit for $50,000. Since the shares sold to the tenant-stockholders are valued at $100 per share, the governmental unit is deemed to hold a total of 500 shares. The certificate of such stock provides that the governmental unit is entitled to a lease of all of the category B apartments. All leases provide that the lessee shall pay his proportionate part of the corporation's expenses. In 1970 the original
owner of 100 shares of stock attributable to the category A apartments and to the lease to apartment No. 1 made a gift of the stock and lease to A, an individual. The taxable year of A and of the X Corporation is the calendar year. The corporation computes its taxable income on an accrual method, while A computes his taxable income on the cash receipts and disbursements method. In 1971, the X Corporation incurred expenses aggregating $13,800, including $4,000 for the real estate taxes on the land and building, and $5,000 for the interest on the mortgage. In 1972, A pays the X Corporation $1,380, representing his proportionate part of the expenses incurred by the corporation. The entire gross income of the X Corporation for 1971 was derived from the five tenant-stockholders and from the governmental unit. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of $900 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is computed as follows:
Shares of X Corporation owned by A
100
Shares of X Corporation owned by four other tenant-stockholders
400
Shares of X Corporation deemed owned by governmental unit
500
Total shares of X Corporation outstanding
1,000
A's proportionate share of the stock of X Corporation (100/1,000)
1/10
Expenses incurred by X Corporation:
Real estate taxes
$4,000
Interest
5,000
Other
4,800
Total
$13,800
Amount paid by A
1,380
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000)
$900
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800)
1,380
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and interest (900/1,380 of $1,380)
$900
A's allowable deduction
$900
Since the stock which A acquired by gift was fully paid up by his donor in an amount equal to the portion of the fair market value, as of the date of the original issuance of the stock, of the corporation's equity in the land and building which is attributable to apartment No. 1, the requirement of section 216 in this regard is satisfied. The fair market value at the time of the gift of the corporation's equity attributable to the apartment is immaterial.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that the building constructed by the X Corporation contained, in addition to the 15 apartments, business space on the ground floor, which the corporation rented at $2,400 for the calendar year 1971. The corporation deducted the $2,400 from its expenses in determining the amount of the expenses to be prorated among its tenant-stockholders. The amount paid by A to the corporation in 1972 is $1,140 instead of $1,380. More than 80 percent of the gross income of the corporation for 1971 was derived from tenant-stockholders. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of $743.48 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is computed as follows:
Expenses incurred by X Corporation
$13,800.00
Less: Rent from business space
2,400.00
Expenses to be prorated among tenant-stockholders
$11,400.00
Amount paid by A
1,140.00
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000)
900.00
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800)
1,380.00
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and interest (900/1380 of $1,140)
743.48
A's allowable deduction
743.48
Since the portion of A's payment allocable to real estate taxes and interest is only $743.48, that amount instead of $900 is allowable as a deduction in computing A's taxable income for 1972.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that the amount paid by A to the X Corporation in 1972 is $1,000 instead of $1,380. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of $652.17 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is computed as follows:
Amount paid by A
$1,000.00
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000)
900.00
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800)
1,380.00
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and interest (900/1380 of $1,000)
652.17
A's allowable deduction
652.17
Since the portion of A's payment allocable to real estate taxes and interest is only $652.17, that amount instead of $900 is allowable as a deduction in computing A's taxable income for 1972.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that X Corporation leases recreational facilities from Y Corporation for use by the tenant-stockholders of X. Under the terms of the lease, X is obligated to pay an annual rental of $5,000 plus all real estate taxes assessed against the facilities. In 1971 X paid, in addition to the $13,800 of expenses enumerated in
Example 1,
$5,000 rent and $1,000 real estate taxes. In 1972 A pays the X Corporation $2,000, no part of which is refunded to him in 1972. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of $900 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is computed as follows:
Expenses to be prorated among tenant-stockholders
$19,800
Amount paid by A
2,000
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000)
900
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $19,800)
1,980
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and interest (900/1,980 of $1,980)
900
A's allowable deduction
900
The $1,000 of real estate taxes assessed against the recreational facilities constitutes additional rent and hence is not deductible by A as taxes under section 216. A's allowable deduction is limited to his proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on stock ownership and cannot be increased by the payment of an amount in excess of his proportionate share.
[T.D. 7092, 36 FR 4597, Mar. 10, 1971; 36 FR 4985, Mar. 16, 1971, as amended by T.D. 8316, 55 FR 42004, Oct. 17, 1990]
§ 1.216-2
Treatment as property subject to depreciation.
(a)
General rule.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, stock in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined by section 216(b) (1) and paragraph (c) of § 1.216-1) owned by a tenant-stockholder (as defined by section 216(b) (2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.216-1) who uses the proprietary lease or right of tenancy, which was conferred on him solely by reason of his ownership of such stock, in a trade or business or for the production of income shall be treated as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) in the manner and to the extent prescribed in this section.
(b)
Determination of allowance for depreciation
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the special rules provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph and the limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year with respect to stock of a tenant-stockholder, subject to the extent provided in this section to an allowance for depreciation, shall be determined:
(i) By computing the amount of depreciation (amortization in the case of a leasehold) which would be allowable under one of the methods of depreciation prescribed in section 167(b) and the regulations thereunder (in paragraph (a) of § 1.162-11 and § 1.167(a)-4 in the case of a leasehold) in respect of the depreciable (amortizable) real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which such tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy,
(ii) By reducing the amount of depreciation (amortization) so computed in the same ratio as the rentable space in such property which is not subject to a proprietary lease or right of tenancy by reason of stock ownership but which is held for rental purposes bears to the total rentable space in such property, and
(iii) By computing such tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of such annual depreciation (amortization), so reduced.
As used in this section, the terms
depreciation
and
depreciable real property
include amortization and amortizable leasehold of real property. As used in this section, the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share is that proportion which stock of the cooperative housing corporation owned by the tenant-stockholder is of the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including any stock held by the corporation. In order to determine whether a tenant-stockholder may use one of the methods of depreciation prescribed in section 167(b) (2), (3), or (4) for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the limitations provided in section 167(c) on the use of such methods of depreciation shall be applied with respect to the depreciable real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which the tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy, rather than with respect to the stock in the cooperative housing corporation owned by the tenant-stockholder or with respect to the proprietary lease or right of tenancy conferred on the tenant-stockholder by reason of his ownership of such stock. The allowance for depreciation determined under this subparagraph shall be properly adjusted where only a portion of the property occupied under a proprietary lease or right of tenancy is used in a trade or business or for the production of income.
(2)
Stock acquired subsequent to first offering.
Except as provided in subparagraph (3), in the case of a tenant-stockholder who purchases stock other than
as part of the first offering of stock by the corporation, the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be the amount obtained by:
(i) Multiplying the taxpayer's cost per share by the total number of outstanding shares of stock of the corporation, including any shares held by the corporation,
(ii) Adding thereto the mortgage indebtedness to which such depreciable real property is subject on the date of purchase of such stock, and
(iii) Subtracting from the sum so obtained the portion thereof not properly allocable as of the date such stock was purchased to the depreciable real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which such tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy.
In order to prevent an overstatement or understatement of the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, appropriate adjustment for purposes of the computations described in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall be made in respect of prepayments and delinquencies on account of the corporation's mortgage indebtedness. Thus, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer's cost per share shall be reduced by an amount determined by dividing the total mortgage indebtedness prepayments in respect of the shares purchased by the taxpayer by the number of such shares. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the mortgage indebtedness shall be increased by the sum of all prepayments applied in reduction of the mortgage indebtedness and shall be decreased by any amount due under the terms of the mortgage and unpaid.

Conversion subsequent to date of acquisition.
In the case of a tenant-stockholder whose proprietary lease or right of tenancy is converted, in whole or in part, to use in a trade or business or for the production of income on a date subsequent to the date on which he acquired the stock conferring on him such lease or right of tenancy, the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be the fair market value of such depreciable real property on the date of the conversion if the fair market value is less than the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the cooperative housing corporation provided in section 1011 without taking into account any adjustment for depreciation required by section 1016(a)(2). Such fair market value shall be deemed to be equal to the adjusted basis of such property, taking into account adjustments required by section 1016(a)(2) computed as if the corporation had used the straight line method of depreciation, in the absence of evidence establishing that the fair market value so attributed to the property is unrealistic. In the case of a tenant-stockholder who purchases stock other than as part of the first offering of stock of the corporation, and at a later date converts his proprietary lease to use for business or production of income:
(i) The adjusted basis of the cooperative housing corporation's depreciable real property without taking into account any adjustment for depreciation shall be the amount determined in accordance with subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and
(ii) The fair market value shall be deemed to be equal to such adjusted basis reduced by the amount of depreciation, computed under the straight line method, which would have been allowable in respect of depreciable real property having a cost or other basis equal to the amount representing such adjusted basis in the absence of evidence establishing that the fair market value so attributed to the property is unrealistic.
(c)
Limitation.
If the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section exceeds the adjusted basis (provided in section 1011) of the stock described in paragraph (a) of this section allocable to the tenant-stockholder's proprietary lease or right of tenancy used in a trade or business or for the production of income, such excess is not allowable as a deduction. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, such
excess, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c), is allowable as a deduction for depreciation in the succeeding taxable year. To determine the portion of the adjusted basis of such stock which is allocable to such proprietary lease or right of tenancy, the adjusted basis is reduced by taking into account the same factors as are taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in determining the allowance for depreciation.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of section 216(c) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The Y corporation, a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of section 216, in 1961 purchased a site and constructed thereon a building with 10 apartments at a total cost of $250,000 ($200,000 being allocable to the building and $50,000 being allocable to the land). Such building was completed on January 1, 1962, and at that time had an estimated useful life of 50 years, with an estimated salvage value of $20,000. Each apartment is of equal value. Upon completion of the building, Y corporation mortgaged the land and building for $150,000 and sold its total authorized capital stock, consisting of 1000 shares of common stock, for $100,000. The stock was purchased by 10 individuals each of whom paid $10,000 for 100 shares. Each certificate for 100 shares provides that the holder thereof is entitled to a proprietary lease of a particular apartment in the building. Each lease provides that the lessee shall pay his proportionate share of the corporation's expenses including an amount on account of the curtailment of Y's mortgage indebtedness. B, a calendar year taxpayer, is the original owner of 100 shares of stock in Y corporation. On January 1, 1962, B subleases his apartment for a term of 5 years. B's stock in Y corporation is treated as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a), and B, who uses the straight line method of depreciation for purposes of the computation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, computes the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year 1962 with respect to such stock as follows:
Y's basis in the building
$200,000
Less: Estimated salvage value
$20,000
Y's basis for depreciation
$180,000
Annual straight line depreciation on Y's building (1/50 of $180,000)

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that the building constructed by Y corporation contained, in addition to the 10 apartments, space on the ground floor for 2 stores which were rented to persons who do not have a proprietary lease of such space by reason of stock ownership. Y corporation's building has a total area of 16,000 square feet, the 10 apartments in such building have an area of 10,000 square feet, and the 2 stores on the ground floor have an area of 2,000 square feet. Thus, the total rentable space in Y corporation's building is 12,000 square feet. B, who uses the straight line method of depreciation for purposes of the computation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, computes the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year 1962 with respect to his stock in Y corporation as follows:
Y's basis in the building
$200,000
Less: Estimated salvage value
20,000
Y's basis for depreciation
180,000
Annual straight line depreciation on Y's building (1/50 of $180,000)

The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that B occupies his apartment from January 1, 1962, until December 31, 1966, and that on January 1, 1967, B sells his stock to C, an individual, for $15,000. C thereby obtains a proprietary lease from Y corporation with the same rights and obligations as B's lease provided. Y corporation's records disclose that its outstanding mortgage indebtedness is $135,000 on January 1, 1967. C, a physician, uses the entire apartment solely as an office. C's stock in Y corporation is treated as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a), and C, who uses the straight line method of depreciation for purposes of the computation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, computes the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year 1967 with respect to such stock as follows:
Price paid for each share of stock in Y corporation purchased by C on 1-1-67 ($15,000 ÷ 100)
$150
Per share price paid by C multiplied by total shares of stock in Y corporation outstanding on 1-1-67 ($150 × 1,000)

§ 1.217-1
Deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
(a)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(a) allows a deduction from gross income for moving expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with the commencement of work as an employee at a new principal place of work. Except as provided in section 217, no deduction is allowable for any expenses incurred by the taxpayer in connection with moving himself, the members of his family or household, or household goods and personal effects. The deduction allowable under this section is only for expenses incurred after December 31, 1963, in taxable years ending after such date and beginning before January 1, 1970, except in cases where a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (g) of § 1.217-2 with respect to moving expenses paid or incurred before January 1, 1971, in connection with the commencement of work by such taxpayer as an employee at a new principal place of work of which such taxpayer has been notified by his employer on or before December 19, 1969. To qualify for the deduction the expenses must meet the definition of the term “moving expenses” provided in section 217(b); the taxpayer must meet the conditions set forth in section 217(c); and, if the taxpayer receives a reimbursement or other expense allowance for an item of expense, the deduction for the portion of the expense reimbursed is allowable only to the extent that such reimbursement or other expense allowance is included in his gross income as provided in section 217(e). The deduction is allowable only to a taxpayer who pays or incurs moving expenses in connection with his commencement of work as an employee and is not allowable to a taxpayer who pays or incurs such expenses in connection with his commencement of work as a self-employed individual. The term
employee
as used in this section has the same meaning as in § 31.3401(c)-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations). All references to section 217 in this section are to section 217 prior to the effective date of section 231 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577).
(2)
Commencement of work.
To be deductible, the moving expenses must be paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the commencement of work by him at a new principal place of work (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for a discussion of the term
principal place of work
). While it is not necessary that the taxpayer have a contract or commitment of employment prior to his moving to a new location, the deduction is not allowable unless employment actually does occur. The term
commencement
includes (i) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for the first time or after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment, (ii) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for a different employer, or (iii) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for the same employer at a new location. To qualify as being in connection with the commencement of work, the move for which moving expenses are incurred must bear a reasonable proximity both in time and place to such commencement. In general, moving expenses incurred within one year of the date of the commencement of work are considered to be reasonably proximate to such commencement. Moving expenses incurred in relocating the taxpayer's residence to a location which is farther from his new principal place of work than was his former residence are not generally to be considered as incurred in connection with such commencement of work. For example, if A is transferred by his employer from place X to place Y and A's old residence while he worked at place
X is 25 miles from Y, A will not generally be entitled to deduct moving expenses in moving to a new residence 40 miles from Y even though the minimum distance limitation contained in section 217(c)(1) is met. If, however, A is required, as a condition of his employment, to reside at a particular place, or if such residency will result in an actual decrease in his commuting time or expense, the expenses of the move may be considered as incurred in connection with his commencement of work at place Y.
(b)
Definition of moving expenses
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(b) defines the term
moving expenses
to mean only the reasonable expenses (i) of moving household goods and personal effects from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence, and (ii) of traveling (including meals and lodging) from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence. The test of deductibility thus is whether the expenses are reasonable and are incurred for the items set forth in (i) and (ii) above.
(2)
Reasonable expenses.
(i) The term
moving expenses
includes only those expenses which are reasonable under the circumstances of the particular move. Generally, expenses are reasonable only if they are paid or incurred for movement by the shortest and most direct route available from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence by the conventional mode or modes of transportation actually used and in the shortest period of time commonly required to travel the distance involved by such mode. Expenses paid or incurred in excess of a reasonable amount are not deductible. Thus, if moving or travel arrangements are made to provide a circuitous route for scenic, stopover, or other similar reasons, the additional expenses resulting therefrom are not deductible since they do not meet the test of reasonableness.
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, an employee of the M Company works and maintains his principal residence in Boston, Massachusetts. Upon receiving orders from his employer that he is to be transferred to M's Los Angeles, California office, A motors to Los Angeles with his family with stopovers at various cities between Boston and Los Angeles to visit friends and relatives. In addition, A detours into Mexico for sight-seeing. Because of the stopovers and tour into Mexico, A's travel time and distance are increased over what they would have been had he proceeded directly to Los Angeles. To the extent that A's route of travel between Boston and Los Angeles is in a generally southwesterly direction it may be said that he is traveling by the shortest and most direct route available by motor vehicle. Since A's excursion into Mexico is away from the usual Boston-Los Angeles route, the portion of the expenses paid or incurred attributable to such excursion is not deductible. Likewise, that portion of the expenses attributable to A's delays en route not necessitated by reasons of rest or repair of his vehicle are not deductible.
(3)
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects.
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects include expenses of transporting such goods and effects owned by the taxpayer or a member of his household from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence, and expenses of packing, crating and in-transit storage and insurance for such goods and effects. Expenses paid or incurred in moving household goods and personal effects to a taxpayer's new residence from a place other than his former residence are allowable, but only to the extent that such expenses do not exceed the amount which would be allowable had such goods and effects been moved from the taxpayer's former residence. Examples of items not deductible as moving expenses include, but are not limited to, storage charges (other than in-transit), costs incurred in the acquisition of property, costs incurred and losses sustained in the disposition of property, penalties for breaking leases, mortgage penalties, expenses of refitting rugs or draperies, expenses of connecting or disconnecting utilities, losses sustained on the disposal of memberships in clubs, tuition fees, and similar items.
(4)
Expenses of traveling.
Expenses of traveling include the cost of transportation and of meals and lodging en route (including the date of arrival) of both the taxpayer and members of his household, who have both the taxpayer's former residence and the taxpayer's new residence as their principal place of abode, from the taxpayer's
former residence to his new place of residence. Expenses of traveling do not include, for example: living or other expenses of the taxpayer and members of his household following their date of arrival at the new place of residence and while they are waiting to enter the new residence or waiting for their household goods to arrive; expenses in connection with house or apartment hunting; living expenses preceding the date of departure for the new place of residence; expenses of trips for purposes of selling property; expenses of trips to the former residence by the taxpayer pending the move by his family to the new place of residence; or any allowance for depreciation. The deduction for traveling expenses is allowable for only one trip made by the taxpayer and members of his household; however, it is not necessary that the taxpayer and all members of his household travel together or at the same time.
(5)
Residence.
The term
former residence
refers to the taxpayer's principal residence before his departure for his new principal place of work. The term
new residence
refers to the taxpayer's principal residence within the general location of his new principal place of work. Thus, neither term includes other residences owned or maintained by the taxpayer or members of his family or seasonal residences such as a summer beach cottage. Whether or not property is used by the taxpayer as his residence, and whether or not property is used by the taxpayer as his principal residence (in the case of a taxpayer using more than one property as a residence), depends upon all the facts and circumstances in each case. Property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence may include a houseboat, a house trailer, or similar dwelling. The term
new place of residence
generally includes the area within which the taxpayer might reasonably be expected to commute to his new principal place of work. The application of the terms
former residence, new residence
and
new place of residence
as defined in this paragraph and as used in section 217(b)(1) may be illustrated in the following manner: Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects are moving expenses when paid or incurred for transporting such items from the taxpayer's former residence to the taxpayer's new residence (such as from one street address to another). Expenses of traveling, on the other hand, are limited to those incurred between the taxpayer's former residence (a geographic point) and his new place of residence (a commuting area) up to and including the date of arrival. The date of arrival is the day the taxpayer secures lodging within that commuting area, even if on a temporary basis.
(6)
Individuals other than taxpayer.
In addition to the expenses set forth in section 217(b)(1) which are attributable to the taxpayer alone, the same type of expenses attributable to certain individuals other than the taxpayer, if paid or incurred by the taxpayer, are deductible. Those other individuals must (i) be members of the taxpayer's household, and (ii) have both the taxpayer's former residence and his new residence as their principal place of abode. A member of the taxpayer's household may not be, for example, a tenant residing in the taxpayer's residence, nor an individual such as a servant, governess, chauffeur, nurse, valet, or personal attendant.
(c)
Conditions for allowance
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(c) provides two conditions which must be satisfied in order for a deduction of moving expenses to be allowed under section 217(a). The first is a minimum distance requirement prescribed by section 217(c)(1), and the second is a minimum period of employment requirement prescribed by section 217(c)(2).
(2)
Minimum distance.
For purposes of applying the minimum distance requirement of section 217(c)(1) all taxpayers are divided into one or the other of the following categories: taxpayers having a former principal place of work, and taxpayers not having a former principal place of work. In this latter category are individuals who are seeking full-time employment for the first time (for example, recent high school or college graduates), or individuals who are re-entering the labor force after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment.
(i) In the case of a taxpayer having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(A) provides that no deduction
is allowable unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his former residence exceeds by at least 20 miles the distance between his former principal place of work and such former residence.
(ii) In the case of a taxpayer not having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(B) provides that no deduction is allowable unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his former residence is at least 20 miles.
(iii) For purposes of measuring distances under section 217(c)(1) all computations are to be made on the basis of a straight-line measurement.
(3)
Principal place of work.
(i) A taxpayer's “principal place of work” usually is the place at which he spends most of his working time. Generally, where a taxpayer performs services as an employee, his principal place of work is his employer's plant, office, shop, store or other property. However, a taxpayer may have a principal place of work even if there is no one place at which he spends a substantial portion of his working time. In such case, the taxpayer's principal place of work is the place at which his business activities are centered—for example, because he reports there for work, or is otherwise required either by his employer or the nature of his employment to “base” his employment there. Thus, while a member of a railroad crew, for example, may spend most of his working time aboard a train, his principal place of work is his home terminal, station, or other such central point where he reports in, checks out, or receives instructions. In those cases where the taxpayer is employed by a number of employers on a relatively short-term basis, and secures employment by means of a union hall system (such as a construction or building trades worker), the taxpayer's principal place of work would be the union hall.
(ii) In cases where a taxpayer has more than one employment (i.e., more than one employer at any particular time) his principal place of work is usually determined with reference to his principal employment. The location of a taxpayer's principal place of work is necessarily a question of fact which must be determined on the basis of the particular circumstances in each case. The more important factors to be considered in making a factual determination regarding the location of a taxpayer's principal place of work are (
a
) the total time ordinarily spent by the taxpayer at each place, (
b
) the degree of the taxpayer's business activity at each place, and (
c
) the relative significance of the financial return to the taxpayer from each place.
(iii) In general, a place of work is not considered to be the taxpayer's principal place of work for purposes of this section if the taxpayer maintains an inconsistent position, for example, by claiming an allowable deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) for traveling expenses “while away from home” with respect to expenses incurred while he is not away from such place of work and after he has incurred moving expenses for which a deduction is claimed under this section.
(4)
Minimum period of employment.
Under section 217(c)(2), no deduction is allowed unless, during the 12-month period immediately following the taxpayer's arrival in the general location of his new principal place of work, he is a full-time employee, in such general location, during at least 39 weeks.
(i) The 12-month period and the 39-week period set forth in section 217(c)(2) are measured from the date of the taxpayer's arrival in the general location of his new principal place of work. Generally, the taxpayer's date of arrival is the date of the termination of the last trip preceding the taxpayer's commencement of work on a regular basis, regardless of the date on which the taxpayer's family or household goods and effects arrive.
(ii) It is not necessary that the taxpayer remain in the employ of the same employer for 39 weeks, but only that he be employed in the same general location of his new principal place of work during such period. The
general location
of the new principal place of work refers to the area within which an individual might reasonably be expected to commute to such place of work, and will usually be the same
area as is known as the
new place of residence
; see paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(iii) Only a week during which the taxpayer is a full-time employee qualifies as a week of work for purposes of the 39-week requirement of section 217(c)(2). Whether an employee is a full-time employee during any particular week depends upon the customary practices of the occupation in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works. In the case of occupations where employment is on a seasonal basis, weeks occuring in the off-season when no work is required or available (as the case may be) may be counted as weeks of full-time employment only if the employee's contract or agreement of employment covers the off-season period and the off-season period is less than 6 months. Thus, a school teacher whose employment contract covers a 12-month period and who teaches on a full-time basis for more than 6 months in fulfillment of such contract is considered a full-time employee during the entire 12-month period. A taxpayer will not be deemed as other than a full-time employee during any week merely because of periods of involuntary temporary absence from work, such as those due to illness, strikes, shutouts, layoffs, natural disasters, etc.
(iv) In the case of taxpayers filing a joint return, either spouse may satisfy this 39-week requirement. However, weeks worked by one spouse may not be added to weeks worked by the other spouse in order to satisfy such requirement.
(v) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is an electrician residing in New York City. Having heard of the possibility of better employment prospects in Denver, Colorado, he moves himself, his family and his household goods and personal effects, at his own expense, to Denver where he secures employment with the M Aircraft Corporation. After working full-time for 30 weeks his job is terminated, and he subsequently moves to and secures employment in Los Angeles, California, which employment lasts for more than 39 weeks. Since A was not employed in the general location of his new principal place of employment while in Denver for at least 39 weeks, no deduction is allowable for moving expenses paid or incurred between New York City and Denver. A will be allowed to deduct only those moving expenses attributable to his move from Denver to Los Angeles, assuming all other conditions of section 217 are met.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that B, A's wife, secures employment in Denver at the same time as A, and that she continues to work in Denver for at least 9 weeks after A's departure for Los Angeles. Since she has met the 39-week requirement in Denver, and assuming all other requirements of section 217 are met, the moving expenses paid by A attributable to the move from New York City to Denver will be allowed as a deduction, provided A and B filed a joint return.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that B, A's wife, secures employment in Denver on the same day that A departs for Los Angeles, and continues to work in Denver for 9 weeks thereafter. Since neither A (who has worked 30 weeks) nor B (who has worked 9 weeks) has independently satisfied the 39-week requirement, no deduction for moving expenses attributable to the move from New York City to Denver is allowable.
(d)
Rules for application of section 217(c)(2)
—(1)
Inapplicability of 39-week test to reimbursed expenses.
(i) Paragraph (1) of section 217(d) provides that the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) does not apply to any moving expense item to the extent that the taxpayer receives reimbursement or other allowance from his employer for such item. A reimbursement or other allowance to an employee for expenses of moving, in the absence of a specific allocation by the employer, is allocated first to items deductible under section 217(a) and then, if a balance remains, to items not so deductible.
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a recent college graduate, with his residence in Washington, DC, is hired by the M Corporation in San Francisco, California. Under the terms of the employment contract, M agrees to reimburse A for three-fifths of his moving expenses from Washington to San Francisco. A moves to San Francisco, and pays $1,000 for expenses incurred, for which he is reimbursed $600 by M. After working for M for a period of 3 months, A becomes dissatisfied with the job and returns to Washington to continue his education. Since he has failed to satisfy the 39-week requirement of section 217(c)(2) the expenses totaling $400 for which A has received no reimbursement are not deductible.
Under the special rule of section 217(d)(1), however, the deduction for the $600 reimbursed moving expenses is not disallowed by reason of section 217(c)(2).

# Example 2.
B, a self-employed accountant, who works and resides in Columbus, Ohio, is hired by the N Company in St. Petersburg, Florida. Pursuant to its policy with respect to newly hired employees, N agrees to reimburse B to the extent of $1,000 of the expenses incurred by him in connection with his move to St. Petersburg, allocating $700 for the items specified in section 217(b)(1), and $300 for “temporary living expenses.” B moves to St. Petersburg, and incurs $800 of “moving expenses” and $300 of “temporary living expenses” in St. Petersburg. B receives reimbursement of $1,000 from N, which amount is included in his gross income. Assuming B fails to satisfy the 39-week test of section 217(c)(2), he will nevertheless be allowed to deduct $700 as a moving expense. On the other hand, had N made no allocation between deductible and non-deductible items, B would have been allowed to deduct $800 since, in the absence of a specific allocation of the reimbursement by N, it is presumed that the reimbursement was for items specified in section 217(b)(1) to the extent thereof.
(2)
Election of deduction before 39-week test is satisfied.
(i) Paragraph (2) of section 217(d) provides a special rule which applies in those cases where a taxpayer paid or incurred, in a particular taxable year, moving expenses which would be deductible in that taxable year except for the fact that the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) has not been satisfied before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. The rule provides that where a taxpayer has paid or incurred moving expenses and as of the date prescribed by section 6072 for filing his return for such taxable year, including extensions thereof as may be allowed under section 6081, there remains unexpired a sufficient portion of the 12-month period so that it is still possible for the taxpayer to satisfy the 39-week requirement, then the taxpayer may elect to claim a deduction for such moving expenses on the return for such taxable year. The election shall be exercised by taking the deduction on the return filed within the time prescribed by section 6072 (including extensions as may be allowed under section 6081). It is not necessary that the taxpayer wait until the date prescribed by law for filing his return in order to make the election. He may make the election on an early return based upon the facts known on the date such return is filed. However, an election made on an early return will become invalid if, as of the date prescribed by law for filing the return, it is not possible for the taxpayer to satisfy the 39-week requirement.
(ii) In the event that a taxpayer does not elect to claim a deduction for moving expenses on the return for the taxable year in which such expenses were paid or incurred in accordance with (i) of this subparagraph, and the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) (as well as all other requirements of section 217) is subsequently satisfied, then the taxpayer may file an amended return for the taxable year in which such moving expenses were paid or incurred on which he may claim a deduction under section 217. The taxpayer may, in lieu of filing an amended return, file a claim for refund based upon the deduction allowable under section 217.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is transferred by his employer, M, from Boston, Massachusetts, to Cleveland, Ohio, and begins working there on November 1, 1964, followed by his family and household goods and personal effects on November 15, 1964. Moving expenses are paid or incurred by A in 1964 in connection with this move. On April 15, 1965, when A files his income tax return for the year 1964, A has been a full-time employee in Cleveland for approximately 24 weeks. Notwithstanding the fact that as of April 15, 1965, A has not satisfied the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) he may nevertheless elect to claim his 1964 moving expenses on his 1964 income tax return since there is still sufficient time remaining before November 1, 1965, within which to satisfy the 39-week requirement.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that as of April 15, 1965, A has left the employ of M, and is in the process of seeking further employment in Cleveland. Since, under these conditions, A may be unsure whether or not he will be able to satisfy the 39-week requirement by November 1, 1965, he may not wish to avail himself of the election provided by section 217(d)(2). In such event, A may wait until he has actually satisfied the 39-week requirement, at which time he may file an amended return claiming as a deduction the moving
expenses paid or incurred in 1964. A may, in lieu of filing an amended return, file a claim for refund based upon a deduction for such expenses. Should A fail to satisfy the 39-week requirement on or before November 1, 1965, no deduction is allowable for moving expenses incurred in 1964.
(3)
Recapture of deduction where 39-week test is not met.
Paragraph (3) of section 217(d) provides a special rule which applies in cases where a taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) prior to his satisfying the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2), and the 39-week test is not satisfied during the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the expenses were deducted. In such cases an amount equal to the expenses which were deducted must be included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the expenses were deducted. In the event the taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) for the taxable year, and subsequently files an amended return for such year on which he eliminates such deduction, such expenses will not be deemed to have been deducted for purposes of the recapture rule of the preceding sentence.
(e)
Disallowance of deduction with respect to reimbursements not included in gross income.
Section 217(e) provides that no deduction shall be allowed under section 217 for any item to the extent that the taxpayer receives reimbursement or other expense allowance for such item unless the amount of such reimbursement or other expense allowance is included in his gross income. A reimbursement or other allowance to an employee for expenses of moving, in the absence of a specific allocation by the employer, is allocated first to items deductible under section 217(a) and then, if a balance remains, to items not so deductible. For purposes of this section, moving services furnished in-kind, directly or indirectly, by a taxpayer's employer to the taxpayer or members of his household are considered as being a reimbursement or other allowance received by the taxpayer for moving expenses. If a taxpayer pays or incurs moving expenses and either prior or subsequent thereto receives reimbursement or other expense allowance for such item, no deduction is allowed for such moving expenses unless the amount of the reimbursement or other expense allowance is included in his gross income in the year in which such reimbursement or other expense allowance is received. In those cases where the reimbursement or other expense allowance is received by a taxpayer for an item of moving expense subsequent to his having claimed a deduction for such item, and such reimbursement or other expense allowance is properly excluded from gross income in the year in which received, the taxpayer must file an amended return for the taxable year in which the moving expenses were deducted and decrease such deduction by the amount of the reimbursement or other expense allowance not included in gross income. This does not mean, however, that a taxpayer has an option to include or not include in his gross income an amount received as reimbursement or other expense allowance in connection with his move as an employee. This question remains one which must be resolved under section 61(a) (relating to the definition of gross income).
[T.D. 6796, 30 FR 1038, Feb. 2, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7195, 37 FR 13535, July 11, 1972]
§ 1.217-2
Deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
(a)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(a) allows a deduction from gross income for moving expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with his commencement of work as an employee or as a self-employed individual at a new principal place of work. For purposes of this section, amounts are considered as being paid or incurred by an individual whether goods or services are furnished to the taxpayer directly (by an employer, a client, a customer, or similar person) or indirectly (paid to a third party on behalf of the taxpayer by an employer, a client, a customer, or similar person). A cash basis taxpayer will treat moving expenses as being paid for purposes of section 217 and this section in the year in which
the taxpayer is considered to have received such payment under section 82 and § 1.82-1. No deduction is allowable under section 162 for any expenses incurred by the taxpayer in connection with moving from one residence to another residence unless such expenses are deductible under section 162 without regard to such change in residence. To qualify for the deduction under section 217 the expenses must meet the definition of the term
moving expenses
provided in section 217(b) and the taxpayer must meet the conditions set forth in section 217(c). The term
employee
as used in this section has the same meaning as in § 31.3401(c)-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations). The term
self-employed individual
as used in this section is defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(2)
Expenses paid in a taxable year other than the taxable year in which reimbursement representing such expenses is received.
In general, moving expenses are deductible in the year paid or incurred. If a taxpayer who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting receives reimbursement for a moving expense in a taxable year other than the taxable year the taxpayer pays such expense, he may elect to deduct such expense in the taxable year that he receives such reimbursement, rather than the taxable year when he paid such expense in any case where:
(i) The expense is paid in a taxable year prior to the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received, or
(ii) The expense is paid in the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received, provided that such expense is paid on or before the due date prescribed for filing the return (determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing) for the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received.
An election to deduct moving expenses in the taxable year that the reimbursement is received shall be made by claiming the deduction on the return, amended return, or claim for refund for the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received.
(3)
Commencement of work.
(i) To be deductible the moving expenses must be paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with his commencement of work at a new principal place of work (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for a discussion of the term
principal place of work
). Except for those expenses described in section 217(b)(1) (C) and (D) it is not necessary for the taxpayer to have made arrangements to work prior to his moving to a new location; however, a deduction is not allowable unless employment or self-employment actually does occur. The term
commencement
includes (
a
) the beginning of work by a taxpayer as an employee or as a self-employed individual for the first time or after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment, (
b
) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for a different employer or in the case of a self-employed individual in a new trade or business, or (
c
) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for the same employer or in the case of a self-employed individual in the same trade or business at a new location. To qualify as being in connection with the commencement of work, the move must bear a reasonable proximity both in time and place to such commencement at the new principal place of work. In general, moving expenses incurred within 1 year of the date of the commencement of work are considered to be reasonably proximate in time to such commencement. Moving expenses incurred after the 1-year period may be considered reasonably proximate in time if it can be shown that circumstances existed which prevented the taxpayer from incurring the expenses of moving within the 1-year period allowed. Whether circumstances existed which prevented the taxpayer from incurring the expenses of moving within the period allowed is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The length of the delay and the fact that the taxpayer may have incurred part of the expenses of the move within the 1-year period allowed shall be taken into account in determining whether expenses incurred after such period are allowable. In general, a move is not considered to be reasonably proximate in place to the commencement of work at the new
princpal place of work where the distance between the taxpayer's new residence and his new principal place of work exceeds the distance between his former residence and his new principal place of work. A move to a new residence which does not satisfy this test may, however, be considered reasonably proximate in place to the commencement of work if the taxpayer can demonstrate, for example, that he is required to live at such residence as a condition of employment or that living at such residence will result in an actual decrease in commuting time or expense. For example, assume that in 1977 A is transferred by his employer to a new principal place of work and the distance between his former residence and his new principal place of work is 35 miles greater than was the distance between his former residence and his former principal place of work. However, the distance between his new residence and his new principal place of work is 10 miles greater than was the distance between his former residence and his new principal place of work. Although the minimum distance requirement of section 217(c)(1) is met the expenses of moving to the new residence are not considered as incurred in connection with A's commencement of work at his new principal place of work since the new residence is not proximate in place to the new place of work. If, however, A can demonstrate, for example, that he is required to live at such new residence as a condition of employment or if living at such new residence will result in an actual decrease in commuting time or expense, the expenses of the move may be considered as incurred in connection with A's commencement of work at his new principal place of work.
(ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that A is tranferred by his employer from Boston, MA, to Washington, DC. A moves to a new residence in Washington, DC, and commences work on February 1, 1971. A's wife and his two children remain in Boston until June 1972 in order to allow A's children to complete their grade school education in Boston. On June 1, 1972, A sells his home in Boston and his wife and children move to the new residence in Washington, DC. The expenses incurred on June 1, 1972, in selling the old residence and in moving A's family, their household goods, and personal effects to the new residence in Washington are allowable as a deduction although they were incurred 16 months after the date of the commencement of work by A since A has moved to and established a new residence in Washington, DC, and thus incurred part of the total expenses of the move prior to the expiration of the 1-year period.

# Example 2.
Assume that A is transferred by his employer from Washington, DC, to Baltimore, MD. A commences work on January 1, 1971, in Baltimore. A commutes from his residence in Washington to his new principal place of work in Baltimore for a period of 18 months. On July 1, 1972, A decides to move to and establish a new residence in Baltimore. None of the moving expenses otherwise allowable under section 217 may be deducted since A neither incurred the expenses within 1 year nor has shown circumstances under which he was prevented from moving within such period.
(b)
Definition of moving expenses
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(b) defines the term
moving expenses
to mean only the reasonable expenses (i) of moving household goods and personal effects from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence, (ii) of traveling (including meals and lodging) from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence, (iii) of traveling (including meals and lodging), after obtaining employment, from the taxpayer's former residence to the general location of his new principal place of work and return, for the principal purpose of searching for a new residence, (iv) of meals and lodging while occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the new principal place of work during any period of 30 consecutive days after obtaining employment, or (v) of a nature constituting qualified residence sale, purchase, or lease expenses. Thus, the test of deductibility is whether the expenses are reasonable and are incurred for the items set forth in subdivisions (i) through (v) of this subparagraph.
(2)
Reasonable expenses.
(i) The term
moving expenses
includes only those expenses which are reasonable under the circumstances of the particular move. Expenses paid or incurred in excess of a reasonable amount are not deductible. Generally, expenses paid or incurred for movement of household goods and personal effects or for travel (including
meals and lodging) are reasonable only to the extent that they are paid or incurred for such movement or travel by the shortest and most direct route available from the former residence to the new residence by the conventional mode or modes of transportation actually used and in the shortest period of time commonly required to travel the distance involved by such mode. Thus, if moving or travel arrangements are made to provide a circuitous route for scenic, stopover, or other similar reasons, additional expenses resulting therefrom are not deductible since they are not reasonable nor related to the commencement of work at the new principal place of work. In addition, expenses paid or incurred for meals and lodging while traveling from the former residence to the new place of residence or to the general location of the new principal place of work and return or occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the new principal place of work are reasonable only if under the facts and circumstances involved such expenses are not lavish or extravagant.
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, an employee of the M Company works and maintains his residence in Boston, MA. Upon receiving orders from his employer that he is to be transferred to M's Los Angeles, CA, office, A motors to Los Angeles with his family with stopovers at various cities between Boston and Los Angeles to visit friends and relatives. In addition, A detours into Mexico for sightseeing. Because of the stopovers and tour into Mexico, A's travel time and distance are increased over what they would have been had he proceeded directly to Los Angeles. To the extent that A's route of travel between Boston and Los Angeles is in a generally southwesterly direction it may be said that he is traveling by the shortest and most direct route available by motor vehicle. Since A's excursion into Mexico is away from the usual Boston-Los Angeles route, the portion of the expenses paid or incurred attributable to such excursion is not deductible. Likewise, that portion of the expenses attributable to A's delay en route in visiting personal friends and sightseeing are not deductible.
(3)
Expense of moving household goods and personal effects.
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects include expenses of transporting such goods and effects from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence, and expenses of packing, crating, and in-transit storage and insurance for such goods and effects. Such expenses also include any costs of connecting or disconnecting utilities required because of the moving of household goods, appliances, or personal effects. Expenses of storing and insuring household goods and personal effects constitute in-transit expenses if incurred within any consecutive 30-day period after the day such goods and effects are moved from the taxpayer's former residence and prior to delivery at the taxpayer's new residence. Expenses paid or incurred in moving household goods and personal effects to the taxpayer's new residence from a place other than his former residence are allowable, but only to the extent that such expenses do not exceed the amount which would be allowable had such goods and effects been moved from the taxpayer's former residence. Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects do not include, for example, storage charges (other than in-transit), costs incurred in the acquisition of property, costs incurred and losses sustained in the disposition of property, penalties for breaking leases, mortgage penalties, expenses of refitting rugs or draperies, losses sustained on the disposal of memberships in clubs, tuition fees, and similar items. The above expenses may, however, be described in other provisions of section 217(b) and if so a deduction may be allowed for them subject to the allowable dollar limitations.
(4)
Expenses of traveling from the former residence to the new place of residence.
Expenses of traveling from the former residence to the new place of residence include the cost of transportation and of meals and lodging en route (including the date of arrival) from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence. Expenses of meals and lodging incurred in the general location of the former residence within 1 day after the former residence is no longer suitable for occupancy because of the removal of household goods and personal effects shall be considered as expenses of traveling for purposes of this subparagraph. The
date of arrival is the day the taxpayer secures lodging at the new place of residence, even if on a temporary basis. Expenses of traveling from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence do not include, for example, living or other expenses following the date of arrival at the new place of residence and while waiting to enter the new residence or waiting for household goods to arrive, expenses in connection with house or apartment hunting, living expenses preceding date of departure for the new place of residence (other than expenses of meals and lodging incurred within 1 day after the former residence is no longer suitable for occupancy), expenses of trips for purposes of selling property, expenses of trips to the former residence by the taxpayer pending the move by his family to the new place of residence, or any allowance for depreciation. The above expenses may, however, be described in other provisions of section 217(b) and if so a deduction may be allowed for them subject to the allowable dollar limitations. The deduction for traveling expenses from the former residence to the new place of residence is allowable for only one trip made by the taxpayer and members of his household; however, it is not necessary that the taxpayer and all members of his household travel together or at the same time.
(5)
Expenses of traveling for the principal purpose of looking for a new residence.
Expenses of traveling, after obtaining employment, from the former residence to the general location of the new principal place of work and return, for the principal purpose of searching for a new residence include the cost of transportation and meals and lodging during such travel and while at the general location of the new place of work for the principal purpose of searching for a new residence. However, such expenses do not include, for example, expenses of meals and lodging of the taxpayer and members of his household before departing for the new principal place of work, expenses for trips for purposes of selling property, expenses of trips to the former residence by the taxpayer pending the move by his family to the place of residence, or any allowance for depreciation. The above expenses may, however, be described in other provisions of section 217(b) and if so a deduction may be allowed for them. The deduction for expenses of traveling for the principal purpose of looking for a new residence is not limited to any number of trips by the taxpayer and by members of his household. In addition, the taxpayer and all members of his household need not travel together or at the same time. Moreover, a trip need not result in acquisition of a lease of property or purchase of property. An employee is considered to have obtained employment in the general location of the new principal place of work after he has obtained a contract or agreement of employment. A self-employed individual is considered to have obtained employment when he has made substantial arrangements to commence work at the new principal place of work (see paragraph (f)(2) of this section for a discussion of the term
made substantial arrangements to commence to work
).
(6)
Expenses of occupying temporary quarters.
Expenses of occupying temporary quarters include only the cost of meals and lodging while occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the new principal place of work during any period of 30 consecutive days after the taxpayer has obtained employment in such general location. Thus, expenses of occupying temporary quarters do not include, for example, the cost of entertainment, laundry, transportation, or other personal, living family expenses, or expenses of occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the former place of work. The 30 consecutive day period is any one period of 30 consecutive days which can begin, at the option of the taxpayer, on any day after the day the taxpayer obtains employment in the general location of the new principal place of work.
(7)
Qualified residence sale, purchase, or lease expenses.
Qualified residence sale, purchase, or lease expenses (hereinafter “qualified real estate expenses”) are only reasonable amounts paid or incurred for any of the following purposes:
(i) Expenses incident to the sale or exchange by the taxpayer or his spouse of the taxpayer's former residence
which, but for section 217 (b) and (e), would be taken into account in determining the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the residence. These expenses include real estate commissions, attorneys' fees, title fees, escrow fees, so called “points” or loan placement charges which the seller is required to pay, State transfer taxes and similar expenses paid or incurred in connection with the sale or exchange. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and this section for the cost of physical improvements intended to enhance salability by improving the condition or appearance of the residence.
(ii) Expenses incident to the purchase by the taxpayer or his spouse of a new residence in the general location of the new principal place of work which, but for section 217 (b) and (e), would be taken into account in determining either the adjusted basis of the new residence or the cost of a loan. These expenses include attorney's fees, escrow fees, appraisal fees, title costs, so-called “points” or loan placement charges not representing payments or prepayments of interest, and similar expenses paid or incurred in connection with the purchase of the new residence. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and this section for any portion of real estate taxes or insurance, so-called “points” or loan placement charges which are, in essence, prepayments of interest, or the purchase price of the residence.
(iii) Expenses incident to the settlement of an unexpired lease held by the taxpayer or his spouse on property used by the taxpayer as his former residence. These expenses include consideration paid to a lessor to obtain a release from a lease, attorneys' fees, real estate commissions, or similar expenses incident to obtaining a release from a lease or to obtaining an assignee or a sublessee such as the difference between rent paid under a primary lease and rent received under a sublease. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and this section for the cost of physical improvement intended to enhance marketability of the leasehold by improving the condition or appearance of the residence.
(iv) Expenses incident to the acquisition of a lease by the taxpayer or his spouse. These expenses include the cost of fees or commissions for obtaining a lease, a sublease, or an assignment of an interest in property used by the taxpayer as his new residence in the general location of the new principal place of work. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and this section for payments or prepayments of rent or payments representing the cost of a security or other similar deposit.
Qualified real estate expenses do not include losses sustained on the disposition of property or mortgage penalties, to the extent that such penalties are otherwise deductible as interest.
(8)
Residence.
The term
former residence
refers to the taxpayer's principal residence before his departure for his new principal place of work. The term
new residence
refers to the taxpayer's principal residence within the general location of his new principal place of work. Thus, neither term includes other residences owned or maintained by the taxpayer or members of his family or seasonal residences such as a summer beach cottage. Whether or not property is used by the taxpayer as his principal residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances in each case. Property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence may include a houseboat, a housetrailer, or similar dwelling. The term
new place of residence
generally includes the area within which the taxpayer might reasonably be expected to commute to his new principal place of work.
(9)
Dollar limitations.
(i) Expenses described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 217(b)(1) are not subject to an overall dollar limitation. Thus, assuming all other requirements of section 217 are satisfied, a taxpayer who, in connection with his commencement of work at a new principal place of work, pays or incurs reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from his former residence to his new place of residence and reasonable expenses of traveling, including meals and lodging, from his former residence to his new place of residence is permitted to deduct the entire amount of these expenses.
(ii) Expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) are subject to an overall dollar limitation for each commencement of work of 3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977), of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) cannot exceed $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977). The dollar limitation applies to the amount of expenses paid or incurred in connection with each commencement of work and not to the amount of expenses paid or incurred in each taxable year. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who paid or incurred $2,000 of expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) in taxable year 1977 in connection with his commencement of work at a principal place of work and paid or incurred an additional $2,000 of such expenses in taxable year 1978 in connection with the same commencement of work is permitted to deduct the $2,000 of such expenses paid or incurred in taxable year 1977 and only $1,000 of such expenses paid or incurred in taxable year 1978.
(iii) A taxpayer who pays or incurs expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) in connection with the same commencement of work may choose to deduct any combination of such expenses within the dollar amounts specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, a taxpayer who pays or incurs such expenses in connection with the same commencement of work may either choose to deduct: (
a
) Expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) to the extent of $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) before deducting any of the expenses described in subparagraph (E) of such section, or (
b
) expenses described in subparagraph (E) of section 217(b)(1) to the extent of $3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) before deducting any of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of such section.
(iv) For the purpose of computing the dollar limitation contained in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(3) a commencement of work by a taxpayer at a new principal place of work and a commencement of work by his spouse at a new principal place of work which are in the same general location constitute a single commencement of work. Two principal places of work are treated as being in the same general location where the taxpayer and his spouse reside together and commute to their principal places of work. Two principal places of work are not treated as being in the same general location where, as of the close of the taxable year, the taxpayer and his spouse have not shared the same new residence nor made specific plans to share the same new residence within a determinable time. Under such circumstances, the separate commencements of work by a taxpayer and his spouse will be considered separately in assigning the dollar limitations and expenses to the appropriate return in the manner described in subdivisions (v) and (vi) of this subparagraph.
(v) Moving expenses (described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1)), paid or incurred with respect to the commencement of work by both a husband and wife which is considered a single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph are subject to an overall dollar limitation of $3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977), per move of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) cannot exceed $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977). If separate returns are filed with respect to the commencement of work by both a husband and wife which is considered a single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, moving expenses (described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1)) are subject to an overall dollar limitation of $1,500 ($1,250 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977), per move of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section
217(b)(1) cannot exceed $750 ($500 in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) with respect to each return. Where moving expenses are paid or incurred in more than 1 taxable year with respect to a single commencement of work by a husband and wife they shall, for purposes of applying the dollar limitations to such move, be subject to a $3,000 and $1,500 limitation ($2,500 and $1,000, respectively, in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) for all such years that they file a joint return and shall be subject to a separate $1,500 and $750 limitation ($1,250 and $500, respectively, in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) for all such years that they file separate returns. If a joint return is filed for the first taxable year moving expenses are paid or incurred with respect to a move but separate returns are filed in a subsequent year, the unused portion of the amount which may be deducted shall be allocated equally between the husband and wife in the later year. If separate returns are filed for the first taxable year such moving expenses are paid or incurred but a joint return is filed in a subsequent year, the deductions claimed on their separate returns shall be aggregated for purposes of determining the unused portion of the amount which may be deducted in the later year.
(vi) The application of subdivisions (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, who was transferred by his employer, effective January 15, 1977, moved from Boston, MA, to Washington, DC. A's wife was transferred by her employer, effective January 15, 1977, from Boston, MA, to Baltimore, MD. A and his wife reside together at the same new residence. A and his wife are cash basis taxpayers and file a joint return for taxable year 1977. Because A and his wife reside together at the new residence, the commencement of work by both is considered a single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph. They are permitted to deduct with respect to their commencement of work in Washington and Baltimore up to $3,000 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of such section cannot exceed $1,500.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that for taxable year 1977, A and his wife file separate returns. Because A and his wife reside together, the commencement of work by both is considered a single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph. A is permitted to deduct with respect to his commencement of work in Washington up to $1,500 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $750. A is not permitted to deduct any of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid by his wife in connection with her commencement of work at a new principal place of work. A's wife is permitted to deduct with respect to her commencement of work in Baltimore up to $1,500 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) that are paid by her of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $750. A's wife is not permitted to deduct any of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid by A in connection with his commencement of work in Washington, DC.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that A and his wife take up separate residences in Washington and Baltimore, do not reside together during the entire taxable year, and have no specific plans to reside together. The commencement of work by A in Washington, DC, and by his wife in Baltimore are considered separate commencements of work since their principal places of work are not treated as being in the same general location. If A and his wife file a joint return for taxable year 1977, the moving expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid in connection with the commencement of work by A in Washington, DC, and his wife in Baltimore, MD, are subject to an overall limitation of $6,000 of which the expenses described in subparagrahs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $3,000. If A and his wife file separate returns for taxable year 1977, A may deduct up to $3,000 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $1,500. A's wife may deduct up to $3,000 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $1,500.
(10)
Individuals other than taxpayer.
(i) In addition to the expenses set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 217(b)(1) attributable to the taxpayer alone, the same type of expenses
attributable to certain individuals other than the taxpayer, if paid or incurred by the taxpayer, are deductible. These other individuals must be members of the taxpayer's household, and have both the taxpayer's former residence and his new residence as their principal place of abode. A member of the taxpayer's household includes any individual residing at the taxpayer's residence who is neither a tenant nor an employee of the taxpayer. Thus, for example, a member of the taxpayer's household may not be an individual such as a servant, governess, chauffeur, nurse, valet, or personal attendant. However, for purposes of this paragraph, a tenant or employee will be considered a member of the taxpayer's household where the tenant or employee is a dependent of the taxpayer as defined in section 152.
