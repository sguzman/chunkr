(i) Ongoing administrative fee;
(ii) Costs to help families who experience difficulty finding or renting appropriate housing under the program;
(iii) The following types of extraordinary costs approved by HUD:
(A) Costs to cover necessary additional expenses incurred by the PHA to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title (e.g., additional counselling costs), where the PHA is unable to cover such additional expenses from ongoing administrative fee income or the PHA administrative fee reserve;
(B) Costs of audit by an independent public accountant;
(C) Other extraordinary costs determined necessary by HUD Headquarters;
(iv) Preliminary fee (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section);
(v) Costs to coordinate supportive services for families participating in the family self-sufficiency (FSS) program.
(2) For each PHA fiscal year, administrative fees are specified in the PHA budget. The budget is submitted for HUD approval. Fees are paid in the amounts approved by HUD. Administrative fees may only be approved or paid from amounts appropriated by the Congress.
(3) PHA administrative fees may only be used to cover costs incurred to perform PHA administrative responsibilities for the program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.
(b)
Ongoing administrative fee.
(1) The PHA ongoing administrative fee is paid for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month. The amount of the ongoing fee is determined by HUD in accordance with Section 8(q)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)(1)).
(2) If appropriations are available, HUD may pay a higher ongoing administrative fee for a small program or a program operating over a large geographic area. This higher fee level will not be approved unless the PHA demonstrates that it is efficiently administering its HCV program, and that the higher ongoing administrative fee is reasonable and necessary for administration of the program in accordance with HUD requirements.
(3) HUD may pay a lower ongoing administrative fee for PHA-owned units.
(c)
Preliminary fee.
(1) If the PHA was not administering a program of Section 8 tenant-based assistance prior to the merger date, HUD will pay a one-time fee in the amount of $500 in the first year the PHA administers a program. The fee is paid for each new unit added to the PHA program by the initial funding increment under the consolidated ACC.
(2) The preliminary fee is used to cover expenses the PHA incurs to help families who inquire about or apply for the program, and to lease up new program units.
(d)
Reducing PHA administrative fee.
HUD may reduce or offset any administrative fee to the PHA, in the amount determined by HUD, if the PHA fails to perform PHA administrative responsibilities correctly or adequately under the program (for example, PHA failure to enforce HQS requirements; or to reimburse a receiving PHA promptly under portability procedures).

However, HUD may prohibit use of the funds for certain purposes.
(2) The PHA Board of Commissioners or other authorized officials must establish the maximum amount that may be charged against the administrative fee reserve without specific approval.

# Subpart E—Admission to Tenant-Based Program
§ 982.201
Eligibility and targeting.
(a)
When applicant is eligible: General.
The PHA may admit only eligible families to the program. To be eligible, an applicant must be a “family;” must be income-eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and 24 CFR part 5, subpart F; and must be a citizen or a noncitizen who has eligible immigration status as determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E. If the applicant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies.
(b)
Income
—(1)
Income-eligibility.
To be income-eligible, the applicant must be a family in any of the following categories:
(i) A “very low income” family;
(ii) A low-income family that is “continuously assisted” under the 1937 Housing Act;
(iii) A low-income family that meets additional eligibility criteria specified in the PHA Administrative Plan. Such additional PHA criteria must be consistent with the PHA plan and with the consolidated plans for local governments in the PHA jurisdiction;
(iv) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a HOPE 1 (HOPE for public housing homeownership) or HOPE 2 (HOPE for homeownership of multifamily units) project. (Section 8(o)(4)(D) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(4)(D));
(v) A low-income or moderate-income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of an insurance contract on eligible low-income housing as defined in § 248.101 of this title;
(vi) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a project subject to a resident homeownership program under § 248.173 of this title.
(2)
Income-targeting.
(i) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's HCV program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low income families. Annual income of such families shall be verified within the period described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) A PHA may admit a lower percent of extremely low income families during a PHA fiscal year (than otherwise required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) if HUD approves the use of such lower percent by the PHA, in accordance with the PHA plan, based on HUD's determination that the following circumstances necessitate use of such lower percent by the PHA:
(A) The PHA has opened its waiting list for a reasonable time for admission of extremely low income families residing in the same metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or non-metropolitan county, both inside and outside the PHA jurisdiction;
(B) The PHA has provided full public notice of such opening to such families, and has conducted outreach and marketing to such families, including outreach and marketing to extremely low income families on the Section 8 and public housing waiting lists of other PHAs with jurisdiction in the same MSA or non-metropolitan county;
(C) Notwithstanding such actions by the PHA (in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section), there are not enough extremely low income families on the PHA's waiting list to fill available slots in the program during any fiscal year for which use of a lower percent is approved by HUD; and
(D) Admission of the additional very low income families other than extremely low income families to the PHA's tenant-based voucher program will substantially address worst case housing needs as determined by HUD.
(iii) If approved by HUD, the admission of a portion of very low income welfare-to-work (WTW) families that are not extremely low income families may be disregarded in determining compliance with the PHA's income-targeting obligations under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. HUD will grant such approval only if and to the extent that the PHA has demonstrated to HUD's satisfaction that compliance with such targeting obligations with respect to such portion of WTW families would interfere with the objectives
of the welfare-to-work voucher program. If HUD grants such approval, admission of that portion of WTW families is not counted in the base number of families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based voucher program during the fiscal year for purposes of income targeting.
(iv) Admission of families as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(v) of this section is not subject to targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(v) If the jurisdictions of two or more PHAs that administer the HCV program cover an identical geographic area, such PHAs may elect to be treated as a single PHA for purposes of targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such a case, the PHAs shall cooperate to assure that aggregate admissions by such PHAs comply with the targeting requirement. If such PHAs do not have a single fiscal year, HUD will determine which PHA's fiscal year is used for this purpose.
(vi) If a family initially leases a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures at admission to the HCV program, such admission shall be counted against the targeting obligation of the initial PHA (unless the receiving PHA absorbs the portable family into the receiving PHA's HCV program from the point of admission).
(3) The annual income (gross income) of an applicant family is used both for determination of income-eligibility under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In determining annual income of an applicant family that includes a person with disabilities, the determination must include the disallowance of increase in annual income as provided in 24 CFR 5.617, if applicable.
(4) The applicable income limit for issuance of a voucher when a family is selected for the program is the highest income limit (for the family size) for areas in the PHA jurisdiction. The applicable income limit for admission to the program is the income limit for the area where the family is initially assisted in the program. At admission, the family may only use the voucher to rent a unit in an area where the family is income eligible.
(c)
Family composition.
See definition of “family” in 24 CFR 5.403.
(d)
Continuously assisted.
(1) An applicant is continuously assisted under the 1937 Housing Act if the family is already receiving assistance under any 1937 Housing Act program when the family is admitted to the voucher program.
(2) The PHA must establish policies concerning whether and to what extent a brief interruption between assistance under one of these programs and admission to the voucher program will be considered to break continuity of assistance under the 1937 Housing Act.
(e)
When PHA verifies that applicant is eligible.
The PHA must receive information verifying that an applicant is eligible within the period of 60 days before the PHA issues a voucher to the applicant.
(f)
Decision to deny assistance
—(1)
Notice to applicant.
The PHA must give an applicant prompt written notice of a decision denying admission to the program (including a decision that the applicant is not eligible, or denying assistance for other reasons). The notice must give a brief statement of the reasons for the decision. The notice must also state that the applicant may request an informal review of the decision, and state how to arrange for the informal review.
(2) For description of the grounds for denying assistance because of action or inaction by the applicant, see § 982.552(b) and (c) (requirement and authority to deny admission) and § 982.553(a) (crime by family members).

(2)
Where family will live.
Admission to the program may not be based on where the family will live with assistance under the program.

(c)
Applicant status.
An applicant does not have any right or entitlement to be listed on the PHA waiting list, to any particular position on the waiting list, or to admission to the programs. The preceding sentence does not affect or prejudice any right, independent of this rule, to bring a judicial action challenging an PHA violation of a constitutional or statutory requirement.
(d)
Admission policy.
The PHA must admit applicants for participation in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements, including, but not limited to, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and with PHA policies stated in the PHA Administrative Plan and the PHA plan. The PHA admission policy must state the system of admission preferences that the PHA uses to select applicants from the waiting list, including any residency preference or other local preference.

§ 982.207
Waiting list: Local preferences in admission to program.
(a)
Establishment of PHA local preferences.
(1) The PHA may establish a system of local preferences for selection of families admitted to the program. PHA selection preferences must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.
(2) The PHA system of local preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities, as determined by the PHA. In determining such needs and priorities, the PHA shall use generally accepted data sources. The PHA shall consider public comment on the proposed public housing agency plan (as received pursuant to § 903.17 of this chapter) and on the consolidated plan for the relevant jurisdiction (as received pursuant to part 91 of this title).
(3) The PHA may limit the number of applicants that may qualify for any local preference.
(4) The PHA shall not deny a local preference, nor otherwise exclude or penalize a family in admission to the program, solely because the family resides in a public housing project. The PHA may establish a preference for families residing in public housing who are victims of a crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16).
(b)
Particular local preferences
—(1)
Residency requirements or preferences.
(i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although a PHA is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the PHA may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title.
(ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area
(“residency preference area”). A county or municipality may be used as a residency preference area. An area smaller than a county or municipality may not be used as a residency preference area.
(iii) Any PHA residency preferences must be included in the statement of PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admission to the program, which is included in the PHA annual plan (or supporting documents) pursuant to part 903 of this title. Such policies must specify that use of a residency preference will not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to the program based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.
(iv) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.
(v) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The PHA may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.
(2)
Preference for working families.
The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families where the head, spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.
(3)
Preference for person with disabilities.
The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the PHA may not adopt a preference for admission of persons with a specific disability.
(4)
Preference for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
The PHA should consider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(5)
Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities.
The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.
(c)
Selection among families with preference.
The PHA system of preferences may use either of the following to select among applicants on the waiting list with the same preference status:
(1) Date and time of application; or
(2) A drawing or other random choice technique.
(d)
Preference for higher-income families.
The PHA must not select families for admission to the program in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting higher income families for admission to the program.
(e)
Verification of selection method.
The method for selecting applicants from a preference category must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that each applicant has been selected in accordance with the method specified in the Administrative Plan.

(ii) If there are any changes in lease provisions governing the term of the lease;
(iii) If the family moves to a new unit, even if the unit is in the same building or complex.
(3) PHA approval of the tenancy, and execution of a new HAP contract, are not required for changes in the lease other than as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(4) The owner must notify the PHA of any changes in the amount of the rent to owner at least sixty days before any such changes go into effect, and any such changes shall be subject to rent reasonableness requirements (see § 982.503).

§ 982.309
Term of assisted tenancy.
(a)
Initial term of lease.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the initial lease term must be for at least one year.
(2) The PHA may approve a shorter initial lease term if the PHA determines that:
(i) Such shorter term would improve housing opportunities for the tenant; and
(ii) Such shorter term is the prevailing local market practice.
(3) During the initial term of the lease, the owner may not raise the rent to owner.
(4) The PHA may execute the HAP contract even if there is less than one year remaining from the beginning of the initial lease term to the end of the last expiring funding increment under the consolidated ACC.
(b)
Term of HAP contract.
(1) The term of the HAP contract begins on the first day of the lease term and ends on the last day of the lease term.
(2) The HAP contract terminates if any of the following occurs:
(i) The lease is terminated by the owner or the tenant;
(ii) The PHA terminates the HAP contract; or
(iii) The PHA terminates assistance for the family.
(c)
Family responsibility.
(1) If the family terminates the lease on notice to the owner, the family must give the PHA a copy of the notice of termination at the same time. Failure to do this is a breach of family obligations under the program.
(2) The family must notify the PHA and the owner before the family moves out of the unit. Failure to do this is a breach of family obligations under the program.
[64 FR 26645, May 14, 1999]
§ 982.310
Owner termination of tenancy.
(a)
Grounds.
During the term of the lease, the owner may not terminate the tenancy except on the following grounds:
(1) Serious violation (including but not limited to failure to pay rent or other amounts due under the lease) or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease;
(2) Violation of federal, State, or local law that imposes obligations on the tenant in connection with the occupancy or use of the premises; or
(3) Other good cause.
(b)
Nonpayment by PHA: Not grounds for termination of tenancy.
(1) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the PHA.
(2) The PHA failure to pay the housing assistance payment to the owner is not a violation of the lease between the tenant and the owner. During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.
(c)
Criminal activity
—(1)
Evicting drug criminals due to drug crime on or near the premises.
The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in, on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, or such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the owner to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that the owner may evict a family when the owner determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the owner determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(2)
Evicting other criminals.
(i)
Threat to other residents.
The lease must provide that the owner may terminate tenancy for any of the following types of criminal activity by a covered person:
(A) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents (including property management staff residing on the premises);
(B) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or
(C) Any violent criminal activity on or near the premises by a tenant, household member, or guest, or any such activity on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control.
(ii)
Fugitive felon or parole violator.
The lease must provide that the owner may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is:
(A) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State
of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or
(B) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.
(3)
Evidence of criminal activity.
The owner may terminate tenancy and evict by judicial action a family for criminal activity by a covered person in accordance with this section if the owner determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction. (See part 5, subpart J, of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)
(d)
Other good cause.
(1) “Other good cause” for termination of tenancy by the owner may include, but is not limited to, any of the following examples:
(i) Failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision;
(ii) A family history of disturbance of neighbors or destruction of property, or of living or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the unit or premises;
(iii) The owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or
(iv) A business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental).
(2) During the initial lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause”, unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do. For example, during this period, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause” based on any of the following grounds: failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision; the owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section).
(e)
Owner notice
—(1)
Notice of grounds.
(i) The owner must give the tenant a written notice that specifies the grounds for termination of tenancy during the term of the lease. The tenancy does not terminate before the owner has given this notice, and the notice must be given at or before commencement of the eviction action.
(ii) The notice of grounds may be included in, or may be combined with, any owner eviction notice to the tenant.
(2)
Eviction notice.
(i) Owner eviction notice means a notice to vacate, or a complaint or other initial pleading used under State or local law to commence an eviction action.
(ii) The owner must give the PHA a copy of any owner eviction notice to the tenant.
(f)
Eviction by court action.
The owner may only evict the tenant from the unit by instituting a court action.
(g)
Regulations not applicable.
24 CFR part 247 (concerning evictions from certain subsidized and HUD-owned projects) does not apply to a tenancy assisted under this part 982.
(h)
Termination of tenancy decisions
—(1)
General.
If the law and regulation permit the owner to take an action but do not require action to be taken, the owner may take or not take the action in accordance with the owner's standards for eviction. The owner may consider all of the circumstances relevant to a particular eviction case, such as:
(i) The seriousness of the offending action;
(ii) The effect on the community of denial or termination or the failure of the owner to take such action;
(iii) The extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action;
(iv) The effect of denial of admission or termination of tenancy on household members not involved in the offending activity;
(v) The demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities;
(vi) The extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action;
(vii) The effect of the owner's action on the integrity of the program.
(2)
Exclusion of culpable household member.
The owner may require a tenant to exclude a household member in
order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.
(3)
Consideration of rehabilitation.
In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the owner may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the owner may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.
(4)
Nondiscrimination limitation and protection for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
The owner's termination of tenancy actions must be consistent with the fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of 24 CFR 5.105, and with the provisions for protection of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).

§ 982.311
When assistance is paid.
(a)
Payments under HAP contract.
Housing assistance payments are paid to the owner in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract. Housing assistance payments may only be paid to the owner during the lease term, and while the family is residing in the unit.
(b)
Termination of payment: When owner terminates the lease.
Housing assistance payments terminate when the lease is terminated by the owner in accordance with the lease. However, if the owner has commenced the process to evict the tenant, and if the family continues to reside in the unit, the PHA must continue to make housing assistance payments to the owner in accordance with the HAP contract until the owner has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant. The PHA may continue such payments until the family moves from or is evicted from the unit.
(c)
Termination of payment: Other reasons for termination.
Housing assistance payments terminate if:
(1) The lease terminates;
(2) The HAP contract terminates; or
(3) The PHA terminates assistance for the family.
(d)
Family move-out.
(1) If the family moves out of the unit, the PHA may not make any housing assistance payment to the owner for any month after the month when the family moves out. The owner may keep the housing assistance payment for the month when the family moves out of the unit.
(2) If a participant family moves from an assisted unit with continued tenant-based assistance, the term of the assisted lease for the new assisted unit may begin during the month the family moves out of the first assisted unit. Overlap of the last housing assistance payment (for the month when the family moves out of the old unit) and the first assistance payment for the new unit, is not considered to constitute a duplicative housing subsidy.
[60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015]
§ 982.312
Absence from unit.
(a) The family may be absent from the unit for brief periods. For longer absences, the PHA Administrative Plan establishes the PHA policy on how long the family may be absent from the assisted unit. However, the family may not be absent from the unit for a period of more than 180 consecutive calendar days in any circumstance, or for any reason. At its discretion, the PHA may allow absence for a lesser period in accordance with PHA policy.
(b) Housing assistance payments terminate if the family is absent for longer than the maximum period permitted. The term of the HAP contract and assisted lease also terminate.
(The owner must reimburse the PHA for any housing assistance payment for the period after the termination.)
(c) Absence means that no member of the family is residing in the unit.
(d)(1) The family must supply any information or certification requested by the PHA to verify that the family is residing in the unit, or relating to family absence from the unit. The family must cooperate with the PHA for this purpose. The family must promptly notify the PHA of absence from the unit, including any information requested on the purposes of family absences.
(2) The PHA may adopt appropriate techniques to verify family occupancy or absence, including letters to the family at the unit, phone calls, visits or questions to the landlord or neighbors.
(e) The PHA Administrative Plan must state the PHA policies on family absence from the dwelling unit. The PHA absence policy includes:
(1) How the PHA determines whether or when the family may be absent, and for how long. For example, the PHA may establish policies on absences because of vacation, hospitalization or imprisonment; and
(2) Any provision for resumption of assistance after an absence, including readmission or resumption of assistance to the family.
§ 982.313
Security deposit: Amounts owed by tenant.
(a) The owner may collect a security deposit from the tenant.
(b) The PHA may prohibit security deposits in excess of private market practice, or in excess of amounts charged by the owner to unassisted tenants.
(c) When the tenant moves out of the dwelling unit, the owner, subject to State or local law, may use the security deposit, including any interest on the deposit, in accordance with the lease, as reimbursement for any unpaid rent payable by the tenant, damages to the unit or for other amounts the tenant owes under the lease.
(d) The owner must give the tenant a written list of all items charged against the security deposit, and the amount of each item. After deducting the amount, if any, used to reimburse the owner, the owner must refund promptly the full amount of the unused balance to the tenant.
(e) If the security deposit is not sufficient to cover amounts the tenant owes under the lease, the owner may seek to collect the balance from the tenant.
§ 982.315
Family break-up.
(a)(1) The PHA has discretion to determine which members of an assisted family continue to receive assistance in the program if the family breaks up. The PHA Administrative Plan must state PHA policies on how to decide who remains in the program if the family breaks up.
(2) If the family break-up results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance.
(b) The factors to be considered in making this decision under the PHA policy may include:
(1) Whether the assistance should remain with family members remaining in the original assisted unit.
(2) The interest of minor children or of ill, elderly, or disabled family members.
(3) Whether family members are forced to leave the unit as a result of actual or threatened domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(4) Whether any of the family members are receiving protection as victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and whether the abuser is still in the household.
(5) Other factors specified by the PHA.
(c) If a court determines the disposition of property between members of the assisted family in a divorce or separation under a settlement or judicial decree, the PHA is bound by the court's
determination of which family members continue to receive assistance in the program.

§ 982.316
Live-in aide.
(a) A family that consists of one or more elderly, near-elderly or disabled persons may request that the PHA approve a live-in aide to reside in the unit and provide necessary supportive services for a family member who is a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 to make the program accessible to and usable by the family member with a disability. (See § 982.402(b)(6) concerning effect of live-in aide on family unit size.)
(b) At any time, the PHA may refuse to approve a particular person as a live-in aide, or may withdraw such approval, if:
(1) The person commits fraud, bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any federal housing program;
(2) The person commits drug-related criminal activity or violent criminal activity; or
(3) The person currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.

§ 982.317
Lease-purchase agreements.
(a) A family leasing a unit with assistance under the program may enter into an agreement with an owner to purchase the unit. So long as the family is receiving such rental assistance, all requirements applicable to families otherwise leasing units under the tenant-based program apply. Any homeownership premium (e.g., increment of value attributable to the value of the lease-purchase right or agreement such as an extra monthly payment to accumulate a downpayment or reduce the purchase price) included in the rent to the owner that would result in a higher subsidy amount than would otherwise be paid by the PHA must be absorbed by the family.
(b) In determining whether the rent to owner for a unit subject to a lease-purchase agreement is a reasonable amount in accordance with § 982.503, any homeownership premium paid by the family to the owner must be excluded when the PHA determines rent reasonableness.

§ 982.353
Where family can lease a unit with tenant-based assistance.
(a)
Assistance in the initial PHA jurisdiction.
The family may receive tenant-based assistance to lease a unit located anywhere in the jurisdiction (as determined by State and local law) of the initial PHA. HUD may nevertheless restrict the family's right to lease such a unit anywhere in such jurisdiction if HUD determines that limitations on a family's opportunity to select among available units in that jurisdiction are appropriate to achieve desegregation goals in accordance with obligations generated by a court order or consent decree.
(b)
Portability: Assistance outside the initial PHA jurisdiction.
Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, and to § 982.552
and § 982.553, a voucher-holder or participant family has the right to receive tenant-based voucher assistance, in accordance with requirements of this part, to lease a unit outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, anywhere in the United States, in the jurisdiction of a PHA with a tenant-based program under this part. The initial PHA must not provide such portable assistance for a participant if the family has moved out of the assisted unit in violation of the lease except as provided for in this subsection. If the family moves out in violation of the lease in order to protect the health or safety of a person who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believes him- or herself to be threatened with imminent harm from further violence by remaining in the dwelling unit (or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move), and has otherwise complied with all other obligations under the Section 8 program, the family may receive a voucher from the initial PHA and move to another jurisdiction under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
(c)
Nonresident applicants.
(1) This paragraph (c) applies if neither the household head nor spouse of an assisted family already had a “domicile” (legal residence) in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA at the time when the family first submitted an application for participation in the program to the initial PHA.
(2) The following apply during the 12 month period from the time when a family described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is admitted to the program:
(i) The family may lease a unit anywhere in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA;
(ii) The family does not have any right to portability;
(iii) The initial PHA may choose to allow portability during this period.
(3) If the initial PHA approves, the family may lease a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures.
(4) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member who has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.
(d)
Income eligibility.
(1) For admission to the program, a family must be income eligible in the area where the family initially leases a unit with assistance under the program.
(2) If a family is a participant in the initial PHA's voucher program, income eligibility is not redetermined when the family moves to the receiving PHA program under portability procedures.
(e)
Freedom of choice.
The PHA may not directly or indirectly reduce the family's opportunity to select among available units, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, or elsewhere in this part 982 (e.g., prohibition on the use of ineligible housing, housing not meeting HQS, or housing for which the rent to owner exceeds a reasonable rent). However, the PHA must provide families the information required in § 982.301 for both the oral briefing and the information packet to ensure that they have the information they need to make an informed decision on their housing choice.

§ 982.354
Move with continued tenant-based assistance.
(a)
Applicability.
This section states when a participant family may move to a new unit with continued tenant-based assistance:
(b)
When family may move.
A family may move to a new unit if:
(1) The assisted lease for the old unit has terminated. This includes a termination because:
(i) The PHA has terminated the HAP contract for the owner's breach; or
(ii) The lease has terminated by mutual agreement of the owner and the tenant.
(2) The owner has given the tenant a notice to vacate, or has commenced an action to evict the tenant, or has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant.
(3) The tenant has given notice of lease termination (if the tenant has a right to terminate the lease on notice to the owner, for owner breach, or otherwise).
(4) The family or a member of the family, is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or if any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move. A PHA may not terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, moves out of a unit in violation of the lease, if such move occurs to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit. However, any family member that has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move is not required to believe that he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit.
(c)
How many moves.
(1) A participant family may move with continued assistance under the program, either inside the PHA jurisdiction, or under the portability procedures (See § 982.353) in accordance with the PHA's policies.
(2) Consistent with applicable civil rights laws and regulations, the PHA may establish policies that:
(i) Prohibit any move by the family during the initial lease term;
(ii) Prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period; and
(iii) The above policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.
(d)
Notice that family wants to move.
If the family wants to move to a new unit, the family must notify the PHA and the owner before moving from the old unit. If the family wants to move to a new unit that is located outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the notice to the initial PHA must specify the area where the family wants to move. See portability procedures in subpart H of this part.
(e)
When the PHA may deny permission to move.
(1) The PHA may deny permission to move if the PHA does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance. The PHA must provide written notification to the local HUD Office within 10 business days of determining it is necessary to deny moves to a higher-cost unit based on insufficient funding.
(2) At any time, the PHA may deny permission to move in accordance with § 982.552 (grounds for denial or termination of assistance).

§ 982.355
Portability: Administration by initial and receiving PHA.
(a)
General.
When a family moves under portability (in accordance with § 982.353(b)) to an area outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the receiving PHA must administer assistance for
the family if a PHA with a HCV program has jurisdiction in the area where the unit is located.
(b)
Requirement to administer assistance.
A receiving PHA cannot refuse to assist incoming portable families or direct them to another neighboring PHA for assistance. If there is more than one such PHA, the initial PHA provides the family with the contact information for the receiving PHAs that serve the area, and the family selects the receiving PHA. The family must inform the initial PHA which PHA it has selected as the receiving PHA. In cases where the family prefers not to select the receiving PHA, the initial PHA selects the receiving PHA on behalf of the family. HUD may determine in certain instances that a PHA is not required to accept incoming portable families, such as a PHA in a declared disaster area. However, the PHA must have approval in writing from HUD before refusing any incoming portable families.
(c)
Portability procedures.
The following portability procedures must be followed:
(1) When the family decides to use the voucher outside of the PHA jurisdiction, the family must notify the initial PHA of its desire to relocate and must specify the location where it wants to live.
(2) The initial PHA must determine the family's eligibility to move in accordance with §§ 982.353 and 982.354.
(3) Once the receiving PHA is determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the initial PHA must contact the receiving PHA, via email or other confirmed delivery method, prior to approving the family's request to move in order to determine whether the voucher will be absorbed or billed by the receiving PHA. The receiving PHA must advise the initial PHA in writing, via email or other confirmed delivery method, of its decision.
(4) If the receiving PHA notifies the initial PHA that it will absorb the voucher, the receiving PHA cannot reverse its decision at a later date without consent of the initial PHA.
(5) If the receiving PHA will bill the initial PHA for the portability voucher and the cost of the HAP will increase due to the move, the initial PHA may deny the move if it does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance in accordance with § 982.354 (e)(1).
(6) If a billing arrangement is approved by the initial PHA or if the voucher is to be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA must issue the family a voucher to move, if it has not already done so, and advise the family how to contact and request assistance from the receiving PHA.
(7) The initial PHA must promptly notify the receiving PHA to expect the family. The initial PHA must give the receiving PHA the form HUD-52665, the most recent form HUD 50058 (Family Report) for the family, and all related verification information.
(8) The family must promptly contact the receiving PHA in order to be informed of the receiving PHA's procedures for incoming portable families and comply with these procedures. The family's failure to comply may result in denial or termination of the receiving PHA's voucher.
(9) The receiving PHA does not redetermine eligibility for a participant family. However, for a family that was not already receiving assistance in the PHA's HCV program, the initial PHA must determine whether the family is eligible for admission to the receiving PHA's HCV program. In determining income eligibility, the receiving PHA's income limits are used by the initial PHA.
(10) When a receiving PHA assists a family under portability, administration of the voucher must be in accordance with the receiving PHA's policies. This requirement also applies to policies of Moving to Work agencies. The receiving PHA procedures and preferences for selection among eligible applicants do not apply to the family, and the receiving PHA waiting list is not used.
(11) If the receiving PHA opts to conduct a new reexamination for a current participant family, the receiving PHA may not delay issuing the family a voucher or otherwise delay approval of a unit.
(12) The receiving PHA must determine the family unit size for the family, and base its determination on the subsidy standards of the receiving PHA.
(13) The receiving PHA must issue a voucher to the family. The term of the receiving PHA voucher may not expire before 30 calendar days from the expiration date of the initial PHA voucher. If the voucher expires before the family arrives at the receiving PHA, the receiving PHA must contact the initial PHA to determine if it will extend the voucher.
(14) Once the receiving PHA issues the portable family a voucher, the receiving PHA's policies on extensions of the voucher term apply. The receiving PHA must notify the initial PHA of any extensions granted to the term of the voucher.
(15) The family must submit a request for tenancy approval to the receiving PHA during the term of the receiving PHA voucher. As required in § 982.303, if the family submits a request for tenancy approval during the term of the voucher, the PHA must suspend the term of that voucher.
(16) The receiving PHA must promptly notify the initial PHA if the family has leased an eligible unit under the program, or if the family fails to submit a request for tenancy approval for an eligible unit within the term of the voucher.
(17) At any time, either the initial PHA or the receiving PHA may make a determination to deny or terminate assistance to the family in accordance with § 982.552 and 982.553.
(d)
Absorption by the receiving PHA.
(1) If funding is available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program, the receiving PHA may absorb the family into the receiving PHA's HCV program. After absorption, the family is assisted with funds available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program.
(2) HUD may require that the receiving PHA absorb all, or a portion of, incoming portable families. Under circumstances described in a notice published in the
Federal Register,
HUD may determine that receiving PHAs, or categories of receiving PHAs, should absorb all or a portion of incoming portable families. If HUD makes such a determination, HUD will provide an opportunity for public comment, for a period of no less than 60 calendar days, on such policy and procedures. After consideration of public comments, HUD will publish a final notice in the
Federal Register
advising PHAs and the public of HUD's final determination on the subject of mandatory absorption of incoming portable families.
(3) HUD may provide financial or nonfinancial incentives (or both) to PHAs that absorb portability vouchers.
(e)
Portability billing.
(1) To cover assistance for a portable family that was not absorbed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the receiving PHA may bill the initial PHA for housing assistance payments and administrative fees.
(2) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the full amount of the housing assistance payments made by the receiving PHA for the portable family. The amount of the housing assistance payment for a portable family in the receiving PHA program is determined in the same manner as for other families in the receiving PHA program.
(3) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's ongoing administrative fee for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month for which the receiving PHA is billing the initial PHA under this section. If administrative fees are prorated for the HCV program, the proration will apply to the amount of the administrative fee for which the receiving PHA may bill under this section (e.g., the receiving PHA may bill for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee). If both PHAs agree, the PHAs may negotiate a different amount of reimbursement.
(4) When a portable family moves out of the HCV program of a receiving PHA that has not absorbed the family, the PHA in the new jurisdiction to which the family moves becomes the receiving PHA, and the first receiving PHA is no longer required to provide assistance for the family.
(5) In administration of portability, the initial PHA and the receiving PHA must comply with financial procedures
required by HUD, including the use of HUD-required billing forms. The initial and receiving PHA must also comply with billing and payment deadlines under the financial procedures.
(6) A PHA must manage the PHA HCV program in a manner that ensures that the PHA has the financial ability to provide assistance for families that move out of the PHA's program under the portability procedures, and that have not been absorbed by the receiving PHA, as well as for families that remain in the PHA's program.
(7) HUD may reduce the administrative fee to an initial or receiving PHA if the PHA does not comply with HUD portability requirements.
(f)
Portability funding.
(1) HUD may transfer units and funds for assistance to portable families to the receiving PHA from funds available under the initial PHA ACC.
(2) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the initial PHA for funds transferred to a receiving PHA for portability purposes.
(3) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the receiving PHA for absorption of portable families.
(4) HUD may require the receiving PHA to absorb portable families.
(g)
Special purpose vouchers.
(1) The initial PHA must submit the codes used for special purpose vouchers on the form HUD-50058, Family Report, and the receiving PHA must maintain the codes on the Family Report, as long as the Receiving PHA chooses to bill the initial PHA.
(2) Initial and receiving PHAs must administer special purpose vouchers, such as the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing vouchers, in accordance with HUD-established policy in cases where HUD has established alternative program requirements of such special purpose vouchers.

# Subpart I—Dwelling Unit: Housing Quality Standards, Subsidy Standards, Inspection and Maintenance

# Source:
60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 982.401
Housing quality standards.
As defined in § 982.4, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3).
[89 FR 38296, May 7, 2024]
§ 982.402
Subsidy standards.
(a)
Purpose.
(1) The PHA must establish subsidy standards that determine the number of bedrooms needed for families of different sizes and compositions.
(2) For each family, the PHA determines the appropriate number of bedrooms under the PHA subsidy standards (family unit size).
(3) The family unit size number is entered on the voucher issued to the family. The PHA issues the family a voucher for the family unit size when a family is selected for participation in the program.
(b)
Determining family unit size.
The following requirements apply when the PHA determines family unit size under the PHA subsidy standards:
(1) The subsidy standards must provide for the smallest number of bedrooms needed to house a family without overcrowding.
(2) The subsidy standards must be consistent with space requirements under the HQS (See § 982.401).
(3) The subsidy standards must be applied consistently for all families of like size and composition.
(4) A child who is temporarily away from the home because of placement in foster care is considered a member of the family in determining the family unit size.
(5) A family that consists of a pregnant woman (with no other persons) must be treated as a two-person family.
(6) Any live-in aide (approved by the PHA to reside in the unit to care for a
family member who is disabled or is at least 50 years of age) must be counted in determining the family unit size;
(7) Unless a live-in-aide resides with the family, the family unit size for any family consisting of a single person must be either a zero or one-bedroom unit, as determined under the PHA subsidy standards.
(8) In determining family unit size for a particular family, the PHA may grant an exception to its established subsidy standards if the PHA determines that the exception is justified by the age, sex, health, handicap, or relationship of family members or other personal circumstances. (For a single person other than a disabled or elderly person or remaining family member, such PHA exception may not override the limitation in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.)
(c)
Effect of family unit size-maximum subsidy in voucher program.
The family unit size as determined for a family under the PHA subsidy standard is used to determine the maximum rent subsidy for a family assisted in the voucher program. For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standard for a family shall be the lower of:
(1) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or
(2) The payment standard amount for the unit size of the unit rented by the family.
(3)
Voucher program.
For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standards for the family must be the lower of:
(i) The payment standards for the family unit size; or
(ii) The payment standard for the unit size rented by the family.
(d)
Size of unit occupied by family.
(1) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with fewer bedrooms than the family unit size. However, the dwelling unit must meet the applicable HQS space requirements.
(2) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with more bedrooms than the family unit size. However, utility allowances must follow § 982.517(d).
[60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998; 64 FR 26646, May 14, 1999; 81 FR 12375, Mar. 8, 2016; 88 FR 30503, May 11, 2023; 89 FR 38296, May 7, 2024; 89 FR 46020, May 28, 2024]
§ 982.403
Terminating HAP contract when unit is too small.
(a)
Violation of HQS space standards.
(1) If the PHA determines that a unit does not meet the HQS space standards because of an increase in family size or a change in family composition, the PHA must issue the family a new voucher, and the family and PHA must try to find an acceptable unit as soon as possible.
(2) If an acceptable unit is available for rental by the family, the PHA must terminate the HAP contract in accordance with its terms.
(b)
Termination.
When the PHA terminates the HAP contract under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) The PHA must notify the family and the owner of the termination; and
(2) The HAP contract terminates at the end of the calendar month that follows the calendar month in which the PHA gives such notice to the owner.
(3) The family may move to a new unit in accordance with § 982.354.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0169)
[60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 45661, Sept. 1, 1995; 64 FR 26647, May 14, 1999; 80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015; 80 FR 50575, Aug. 20, 2015]
§ 982.404
Maintenance: Owner and family responsibility; PHA remedies.
(a)
Owner obligation.
(1) The owner must maintain the unit in accordance with HQS. A unit is not in compliance with HQS if the PHA or other inspector authorized by the State or local government determines that the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection, the agency or inspector notifies the owner in writing of the HQS deficiencies, and the deficiencies are not remedied within the appropriate timeframe.
(2) If the owner fails to maintain the dwelling unit in accordance with HQS,
the PHA must take enforcement action in accordance with this section.
(3) If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days of notification (or any reasonable PHA-approved extension).
(4) In the case of an HQS deficiency that the PHA determines is caused by the tenant, any member of the household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, other than any damage resulting from ordinary use, the PHA may waive the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation. The HAP to the owner may not be withheld or abated if the owner responsibility has been waived. However, the PHA may terminate assistance to a family because of an HQS breach beyond damage resulting from ordinary use caused by any member of the household or any guest or other person under the tenant's control.
(b)
Family obligation.
(1) The family may be held responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:
(i) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the owner is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the tenant;
(ii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the owner is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the tenant; or
(iii) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear)
(2) If the PHA has waived the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the following applies:
(i) If the HQS breach caused by the family is life-threatening, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 24 hours of notification.
(ii) For other family-caused deficiencies, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure that the deficiency is corrected within 30 calendar days of notification (or any PHA-approved extension).
(3) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for the family in accordance with § 982.552.
(c)
Determination of noncompliance with HQS.
The unit is in noncompliance with HQS if:
(1) The PHA or authorized inspector determines the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection;
(2) The PHA notified the owner in writing of the unit HQS deficiencies; and
(3) The unit HQS deficiencies are not corrected in accordance with the timeframes established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(d)
PHA remedies for HQS deficiencies identified during inspections other than the initial inspection.
This subsection covers PHA actions when HQS deficiencies are identified as a result of an inspection other than the initial inspection (see § 982.405). For PHA HQS enforcement actions for HQS deficiencies under the initial HQS inspection NLT or alternative inspection options, see §§ 982.405(j) and 982.406(e), respectively.
(1) A PHA may withhold assistance payments for units that have HQS deficiencies once the PHA has notified the owner in writing of the deficiencies. The PHA must identify in its Administrative Plan the conditions under which it will withhold HAP. If the unit is brought into compliance during the applicable cure period (within 24 hours of notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days of notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies), the PHA:
(i) Must resume assistance payments; and
(ii) Must provide assistance payments to cover the time period for which the assistance payments were withheld.
(2)(i) The PHA must abate the HAP, including amounts that had been withheld, if the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable cure period (within 24 hours of notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30
days of notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies).
(ii) If a PHA abates the assistance payments under this paragraph, the PHA must notify the family and the owner that it is abating payments and that if the unit does not meet HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) after the determination of noncompliance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the unit, and the family will have to move if the family wishes to receive continued assistance. The PHA must issue the family its voucher to move at least 30 days prior to the termination of the HAP contract.
(3) An owner may not terminate the tenancy of any family due to the withholding or abatement of assistance under paragraph (a) of this section. During the period that assistance is abated, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner and the PHA. If the family chooses to terminate the tenancy, the HAP contract will automatically terminate on the effective date of the tenancy termination or the date the family vacates the unit, whichever is earlier. The PHA must promptly issue the family its voucher to move.
(4) If the family did not terminate the tenancy and the owner makes the repairs and the unit complies with HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner. The PHA does not make any payments to the owner for the period of time that the payments were abated.
(5) If the owner fails to make the repairs within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must terminate the HAP contract.
(e)
Relocation due to HQS deficiencies.
(1) The PHA must give any family residing in a unit for which the HAP contract is terminated under paragraph (d)(5) of this section due to a failure to correct HQS deficiencies at least 90 days or a longer period as the PHA determines is reasonably necessary following the termination of the HAP contract to lease a new unit.
(2) If the family is unable to lease a new unit within the period provided by the PHA under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the PHA owns or operates public housing, the PHA must offer, and, if accepted, provide the family a selection preference for an appropriate-size public housing unit that first becomes available for occupancy after the time period expires.
(3) PHAs may assist families relocating under this paragraph (e) in finding a new unit, including using up to 2 months of the withheld and abated assistance payments for costs directly associated with relocating to a new unit, including security deposits, temporary housing costs, or other reasonable moving costs as determined by the PHA based on their locality. If the PHA uses the withheld and abated assistance payments to assist with the family's relocation costs, the PHA must provide security deposit assistance to the family as necessary. PHAs must assist families with disabilities in locating available accessible units in accordance with 24 CFR 8.28(a)(3). If the family receives security deposit assistance from the PHA for the new unit, the PHA may require the family to remit the security deposit returned by the owner of the new unit at such time that the lease is terminated, up to the amount of the security deposit assistance provided by the PHA for that unit. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the policies it will implement for this provision.
(f)
Applicability.
This section is applicable to HAP contracts that were either executed on or after or renewed after June 6, 2024. For purposes of this paragraph, a HAP contract is renewed if the HAP contract continues beyond the initial term of the lease. For all other HAP contracts, § 982.404 as in effect on June 6, 2024 remains applicable.
[60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 45661, Sept. 1, 1995; 89 FR 38296, May 7, 2024]
§ 982.405
PHA unit inspection.
(a)
Initial Inspections.
The PHA must inspect the unit leased to a family prior to the initial term of the lease to determine if the unit meets the HQS.
(
See
§ 982.305(b)(2) concerning timing of initial inspection by the PHA.)
(b)
Periodic Inspections.
The PHA must inspect the unit at least biennially during assisted occupancy to ensure that the unit continues to meet the HQS, except that a small rural PHA, as defined in § 902.101 of this title, must inspect a unit once every three years during assisted occupancy to ensure that the unit continues to meet the HQS.
(c)
Supervisory Quality Control Inspections.
The PHA must conduct supervisory quality control HQS inspections.
(d)
Interim Inspections.
When a participant family or government official notifies the PHA of a potential deficiency, the following conditions apply:
(1)
Life-Threatening.
If the reported deficiency is life-threatening, the PHA must, within 24 hours of notification, both inspect the housing unit and notify the owner if the life-threatening deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 24 hours of PHA notification.
(2)
Non-Life-Threatening.
If the reported deficiency is non-life-threatening, the PHA must, within 15 days of notification, both inspect the unit and notify the owner if the deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 30 days of notification from the PHA or within any PHA-approved extension.
(3)
Extraordinary circumstances.
In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may approve an exception of the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.
(e)
Scheduling inspections.
In scheduling inspections, the PHA must consider complaints and any other information brought to the attention of the PHA.
(f)
PHA notification of owner.
The PHA must notify the owner of deficiencies shown by the inspection.
(g)
Charge to family for inspection.
The PHA may not charge the family for an initial inspection or reinspection of the unit.
(h)
Charge to owner for inspection.
The PHA may not charge the owner for the inspection of the unit prior to the initial term of the lease or for a first inspection during assisted occupancy of the unit. The PHA may establish a reasonable fee to owners for a reinspection if an owner notifies the PHA that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible for repairing, pursuant to § 982.404(a), was not corrected. The owner may not pass this fee along to the family. Fees collected under this paragraph (h) will be included in a PHA's administrative fee reserve and may be used only for activities related to the provision of the HCV program.
(i)
Verification methods.
When a PHA must verify correction of a deficiency, the PHA may use verification methods other than another on-site inspection. The PHA may establish different verification methods for initial and non-initial inspections or for different HQS deficiencies. Upon either an inspection for initial occupancy or a reinspection, the PHA may accept photographic evidence or other reliable evidence from the owner to verify that a deficiency has been corrected.
(j)
Initial HQS inspection option: No life-threatening deficiencies.
(1) A PHA may elect to approve an assisted tenancy, execute the HAP contract, and begin making assistance payments for a unit that failed the initial HQS inspection, provided that the unit has no life-threatening deficiencies. A PHA that implements this option (NLT option) may apply the option to all the PHA's initial inspections or may limit the use of the option to certain units. The PHA's Administrative Plan must specify the circumstances under which the PHA will exercise the NLT option. If the PHA has established, and the unit is covered by, both the NLT option and the alternative inspections option for the initial HQS inspection, see § 982.406(f).
(2) The PHA must notify the owner and the family if the NLT option is available for the unit selected by the family. After completing the inspection and determining there are no life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA provides both the owner and the family
with a list of all the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and, should the owner not complete the repairs within 30 days, the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will terminate the HAP contract, and the family will have to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. The family may choose to decline the unit based on the deficiencies and continue its housing search.
(3) If the family decides to lease the unit, the PHA and the owner execute the HAP contract, and the family enters into the assisted lease with the owner. The PHA commences making assistance payments to the owner.
(4) The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA may use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(5) A PHA relying on the non-life-threatening inspection provision must identify in the PHA Administrative Plan all the optional policies identified in § 982.54(d)(21)(i) and (ii).
(6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:
(i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and
(ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.
[89 FR 38298, May 7, 2024]
§ 982.406
Use of alternative inspections.
(a)
In general.
A PHA may comply with the inspection requirements in § 982.405(a) and (b) by relying on an alternative inspection (
i.e.,
an inspection conducted for another housing program) only if the PHA is able to obtain the results of the alternative inspection. The PHA may implement the use of alternative inspections for both initial and periodic inspections or may limit the use of alternative inspections to either initial or periodic inspections. The PHA may limit the use of alternative inspections to certain units, as provided in the PHA's Administrative Plan.
(b)
Administrative Plan.
A PHA relying on an alternative inspection must identify in the PHA Administrative Plan all the optional policies identified in § 982.54(d)(21)(iii).
(c)
Eligible inspection methods.
(1) A PHA may rely upon inspections of housing assisted under the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program or housing financed using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), or inspections performed by HUD.
(2) If a PHA wishes to rely on an inspection method other than a method listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then, prior to amending its Administrative Plan, the PHA must submit to the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) a copy of the inspection method it wishes to use, along with its analysis of the inspection method that shows that the method “provides the same or greater protection to occupants of dwelling units” as would HQS.
(i) A PHA may rely upon such alternative inspection method only upon receiving approval from REAC to do so.
(ii) A PHA that uses an alternative inspection method approved under this paragraph must monitor changes to the standards and requirements applicable to such method. If any change is made to the alternative inspection method, then the PHA must submit to REAC a copy of the revised standards and requirements, along with a revised comparison to HQS. If the PHA or REAC determines that the revision would cause the alternative inspection to no longer meet or exceed HQS, then the PHA may no longer rely upon the
alternative inspection method to comply with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a) and (b).
(d)
Use of alternative inspection.
(1) If an alternative inspection method employs sampling, then a PHA may rely on such alternative inspection method for purposes of an initial or periodic inspection only if units occupied by voucher program participants are included in the population of units forming the basis of the sample.
(2) In order for a PHA to rely upon the results of an alternative inspection for purposes of an initial or periodic inspection, a property inspected pursuant to such method must meet the standards or requirements regarding housing quality or safety applicable to properties assisted under the program using the alternative inspection method. To make the determination of whether such standards or requirements are met, the PHA must adhere to the following procedures:
(i) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “pass” score, then the PHA may rely on that inspection.
(ii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “fail” score, then the PHA may not rely on that inspection.
(iii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method that does not employ a pass/fail determination—for example, in the case of a program where deficiencies are simply identified—then the PHA must review the list of deficiencies to determine whether any cited deficiency would have resulted in a “fail” score under HQS. If no such deficiency exists, then the PHA may rely on the inspection. If such a deficiency does exist, then the PHA may not rely on the inspection.
(3) Under any circumstance described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in which a PHA is prohibited from relying on an alternative inspection method for a property, the PHA must, within a reasonable period of time, conduct an HQS inspection of any units in the property occupied by voucher program participants and follow HQS procedures to remedy any identified deficiencies.
(e)
Initial inspections using the alternative inspection option.
(1) The PHA may approve the tenancy, allow the family to enter into the lease agreement, and execute the HAP contract for a unit that has been inspected in the previous 24 months where the alternative inspection meets the requirements of this section. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option under § 982.405(j) and the alternative inspections option for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) The PHA notifies the owner and the family that the unit selected by the family is eligible for the alternative inspection option. The PHA must provide the family with the PHA list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. If the owner and family agree to the use of this option, the PHA approves the assisted tenancy, allows the family to enter into the lease agreement with the owner, and executes the HAP contract on the basis of the alternative inspection.
(3) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days of receiving the Request for Tenancy Approval. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's HQS inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under § 982.405(d) or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.
(4) The PHA must enter into the HAP contract with the owner before conducting the HQS inspection. The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected the unit.
(5) The PHA may commence housing assistance payments to the owner and make housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract only after the unit passes the PHA's HQS inspection. If the unit does not pass the HQS inspection, the PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected. If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within no more than 30 calendar days
(or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.
(6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:
(i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner does not correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and
(ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.
(f)
Initial inspection: using the alternative inspection option in combination with the non-life-threatening deficiencies option.
(1) The PHA notifies the owner and the family that both the alternative inspection option and the NLT option are available for the unit selected by the family. The PHA must provide the family the list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. If the owner and family agree to the use of both options, the PHA approves the assisted tenancy, allows the family to enter into the lease agreement with the owner, and executes the HAP contract on the basis of the alternative inspection.
(2) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days after the family and owner submit a complete Request for Tenancy Approval. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's HQS inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under § 982.405(d) or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.
(3) The PHA must enter into the HAP contract with the owner before conducting the HQS inspection. The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected the unit. If the unit passes the HQS inspection, the PHA commences making housing assistance payments to the owner and makes payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.
(4) If the unit fails the PHA's HQS inspection but has no life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA commences making housing assistance payments, which are made retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract. The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the unit is in compliance with HQS, the PHA may use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(5) If the unit does not pass the HQS inspection and has life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA may not commence making housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected. The owner must correct all life-threatening deficiencies within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 days (or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract.
(6) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan:
(i) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and
(ii) The date by which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.
(g) Records retention. As with all other inspection reports, and as required by § 982.158(f)(4), reports for inspections conducted pursuant to an alternative inspection method must be obtained by the PHA. Such reports must be available for HUD inspection
for at least three years from the date of the latest inspection.

# Subpart J—Housing Assistance Payments Contract and Owner Responsibility

# Source:
60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 982.451
Housing assistance payments contract.
(a)
Form and term.
(1) The HAP contract must be in the form required by HUD.
(2) The term of the HAP contract is the same as the term of the lease.
(b)
Housing assistance payment amount.
(1) The amount of the monthly housing assistance payment by the PHA to the owner is determined by the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements. The amount of the housing assistance payment is subject to change during the HAP contract term.
(2) The monthly housing assistance payment by the PHA is credited toward the monthly rent to owner under the family's lease.
(3) The total of rent paid by the tenant plus the PHA housing assistance payment to the owner may not be more than the rent to owner. The owner must immediately return any excess payment to the PHA.
(4)(i) The part of the rent to owner that is paid by the tenant may not be more than:
(A) The rent to owner; minus
(B) The PHA housing assistance payment to the owner.
(ii) The owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of this maximum, and must immediately return any excess rent payment to the tenant.
(iii) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the PHA. See § 982.310(b).
(5)(i) The PHA must pay the housing assistance payment promptly when due to the owner in accordance with the HAP contract.
(ii)(A) The HAP contract shall provide for penalties against the PHA for late payment of housing assistance payments due to the owner if all the following circumstances apply:
(
1
) Such penalties are in accordance with generally accepted practices and law, as applicable in the local housing market, governing penalties for late payment of rent by a tenant;
(
2
) It is the owner's practice to charge such penalties for assisted and unassisted tenants; and
(
3
) The owner also charges such penalties against the tenant for late payment of family rent to owner.
(B) The PHA is not obligated to pay any late payment penalty if HUD determines that late payment by the PHA is due to factors beyond the PHA's control. The PHA may add HAP contract provisions which define when the housing assistance payment by the PHA is deemed received by the owner (
e.g.,
upon mailing by the PHA or actual receipt by the owner).
(iii) The PHA may only use the following sources to pay a late payment penalty from program receipts under the consolidated ACC: administrative fee income for the program, or the administrative fee reserve for the program. The PHA may not use other program receipts for this purpose.

# Subpart K—Rent and Housing Assistance Payment

# Source:
63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 982.501
Overview.
This subpart describes program requirements concerning the housing assistance payment and rent to owner under the HCV program.
[80 FR 8246, Feb. 17, 2015]
§ 982.503
Payment standard areas, schedule, and amounts.
(a)
Payment standard areas.
(1) Annually, HUD publishes fair market rents (FMRs) for U.S. Postal Service ZIP code areas, metropolitan areas, and nonmetropolitan counties (see 24 CFR 888.113). Within each of these FMR areas, the applicable FMR is:
(i) The HUD-published Small Area FMR for:
(A) Any metropolitan area designated as a Small Area FMR area by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1).
(B) Any area where a PHA has notified HUD that the PHA will voluntarily use SAFMRs in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3).
(ii) The HUD-published metropolitan FMR for any other metropolitan area.
(iii) The HUD-published FMR for any other non-metropolitan county.
(2) The PHA must adopt a payment standard schedule that establishes voucher payment standard amounts for each FMR area in the PHA jurisdiction. These payment standard amounts are used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family (§ 982.505).
(3) The PHA may designate payment standard areas within each FMR area. The PHA may establish different payment standard amounts for such designated areas. If the PHA designates payment standard areas, then it must include in its Administrative Plan the criteria used to determine the designated areas and the payment standard amounts for those areas.
(i) The PHA may designate payment standard areas within which payment standards will be established according to paragraph (c) (basic range) or paragraph (d) (exception payment standard), of this section.
(ii) A PHA-designated payment standard area may be no smaller than a census tract block group.
(b)
Payment standard schedule.
For each payment standard area, the PHA must establish a payment standard amount for each unit size, measured by number of bedrooms (zero-bedroom, one-bedroom, and so on). These payment standard amounts comprise the PHA's payment standard schedule.
(c)
Basic range payment standard amounts.
A basic range payment standard amount is any dollar amount that is in the range from 90 percent up to 110 percent of the published FMR for a unit size.
(1) The PHA may establish a payment standard amount within the basic range without HUD approval or prior notification to HUD.
(2) The PHA's basic range payment standard amount for each unit size may be based on the same percentage of the published FMR (
i.e.,
all payment standard amounts may be set at 100 percent of the FMR), or the PHA may establish different payment standard amounts for different unit sizes (for example, 90 percent for efficiencies, 100 percent for 1-bedroom units, 110 percent for larger units).
(3) The PHA must revise its payment standard amounts and schedule no later than 3 months following the effective date of the published FMR if revisions are necessary to stay within the basic range.
(d)
Exception payment standard amounts.
An exception payment standard amount is a dollar amount that exceeds 110 percent of the published FMR.
(1) The PHA may establish exception payment standard amounts for all units, or for units of a particular size. The exception payment standard may be established for a designated part of the FMR area (called an “exception area”) or for the entire FMR area. The exception area must meet the minimum area requirement at § 982.503(a)(3)(ii).
(2) A PHA that is not in a designated Small Area FMR area or has not opted voluntarily to implement Small Area FMRs under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3) may establish exception payment standards for a ZIP code area that exceed the basic range for the metropolitan area or county FMR as long as the amounts established by the PHA do not exceed 110 percent of the HUD published SAFMR for the applicable ZIP code. The exception payment standard must apply to the entire ZIP code area. If an exception area crosses one or more FMR boundaries, then the maximum exception payment standard amount that a PHA may adopt for the exception area without HUD approval is 110 percent of the ZIP code area with the lowest SAFMR amount. If the PHA qualifies for an exception payment standard above 110 percent of the applicable FMR under paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, it may establish exception payment standards up to the same percentage of the SAFMR for the applicable ZIP code.
(3) A PHA may establish exception payment standard amounts between 110 percent and 120 percent of the applicable FMR for such duration as HUD specifies by notice upon notification to HUD that the PHA meets at least one of the following criteria:
(i) Fewer than 75 percent of the families to whom the PHA issued tenant-based rental vouchers during the most recent 12-month period for which there is success rate data available have become participants in the voucher program;
(ii) More than 40 percent of families with tenant-based rental assistance administered by the agency pay more than 30 percent of adjusted income as the family share; or
(iii) Such other criteria as the Secretary establishes by notice.
(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (5) of this section, the PHA must request approval from HUD to establish an exception payment standard amount that exceeds 110 percent of the applicable FMR. In its request to HUD, the PHA must provide rental market data demonstrating that the requested exception payment standard amount is needed for families to access rental units. The rental market data must include a rent estimate for the entire FMR area compared with a rent estimate for the proposed exception area. To apply the exception payment standard to the entire FMR area, the rental market data provided by the PHA must also provide data that demonstrates that the annual percentage of rent inflation in the FMR area is greater than the rental inflation adjustment factor in the calculation of the published FMR. Once HUD has approved the exception payment standard for the requesting PHA, any other PHA with jurisdiction in the HUD approved exception payment standard area may also use the exception payment standard amount.
(5) If required as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 for a person with a disability, the PHA may establish, without HUD approval or prior notification to HUD, an exception payment standard amount for an individual family that does not exceed 120 percent of the applicable FMR. A PHA may establish a
payment standard greater than 120 percent of the applicable FMR as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability in accordance with 24 CFR part 8, after requesting and receiving HUD approval.
(e)
Payment standard amount below 90 percent of the applicable FMR.
HUD may consider a PHA request for approval to establish a payment standard amount that is lower than the basic range. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve PHA establishment of a payment standard lower than the basic range. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including rent burden of families assisted under the program. Unless it is necessary to prevent termination of program participants, HUD will not approve a lower payment standard if the proposed payment standard would, if it were used to calculate the housing assistance payments for current participants in the PHA's voucher program using currently available data, cause the family share for more than 40 percent of participants with tenant-based rental assistance to exceed 30 percent of adjusted monthly income.
(f)
Phaseout of success rate payment standard amounts.
HUD will no longer approve success rate payment standards. However, a PHA that was approved to establish a success rate payment standard amount under this paragraph as in effect prior to June 6, 2024 shall not be required to reduce such payment standard amount as a result of the discontinuance of success rate payment standards.
(g)
Payment standard protection for PHAs that meet deconcentration objectives.
This paragraph applies only to a PHA with jurisdiction in an FMR area where the FMR had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent to provide a broad range of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area, pursuant to 24 CFR 888.113(i)(3), but is now set at the 40th percentile rent.
(1) Such a PHA may obtain HUD Field Office approval of a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent if the PHA scored the maximum number of points on the deconcentration bonus indicator in 24 CFR 985.3(h) in the prior year, or in two of the last three years.
(2) HUD approval of payment standard amounts based on the 50th percentile rent shall be for all unit sizes in the FMR area that had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent pursuant to 24 CFR 888.113(i)(3). A PHA may opt to establish a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent for one or more unit sizes in all or a designated part of the PHA jurisdiction within the FMR area.
(h)
HUD review of PHA payment standard schedules.
(1) HUD will monitor rent burdens of families assisted with tenant-based rental assistance in a PHA's voucher program. HUD will review the PHA's payment standard for a particular unit size if HUD finds that 40 percent or more of such families occupying units of that unit size currently pay more than 30 percent of adjusted monthly income as the family share. Such determination may be based on the most recent examinations of family income.
(2) After such review, HUD may, at its discretion, require the PHA to modify payment standard amounts for any unit size on the PHA payment standard schedule. HUD may require the PHA to establish an increased payment standard amount within the basic range.
[89 FR 38300, May 7, 2024]
§ 982.504
Payment standard for family in restructured subsidized multifamily project.
(a) This section applies to HCV assistance if all the following conditions are applicable:
(1) Such HCV assistance is provided to a family pursuant to 24 CFR 401.421 when HUD has approved a restructuring plan, and the participating administrative entity has approved the use of tenant-based assistance to provide continued assistance for such families. Such tenant-based voucher assistance is provided for a family previously receiving project-based assistance in an eligible project (as defined in § 401.2 of this title) at the time when the project-based assistance terminates.
(2) The family chooses to remain in the restructured project with HCV assistance under the program and leases
a unit that does not exceed the family unit size;
(3) The lease for such assisted tenancy commences during the first year after the project-based assistance terminates.
(b) The initial payment standard for the family under such initial lease is the sum of the reasonable rent to owner for the unit plus the utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. (Determination of such initial payment standard for the family is not subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of § 982.505. Except for determination of the initial payment standard as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment standard and housing assistance payment for the family during the HAP contract term shall be determined in accordance with § 982.505.)
[64 FR 26649, May 14, 1999, as amended at 80 FR 8247, Feb. 17, 2015]
§ 982.505
How to calculate housing assistance payment.
(a)
Use of payment standard.
A payment standard is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family. The “payment standard” is the maximum monthly subsidy payment.
(b)
Amount of monthly housing assistance payment.
The PHA shall pay a monthly housing assistance payment on behalf of the family that is equal to the
lower
of:
(1) The payment standard for the family minus the total tenant payment; or
(2) The gross rent minus the total tenant payment.
(c) Payment standard for family—(1)
Applying the payment standard.
The payment standard for the family is the lower of:
(i) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or
(ii) The payment standard amount for the size of the dwelling unit rented by the family.
(2)
Separate payment standards.
If the PHA has established a separate payment standard amount for a designated part of an FMR area in accordance with § 982.503 (including an exception payment standard amount as determined in accordance with § 982.503(d)), and the dwelling unit is located in such designated part, the PHA must use the appropriate payment standard amount for such designated part to calculate the payment standard for the family.
(3)
Decrease in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.
The PHA may choose not to reduce the payment standard amount used to calculate the subsidy for a family for as long as the family continues to reside in the unit for which the family is receiving assistance.
(i) If the PHA chooses to reduce the payment standard amount used to calculate such a family's subsidy in accordance with its Administrative Plan, then the initial reduction to the family's payment standard amount may not be applied any earlier than two years following the effective date of the decrease in the payment standard, and then only if the family has received the notice required under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii) The PHA may choose to reduce the payment standard amount for the family to the current payment standard amount in effect on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule, or it may reduce the payment standard amount to an amount that is higher than the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule. After an initial reduction, the PHA may further reduce the payment standard amount for the family during the time the family resides in the unit, provided any subsequent reductions continue to result in a payment standard amount that meets or exceeds the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule.
(iii) The PHA must provide the family with at least 12 months' written notice of any reduction in the payment standard amount that will affect the family if the family remains in place. In the written notice, the PHA must state the new payment standard amount, explain that the family's new payment standard amount will be the greater of the amount listed in the current written notice or the new amount (if any) on the PHA's payment standard schedule at the end of the 12-month
period, and make clear where the family will find the PHA's payment standard schedule.
(iv) The PHA must administer decreases in the payment standard amount for the family in accordance with the PHA policy as described in the PHA Administrative Plan.
(4)
Increase in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.
If the payment standard amount is increased during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA must use the increased payment standard amount to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning no later than the earliest of:
(i) The effective date of an increase in the gross rent that would result in an increase in the family share;
(ii) The family's first regular or interim reexamination; or
(iii) One year following the effective date of the increase in the payment standard amount.
(5)
PHA policy on payment standard increases.
The PHA may adopt a policy to apply a payment standard increase at any time earlier than the date calculated according to paragraph (c)(4).
(6)
Changes in family unit size during the HAP contract term.
Irrespective of any increase or decrease in the payment standard amount, if the family unit size either increases or decreases during the HAP contract term, the new family unit size may be used to determine the payment standard amount for the family immediately but no later than the family's first regular reexamination following the change in family unit size.

§ 982.507
Rent to owner: Reasonable rent.
(a)
PHA determination.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA may not approve a lease until the PHA determines that the initial rent to owner is a reasonable rent.
(2) The PHA must redetermine the reasonable rent:
(i) Before any increase in the rent to owner;
(ii) If there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the contract anniversary (for the unit size rented by the family) as compared with the FMR in effect 1 year before the contract anniversary.
(iii) If directed by HUD.
(3) The PHA may also redetermine the reasonable rent at any other time.
(4) At all times during the assisted tenancy, the rent to owner may not exceed the reasonable rent as most recently determined or redetermined by the PHA.
(b)
Comparability.
The PHA must determine whether the rent to owner is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units. To make this determination, the PHA must consider:
(1) The location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the contract unit; and
(2) Any amenities, housing services, maintenance and utilities to be provided by the owner in accordance with the lease.
(c)
Units assisted by low-income housing tax credits or assistance under HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program.
(1)
General.
For a unit receiving low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs) pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or receiving assistance under HUD's HOME Program (for which the regulations are found in 24 CFR part 92), a rent comparison with unassisted units is not required if the voucher rent does not exceed the rent for other LIHTC- or HOME-assisted units in the project that are not occupied by families with tenant-based assistance.
(2)
LIHTC.
If the rent requested by the owner exceeds the LIHTC rents for non-voucher families, the PHA must perform a rent comparability study in accordance with program regulations
and the rent shall not exceed the lesser of the:
(i) Reasonable rent as determined pursuant to a rent comparability study; and
(ii) The payment standard established by the PHA for the unit size involved.
(3)
HOME Program.
[Reserved]
(d)
Owner certification of rents charged for other units.
By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.

§ 982.508
Maximum family share at initial occupancy.
At the time the PHA approves a tenancy for initial occupancy of a dwelling unit by a family with tenant-based assistance under the program, and where the gross rent of the unit exceeds the applicable payment standard for the family, the family share must not exceed 40 percent of the family's adjusted monthly income. The determination of adjusted monthly income must be based on verification information received by the PHA no earlier than 60 days before the PHA issues a voucher to the family.
[64 FR 59622, Nov. 3, 1999]
§ 982.509
Rent to owner: Effect of rent control.

§ 982.510
Other fees and charges.
(a) The cost of meals or supportive services may not be included in the rent to owner, and the value of meals or supportive services may not be included in the calculation of reasonable rent.
(b) The lease may not require the tenant or family members to pay charges for meals or supportive services. Non-payment of such charges is not grounds for termination of tenancy.
(c) The owner may not charge the tenant extra amounts for items customarily included in rent in the locality, or provided at no additional cost to unsubsidized tenants in the premises.
[63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998. Redesignated at 64 FR 26648, May 14, 1999]
§ 982.514
Distribution of housing assistance payment.
The monthly housing assistance payment is distributed as follows:
(a) The PHA pays the owner the lesser of the housing assistance payment or the rent to owner.
(b) If the housing assistance payment exceeds the rent to owner, the PHA may pay the balance of the housing assistance payment (“utility reimbursement”) either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.
(c) The PHA may elect to establish policies regarding the frequency of utility reimbursement payments for payments made to the family.
(1) The PHA will have the option of making utility reimbursement payments not less than once per calendar-year quarter, for reimbursements totaling $45 or less per quarter. In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the PHA would be required to reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.
(2) If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.
[63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 56914, Oct. 21, 1999; 65 FR 16822, Mar. 30, 2000; 81 FR 12376, Mar. 8, 2016]
§ 982.515
Family share: Family responsibility.
(a) The family share is calculated by subtracting the amount of the housing assistance payment from the gross rent.
(b) The family rent to owner is calculated by subtracting the amount of the housing assistance payment to the owner from the rent to owner.
(c) The PHA may not use housing assistance payments or other program funds (including any administrative fee reserve) to pay any part of the family share, including the family rent to owner. Payment of the whole family share is the responsibility of the family.
[63 FR 23861, Apr. 30, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 56915, Oct. 21, 1999]
§ 982.516
Family income and composition: Annual and interim examinations.
(a)
PHA responsibility for reexamination and verification.
(1) The PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least annually.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the PHA must obtain and document in the tenant file third-party verification of the following factors, or must document in the tenant file why third-party verification was not available:
(i) Reported family annual income;
(ii) The value of assets;
(iii) Expenses related to deductions from annual income; and
(iv) Other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income.
(3) For a family with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.
(b)
Streamlined income determination
—(1)
General.
A PHA may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2)
Definition of “fixed income”.
For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:
(i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.
(ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.
(iii) Annuities or other retirement benefit programs, insurance policies, disability or death benefits, or other similar types of periodic receipts.
(iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.
(3)
Method of streamlined income determination.
A PHA using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.
(i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's fixed-income sources, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, the PHA is not required to make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income individually. The PHA must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(4)
COLA rate applied by PHAs.
PHAs using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest
rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.
(5)
Triennial verification.
For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, a PHA must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.
(c)
Interim reexaminations.
(1) A family may request an interim determination of family income or composition because of any changes since the last determination. The PHA must conduct any interim reexamination within a reasonable period of time after the family request or when the PHA becomes aware of an increase in family adjusted income under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. What qualifies as a “reasonable time” may vary based on the amount of time it takes to verify information, but generally should not be longer than 30 days after changes in income are reported.
(2) The PHA may decline to conduct an interim reexamination of family income if the PHA estimates the family's adjusted income will decrease by an amount that is less than ten percent of the family's annual adjusted income (or a lower amount established by HUD through notice), or a lower threshold established by the PHA.
(3) The PHA must conduct an interim reexamination of family income when the PHA becomes aware that the family's adjusted income (as defined in § 5.611 of this title) has changed by an amount that the PHA estimates will result in an increase of ten percent or more in annual adjusted income or such other amount established by HUD through notice, except:
(i) The PHA may not consider any increase in the earned income of the family when estimating or calculating whether the family's adjusted income has increased, unless the family has previously received an interim reduction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section during the certification period; and
(ii) The PHA may choose not to conduct an interim reexamination in the last three months of a certification period.
(4)
Effective date of rent changes.
(i) If the family has reported a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, the PHA must provide the family with 30 days advance notice of any family share and family rent to owner increases, and such increases will be effective the first day of the month beginning after the end of that 30-day period. Family share and family rent to owner decreases will be effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the reported change leading to the interim reexamination of family income.
(ii) If the family has failed to report a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, PHAs must implement any resulting family share and family rent to owner increases retroactively to the first of the month following the date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income. Any resulting family share and family rent to owner decrease must be implemented no later than the first rent period following completion of the reexamination. However, a PHA may apply a family share and family rent to owner decrease retroactively at the discretion of the PHA, in accordance with the conditions established by the PHA in the Administrative Plan and subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii) A retroactive family share and family rent to owner decrease may not be applied prior to the later of the first of the month following:
(A) The date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income; or
(B) The effective date of the family's most recent previous interim or annual reexamination (or initial examination if that was the family's last examination).
(d)
Family reporting of change.
The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the family must
report a change in family income or composition.
(e)
Effective date of reexamination.
(1) The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing how to determine the effective date of a change in the housing assistance payment resulting from an interim redetermination.
(2) At the effective date of a regular or interim reexamination, the PHA must make appropriate adjustments in the housing assistance payment in accordance with § 982.505.
(f)
Accuracy of family income data.
The PHA must establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary to assure that income data provided by applicant or participant families is complete and accurate. The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).
(i) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their rent or family share as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Families will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for rent or family share.
(ii) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (f) through a rulemaking published in the
Federal Register
for public comment.
(g)
Execution of release and consent.
(1) As a condition of admission to or continued assistance under the program, the PHA shall require the family head, and such other family members as the PHA designates, to execute a HUD-approved release and consent form (including any release and consent as required under § 5.230 of this title) authorizing any depository or private source of income, or any Federal, State or local agency, to furnish or release to the PHA or HUD such information as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary.
(2) The PHA and HUD must limit the use or disclosure of information obtained from a family or from another source pursuant to this release and consent to purposes directly in connection with administration of the program.
(h) Reviews of family income under this section are subject to the provisions in section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3544).
(Information collection requirements contained in this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0169.)

§ 982.517
Utility allowance schedule.
(a)
Maintaining schedule.
(1) The PHA must maintain a utility allowance schedule for all tenant-paid utilities (except telephone), for cost of tenant-supplied refrigerators and ranges, and for other tenant-paid housing services (e.g., trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse)).
(2) The PHA must provide a copy of the utility allowance schedule to HUD. At HUD's request, the PHA also must provide any information or procedures used in preparation of the schedule.
(b)
How allowances are determined.
(1)(i) A PHA's utility allowance schedule, and the utility allowance for an individual family, must include the utilities and services that are necessary in the locality to provide housing that complies with HQS. The PHA's utility allowance schedule and utility allowance for families must also include any utilities and services required by HUD after publication in the
Federal Register
for public comment.
(ii) In the utility allowance schedule, the PHA must classify utilities and other housing services according to the following general categories: space heating; air conditioning; cooking;
water heating; water; sewer; trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse); other electric; refrigerator (cost of tenant-supplied refrigerator); range (cost of tenant-supplied range); applicable surcharges; and other specified housing services.
(iii) The PHA must provide a utility allowance for tenant-paid air-conditioning costs if the majority of housing units in the market provide centrally air-conditioned units or there is appropriate wiring for tenant-installed air conditioners.
(iv) The PHA may not provide any allowance for non-essential utility costs, such as costs of cable or satellite television.
(2)(i) The PHA must maintain an area-wide utility allowance schedule. The area-wide utility allowance schedule must be determined based on the typical cost of utilities and services paid by energy-conservative households that occupy housing of similar size and type in the same locality. In developing the schedule, the PHA must use normal patterns of consumption for the community as a whole and current utility rates.
(ii) The PHA may maintain an area-wide, energy-efficient utility allowance schedule to be used for units that are in a building that meets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or Energy Star standards. HUD may subsequently identify additional Energy Savings Design standards or criteria for applying the allowance to retrofitted units in a building that does not meet the standard, which will be modified or added through a document published in the
Federal Register
for 30 days of public comment, followed by a final document announcing the modified standards and the date on which the modifications take effect. The energy-efficient utility allowance (EEUA) schedule is to be maintained in addition to, not in place of, the area-wide utility allowance schedule described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, unless all units within a PHA's jurisdiction meet one or more of the required standards.
(iii) The PHA may base its utility allowance payments on actual flat fees charged by an owner for utilities that are billed directly by the owner, but only if the flat fee charged by the owner is no greater than the PHA's applicable utility allowance for the utilities covered by the fee. If an owner charges a flat fee for only some of the utilities, then the PHA must pay a separate allowance for any tenant-paid utilities that are not covered in the flat fee.
(iv) For tenant-based participants residing in units within a project that has an approved project-specific utility allowance under § 983.301(f)(4), the PHA must use the project-specific utility allowance schedule (see 24 CFR 983.301(f)(4)).
(v) The PHA must state its policy for utility allowance payments in its Administrative Plan and apply it consistently to all similarly situated households.
(c)
Revisions of utility allowance schedule.
(1) A PHA must review its schedule of utility allowances each year, and must revise its allowance for a utility category if there has been a change of 10 percent or more in the utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised. The PHA must maintain information supporting its annual review of utility allowances and any revisions made in its utility allowance schedule.
(2) At HUD's direction, the PHA must revise the utility allowance schedule to correct any errors, or as necessary to update the schedule.
(d)
Use of utility allowance schedule.
The PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the lesser of the size of dwelling unit actually leased by the family or the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards. In cases where the unit size leased exceeds the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards as a result of a reasonable accommodation, the PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the size of the dwelling unit actually leased by the family.
(e)
Higher utility allowance as reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities.
On request from a household that includes a person with disabilities, the PHA must approve a utility allowance which is higher than the applicable amount on the utility allowance schedule if a higher utility allowance
is needed as a reasonable accommodation under 24 CFR part 8, the Fair Housing Act and 24 CFR part 100, or Titles II or III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, to make the program accessible to and usable by the household member with a disability.

§ 982.521
Rent to owner in subsidized project.
(a)
Applicability to subsidized project.
This section applies to a program tenancy in any of the following types of federally subsidized project:
(1) An insured or non-insured Section 236 project;
(2) A Section 202 project;
(3) A Section 221(d)(3) below market interest rate (BMIR) project; or
(4) A Section 515 project of the Rural Development Administration.
(b)
How rent to owner is determined.
The rent to owner is the subsidized rent as determined in accordance with requirements for the applicable federal program listed in paragraph (a) of this section. This determination is not subject to the prohibition against increasing the rent to owner during the initial lease term (see § 982.309).

(i) If the family violates any family obligations under the program (see § 982.551). See § 982.553 concerning denial or termination of assistance for crime by family members.
(ii) If any member of the family has been evicted from federally assisted housing in the last five years;
(iii) If a PHA has ever terminated assistance under the program for any member of the family.
(iv) If any member of the family has committed fraud, bribery, or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any Federal housing program (see also § 982.553(a)(1));
(v) If the family currently owes rent or other amounts to the PHA or to another PHA in connection with Section 8 or public housing assistance under the 1937 Act.
(vi) If the family has not reimbursed any PHA for amounts paid to an owner under a HAP contract for rent, damages to the unit, or other amounts owed by the family under the lease.
(vii) If the family breaches an agreement with the PHA to pay amounts owed to a PHA, or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. (The PHA, at its discretion, may offer a family the opportunity to enter an agreement to pay amounts owed to a PHA or amounts paid to an owner by a PHA. The PHA may prescribe the terms of the agreement.)
(viii) If the family has engaged in or threatened abusive or violent behavior toward PHA personnel.
(ix) If a welfare-to-work (WTW) family fails, willfully and persistently, to fulfill its obligations under the welfare-to-work voucher program.
(x) If the family has been engaged in criminal activity or alcohol abuse as described in § 982.553.
(2)
Consideration of circumstances.
In determining whether to deny or terminate assistance because of action or failure to act by members of the family:
(i) The PHA may consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on
other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.
(ii) The PHA may impose, as a condition of continued assistance for other family members, a requirement that other family members who participated in or were culpable for the action or failure will not reside in the unit. The PHA may permit the other members of a participant family to continue receiving assistance.
(iii) In determining whether to deny admission or terminate assistance for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the PHA may require the applicant or tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.
(iv) If the family includes a person with disabilities, the PHA decision concerning such action is subject to consideration of reasonable accommodation in accordance with part 8 of this title.
(v)
Nondiscrimination limitation and protection for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
The PHA's admission and termination actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of 24 CFR 5.105, and with the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).
(d)
Information for family.
The PHA must give the family a written description of:
(1) Family obligations under the program.
(2) The grounds on which the PHA may deny or terminate assistance because of family action or failure to act.
(3) The PHA informal hearing procedures.
(e)
Applicant screening.
The PHA may at any time deny program assistance for an applicant in accordance with the PHA policy, as stated in the PHA Administrative Plan, on screening of applicants for family behavior or suitability for tenancy.

§ 982.553
Denial of admission and termination of assistance for criminals and alcohol abusers.
(a)
Denial of admission
—(1)
Prohibiting admission of drug criminals.
(i) The PHA
must
prohibit admission to the program of an applicant for three years from the date of eviction if a household member has been evicted from federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:
(A) That the evicted household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or
(B) That the circumstances leading to eviction no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).
(ii) The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission if:
(A) The PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug;
(B) The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or
(C) Any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.
(2)
Prohibiting admission of other criminals—(i) Mandatory prohibition.
The PHA
must
establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement
under a State sex offender registration program. In this screening of applicants, the PHA must perform criminal history background checks necessary to determine whether any household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement in the State where the housing is located and in other States where the household members are known to have resided.
(ii)
Permissive prohibitions.
(A) The PHA
may
prohibit admission of a household to the program if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaged in, or has engaged in during a reasonable time before the admission:
(1) Drug-related criminal activity;
(2) Violent criminal activity;
(3) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or persons residing in the immediate vicinity; or
(4) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health or safety of the owner, property management staff, or persons performing a contract administration function or responsibility on behalf of the PHA (including a PHA employee or a PHA contractor, subcontractor or agent).
(B) The PHA may establish a period before the admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in the activities specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section (“reasonable time”).
(C) If the PHA previously denied admission to an applicant because a member of the household engaged in criminal activity, the PHA may reconsider the applicant if the PHA has sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in, such criminal activity during a reasonable period, as determined by the PHA, before the admission decision.
(1) The PHA would have “sufficient evidence” if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which the PHA verified.
(2) For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.
(3)
Prohibiting admission of alcohol abusers.
The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(b)
Terminating assistance
—(1)
Terminating assistance for drug criminals.
(i) The PHA
must
establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that:
(A) Any household member is currently engaged in any illegal use of a drug; or
(B) A pattern of illegal use of a drug by any household member interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(ii) The PHA must immediately terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.
(iii) The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any family member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in any drug-related criminal activity.
(2)
Terminating assistance for other criminals.
The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any household member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in violent criminal activity.
(3)
Terminating assistance for alcohol abusers.
The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(c)
Evidence of criminal activity.
The PHA may terminate assistance for criminal activity by a household member as authorized in this section if the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the household member has engaged in the activity, regardless of whether the household member has been arrested or convicted for such activity.
(d)
Use of criminal record
—(1)
Denial.
If a PHA proposes to deny admission for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must provide the subject of the record and the applicant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record, in the informal review process in accordance with § 982.554. (See part 5, subpart J for provision concerning access to criminal records.)
(2)
Termination of assistance.
If a PHA proposes to terminate assistance for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in accordance with § 982.555.
(3)
Cost of obtaining criminal record.
The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.
(e) The requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.

The PHA may not restrict the family's freedom to choose among available units in accordance with § 982.353.
(e)
Applicability of requirements.
(1) Except as modified by this subpart, the requirements of other subparts of this part apply to the special housing types.

# Manufactured Home Space Rental
§ 982.622
Manufactured home space rental: Rent to owner.
(a)
What is included.
(1) Rent to owner for rental of a manufactured home space includes payment for maintenance and services that the owner must provide to the tenant under the lease for the space.
(2) Rent to owner does not include the costs of utilities and trash collection for the manufactured home. However, the owner may charge the family a separate fee for the cost of utilities or trash collection provided by the owner.
(b)
Reasonable rent.
(1) During the assisted tenancy, the rent to owner for the manufactured home space may not exceed a reasonable rent as determined in accordance with this section. Section 982.503 is not applicable.
(2) The PHA may not approve a lease for a manufactured home space until the PHA determines that the initial rent to owner for the space is a reasonable rent. At least annually during the assisted tenancy, the PHA must redetermine that the current rent to owner is a reasonable rent.
(3) The PHA must determine whether the rent to owner for the manufactured home space is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable manufactured home spaces. To make this determination, the PHA must consider the location and size of the space, and any services and maintenance to be provided by the owner in accordance with the lease (without a fee in addition to the rent).
(4) By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner of the manufactured home space certifies that the rent to owner for the space is not more than rent charged by the owner for unassisted rental of comparable spaces in the same manufactured home park or elsewhere. The owner must give the PHA information, as requested by the PHA, on rents charged by the owner for other manufactured home spaces.
§ 982.623
Manufactured home space rental: Housing assistance payment.
(a)
Amount of monthly housing assistance payment.
The monthly housing assistance payment is calculated as the lower of:
(1) The PHA payment standard, determined in accordance with § 982.503 minus the total tenant payment; or
(2) The family's eligible housing expenses minus the total tenant payment.
(b)
Eligible housing expenses.
The family's eligible housing expenses are the total of:
(1) The rent charged by the owner for the manufactured home space.
(2) Charges for the maintenance and management the space owner must provide under the lease.
(3) The monthly payments made by the family to amortize the cost of purchasing the manufactured home established at the time of application to a lender for financing the purchase of the manufactured home if monthly payments are still being made, including any required insurance and property taxes included in the loan payment to the lender.
(i) Any increase in debt service or term due to refinancing after purchase of the home may not be included in the amortization cost.
(ii) Debt service for installation charges incurred by a family may be included in the monthly amortization payments. Installation charges incurred before the family became an assisted family may be included in the amortization cost if monthly payments are still being made to amortize the charges.
(4) The applicable allowances for tenant-paid utilities, as determined under §§ 982.517 and 982.624.
(c)
Distribution of housing assistance payment.
In general, the monthly housing assistance payment is distributed as follows:
(1) The PHA pays the owner of the space the lesser of the housing assistance payment or the portion of the monthly rent due to the owner. The portion of the monthly rent due to the owner is the total of:
(i) The actual rent charged by the owner for the manufactured home space; and
(ii) Charges for the maintenance and management the space owner must provide under the lease.
(2) If the housing assistance payment exceeds the portion of the monthly rent due to the owner, the PHA may pay the balance of the housing assistance payment to the family. Alternatively, the PHA may pay the balance to the lender or utility company, in an amount no greater than the amount due for the month to each, respectively, subject to the lender's or utility company's willingness to accept the PHA's payment on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the lender or the utility company directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the lender or the utility company and must pay any remaining balance directly to the family.
(d)
PHA option: Single housing assistance payment to the family.
(1) If the owner of the manufactured home space agrees, the PHA may make the entire housing assistance payment to the family, and the family shall be responsible for paying the owner directly for the full amount of rent of the manufactured home space due to the owner, including owner maintenance and management charges. If the PHA exercises this option, the PHA may not make any payments directly to the lender or utility company.
(2) The PHA and owner of the manufactured home space must still execute the HAP contract, and the owner is still responsible for fulfilling all of the owner obligations under the HAP contract, including but not limited to complying with HQS and rent reasonableness requirements. The owner's acceptance of the family's monthly rent payment during the term of the HAP contract serves as the owner's certification to the reasonableness of the rent charged for the space in accordance with § 982.622(b)(4).
(3) If the family and owner agree to the single housing assistance payment, the owner is responsible for collecting the full amount of the rent and other charges under the lease directly from the family. The PHA is not responsible for any amounts owed by the family to the owner and may not pay any claim by the owner against the family.
[89 FR 38303, May 7, 2024]
§ 982.624
Manufactured home space rental: Utility allowance schedule.
The PHA must establish utility allowances for manufactured home space rental. For the first twelve months of the initial lease term only, the allowances must include a reasonable amount for utility hook-up charges payable by the family if the family actually incurs the expenses because of a move. Allowances for utility hook-up charges do not apply to a family that leases a manufactured home space in
place. Utility allowances for manufactured home space must not cover costs payable by a family to cover the digging of a well or installation of a septic system.

(1) A first-time homeowner (defined at § 982.4);
(2) A cooperative member (defined at § 982.4); or

(c)
Minimum income requirements.
(1) At commencement of monthly homeownership assistance payments for the family, or at the time of a downpayment assistance grant for the family, the family must demonstrate that the annual income, as determined by the PHA in accordance with § 5.609 of this title, of the adult family members who will own the home at commencement of homeownership assistance is not less than:
(i) In the case of a disabled family (as defined in § 5.403(b) of this title), the monthly Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit for an individual living alone (or paying his or her share of food and housing costs) multiplied by twelve; or

(2)(i) Except in the case of an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title), the PHA shall not count any welfare assistance received by the family in determining annual income under this section.
(ii) The disregard of welfare assistance income under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section only affects the determination of minimum annual income used to determine if a family initially qualifies for commencement of homeownership assistance in accordance with this section, but does not affect:
(A) The determination of income-eligibility for admission to the voucher program;
(B) Calculation of the amount of the family's total tenant payment (gross family contribution); or
(C) Calculation of the amount of homeownership assistance payments on behalf of the family.
(iii) In the case of an elderly or disabled family, the PHA shall include welfare assistance for the adult family members who will own the home in determining if the family meets the minimum income requirement.
(3) A PHA may establish a minimum income standard that is higher than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for either or both types of families. However, a family that meets the applicable HUD minimum income requirement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but not the higher standard established by the PHA shall be considered to satisfy the minimum income requirement if:
(i) The family demonstrates that it has been pre-qualified or pre-approved for financing;
(ii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing meets any PHA established requirements under § 982.632 for financing the purchase of the home (including qualifications of lenders and terms of financing); and
(iii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing amount is sufficient to purchase housing that meets HQS in the PHA's jurisdiction.

Employment requirements.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the family must demonstrate that one or more adult members of the family who will own the home at commencement of homeownership assistance:
(i) Is currently employed on a full-time basis (the term “full-time employment” means not less than an average of 30 hours per week); and
(ii) Has been continuously so employed during the year before commencement of homeownership assistance for the family.
(2) The PHA shall have discretion to determine whether and to what extent interruptions are considered to break continuity of employment during the year. The PHA may count successive employment during the year. The PHA may count self-employment in a business.
(3) The employment requirement does not apply to an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title). Furthermore, if a family, other than an elderly family or a disabled family, includes a person with disabilities, the PHA shall grant an exemption from the employment requirement if the PHA determines that an exemption is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title.
(4) A PHA may not establish an employment requirement in addition to the employment standard established by this paragraph.
(e)
Prohibition against assistance to family that has defaulted.
The PHA shall not commence homeownership assistance for a family that includes an individual who was an adult member of a family at the time when such family received homeownership assistance and defaulted on a mortgage securing debt incurred to purchase the home.

§ 982.631
Homeownership option: Home inspections, contract of sale, and PHA disapproval of seller.
(a) HQS inspection by PHA. The PHA may not commence monthly homeownership assistance payments or provide a downpayment assistance grant for the family until the PHA has inspected the unit and has determined that the unit passes HQS.
(b)
Independent inspection.
(1) The unit must also be inspected by an independent professional inspector selected by and paid by the family.
(2) The independent inspection must cover major building systems and components, including foundation and structure, housing interior and exterior, and the roofing, plumbing, electrical, and heating systems.

(4) The independent inspector must provide a copy of the inspection report both to the family and to the PHA. The PHA may not commence monthly homeownership assistance payments, or provide a downpayment assistance grant for the family, until the PHA has reviewed the inspection report of the independent inspector. Even if the unit otherwise complies with the HQS (and may qualify for assistance under the PHA's tenant-based rental voucher program), the PHA shall have discretion to disapprove the unit for assistance under the homeownership option because of information in the inspection report.
(c)
Contract of sale.
(1) Before commencement of monthly homeownership assistance payments or receipt of a downpayment assistance grant, a member or members of the family must enter into a contract of sale with the seller of the unit to be acquired by the family.

(i) The purchaser is not obligated to purchase the unit unless an environmental review has been performed and the site has received environmental approval prior to commencement of construction in accordance with 24 CFR 982.628.
(ii) The construction will not commence until the environmental review has been completed and the seller has received written notice from the PHA that environmental approval has been obtained. Conduct of the environmental review may not necessarily result in environmental approval, and environmental approval may be conditioned on the contracting parties'
agreement to modifications to the unit design or to mitigation actions.
(iii) Commencement of construction in violation of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section voids the purchase contract and renders homeownership assistance under 24 CFR part 982 unavailable for purchase of the unit.
(d)

§ 982.632
Homeownership option: Financing purchase of home; affordability of purchase.
(a) The PHA may establish requirements for financing purchase of a home to be assisted under the homeownership option. Such PHA requirements may include requirements concerning qualification of lenders (for example, prohibition of seller financing or case-by-case approval of seller financing), or concerning terms of financing (for example, a prohibition of balloon payment mortgages, establishment of a minimum homeowner equity requirement from personal resources, or provisions required to protect borrowers against high cost loans or predatory loans). A PHA may not require that families acquire financing from one or more specified lenders, thereby restricting the family's ability to secure favorable financing terms.
(b) If the purchase of the home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements.
(c) The PHA may establish requirements or other restrictions concerning debt secured by the home.
(d) The PHA may review lender qualifications and the loan terms before authorizing homeownership assistance. The PHA may disapprove proposed financing, refinancing or other debt if the PHA determines that the debt is unaffordable, or if the PHA determines that the lender or the loan terms do not meet PHA qualifications. In making this determination, the PHA may take into account other family expenses, such as child care, unreimbursed medical expenses, homeownership expenses, and other family expenses as determined by the PHA.
(e) All PHA financing or affordability requirements must be described in the PHA Administrative Plan.

member owns any title or other interest in the prior home.
(3) The PHA may establish policies that prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period. However, these policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.
(b)
Requirements for continuation of homeownership assistance.
The PHA must determine that all initial requirements listed in § 982.626 (including the environmental requirements with respect to a unit not yet under construction) have been satisfied if a family that has received homeownership assistance wants to move to such a unit with continued homeownership assistance.

Homeownership option: Pilot program for homeownership assistance for disabled families.
(a)
General.
This section implements the pilot program authorized by section 302 of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000. Under the pilot program, a PHA may provide homeownership assistance to a disabled family residing in a home purchased and owned by one or more members of the family. A PHA that administers tenant-based assistance has the choice whether to offer homeownership assistance under the pilot program (whether or not the PHA has also decided to offer the homeownership option).
(b)
Applicability of homeownership option requirements.
Except as provided in this section, all of the regulations applicable to the homeownership option (as described in §§ 982.625 through 982.641) are also applicable to the pilot program.
(c)
Initial eligibility requirements.
Before commencing homeownership assistance under the pilot program for a family, the PHA must determine that all of the following initial requirements have been satisfied:
(1) The family is a disabled family (as defined in § 5.403 of this title);
(2) The family annual income does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area;
(3) The family is not a current homeowner;
(4) The family must close on the purchase of the home during the period starting on July 23, 2001 and ending on July 23, 2004; and
(5) The family meets the initial requirements described in § 982.626; however, the following initial requirements do not apply to a family seeking to participate in the pilot program:
(i) The income eligibility requirements of § 982.201(b)(1);
(ii) The first-time homeowner requirements of § 982.627(b); and
(iii) The mortgage default requirements of § 982.627(e), if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency.
(d)
Amount and distribution of homeownership assistance payments.
(1) While the family is residing in the home, the PHA shall calculate a monthly homeownership assistance payment on behalf of the family in accordance with § 982.635 and this section.
(2) A family that is a low income family (as defined at 24 CFR 5.603(b)) as determined by HUD shall receive the full amount of the monthly homeownership assistance payment calculated under § 982.635.
(3) A family whose annual income is greater than the low income family ceiling but does not exceed 89 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 66 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.
(4) A family whose annual income is greater than the 89 percent ceiling but does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 33 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.
(5) A family whose annual income is greater than 99 percent of the median income for the area shall not receive homeownership assistance under the pilot program.
(e)
Assistance payments to lender.
The PHA must make homeownership assistance payments to a lender on behalf of the disabled family. If the assistance payment exceeds the amount due to the lender, the PHA must pay the excess directly to the family. The provisions of § 982.635(d), which permit the PHA to make monthly homeownership assistance payments directly to the family, do not apply to the pilot program.
(f)
Mortgage defaults.
The requirements of § 982.638(d) regarding mortgage defaults are applicable to the
pilot program. However, notwithstanding § 982.638(d), the PHA may, in its discretion, permit a family that has defaulted on its mortgage to move to a new unit with continued voucher homeownership assistance if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency. The requirements of §§ 982.627(a)(5) and 982.627(e) do not apply to such a family.
[66 FR 33613, June 22, 2001]
§ 982.643
Homeownership option: Downpayment assistance grants.
(a)
General.
(1) A PHA may provide a single downpayment assistance grant for a participant that has received tenant-based or project-based rental assistance in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
(2) The downpayment assistance grant must be applied toward the downpayment required in connection with the purchase of the home and/or reasonable and customary closing costs in connection with the purchase of the home.
(3) If the PHA permits the downpayment grant to be applied to closing costs, the PHA must define what fees and charges constitute reasonable and customary closing costs. However, if the purchase of a home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements, including any requirements concerning closing costs (see § 982.632(b) of this part regarding the applicability of FHA requirements to voucher homeownership assistance and § 203.27 of this title regarding allowable fees, charges and discounts for FHA-insured mortgages).
(b)
Maximum downpayment grant.
A downpayment assistance grant may not exceed twelve times the difference between the payment standard and the total tenant payment.
(c)
Payment of downpayment grant.
The downpayment assistance grant shall be paid at the closing of the family's purchase of the home.
(d)
Administrative fee.
For each downpayment assistance grant made by the PHA, HUD will pay the PHA a one-time administrative fee in accordance with § 982.152(a)(1)(iii).
(e)
Return to tenant-based assistance.
A family that has received a downpayment assistance grant may apply for and receive tenant-based rental assistance, in accordance with program requirements and PHA policies. However, the PHA may not commence tenant-based rental assistance for occupancy of the new unit so long as any member of the family owns any title or other interest in the home purchased with homeownership assistance. Further, eighteen months must have passed since the family's receipt of the downpayment assistance grant.
(f)
Implementation of downpayment assistance grants.
A PHA may not offer downpayment assistance under this paragraph until HUD publishes a notice in the
Federal Register.

§ 983.5
Description of the PBV program.
(a)
How PBV works.
(1) The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under the consolidated annual contributions contract (ACC) in 24 CFR 982.151. In the PBV program, the assistance is “attached to the structure,” which may be a multifamily building or single-family building. (See description of the difference between “project-based” and “tenant-based” rental assistance at 24 CFR 982.1(b)).
(2) The PHA enters into a HAP contract with an owner for units in existing housing or in newly constructed or rehabilitated housing.
(3) In the case of new construction or rehabilitation, the owner may develop the housing pursuant to an Agreement (§ 983.154) between the owner and the PHA. In the Agreement, the PHA agrees to execute a HAP contract after the owner completes the construction or rehabilitation of the units. Alternatively:
(i) The owner may develop the housing without an Agreement, before execution of a HAP contract, in accordance with § 983.154(f); or
(ii) In the case of rehabilitation, the owner may develop the housing or complete development activity after execution of the HAP contract, in accordance with § 983.157.
(4) During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA makes housing assistance payments to the owner for units leased and occupied by eligible families.
(b)
How PBV is funded.
If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC. This funding is used to pay housing assistance for both tenant-based and project-based voucher units. Likewise, the administrative fee funding made available to a PHA is used for the administration of both tenant-based and project-based voucher assistance.
(c)
PHA discretion to operate PBV program.
A PHA has discretion whether to operate a PBV program. HUD approval is not required, except that the PHA must notify HUD of its intent to project-base its vouchers and when the PHA executes, amends, or extends a HAP contract. The PHA must also state in its Administrative Plan that it will engage in project-basing and must amend its Administrative Plan to include all PBV-related matters over
which the PHA is exercising its policymaking discretion, including the subjects listed in § 983.10, as applicable.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36165, June 25, 2014; 89 FR 38306, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.6
Maximum number of PBV units (percentage limitation).
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a PHA may commit project-based assistance to no more than 20 percent of its authorized voucher units, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, at the time of commitment. An analysis of impact must be conducted in accordance with § 983.58, if a PHA is project-basing 50 percent or more of the PHA's authorized voucher units.
(1) A PHA is not required to reduce the number of units to which it has committed PBV assistance under an Agreement or HAP contract if the number of authorized voucher units is subsequently reduced and the number of PBV units consequently exceeds the program limitation.
(2) A PHA that was within the program limit prior to April 18, 2017, and exceeded the program limit on that date due solely to the change in how the program cap is calculated is not required to reduce the number of PBV units under an Agreement or HAP contract.
(3) In the circumstances described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the PHA may not add units to PBV HAP contracts, or enter into new Agreements or HAP contracts (except for HAP contracts resulting from Agreements entered into before the reduction of authorized units or April 18, 2017, as applicable), unless such units meet the conditions described in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.
(b)
Units subject to percentage limitation.
All PBV units which the PHA has selected (from the time of the proposal or project selection date) or which are under an Agreement or HAP contract for PBV assistance count toward the 20 percent maximum or increased cap, as applicable, except as provided in paragraph (e).
(c)
PHA determination.
The PHA is responsible for determining the amount of budget authority that is available for project-based vouchers and for ensuring that the amount of assistance that is attached to units is within the amounts available under the ACC.
(d)
Increased cap.
A PHA may project-base an additional 10 percent of its authorized voucher units at the time of commitment, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, provided the additional units meet the conditions in paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section:
(1) The units are part of a HAP contract executed on or after April 18, 2017, or are added on or after that date to any current HAP contract, including a contract entered into prior to April 18, 2017, and the units fall into at least one of the following categories:
(i) The units are specifically made available to house individuals and families that meet the definition of homeless under Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302), included in 24 CFR 578.3.
(ii) The units are specifically made available to house families that are comprised of or include a veteran. For purposes of the increased cap, a veteran means a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom.
(iii) The units provide supportive housing to persons with disabilities or to elderly persons, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403. Supportive housing means that the project makes supportive services available for all of the assisted families in the project and provides a range of services tailored to the needs of the residents occupying such housing. Such supportive services need not be provided by the owner or on site but must be reasonably available to the families receiving PBV assistance in the project. The PHA's Administrative Plan must describe the type and availability of supportive services the PHA will consider as qualifying for the 10 percent increased cap.
(iv) The units are located in an area where vouchers are difficult to use as defined in § 983.3.
(v) The units replace, on a different site, the units listed in § 983.59(b)(1) and (2) for which the PHA had authority under § 983.59 to commit PBV assistance on the original site without the
units counting toward the program cap or project cap. The units are eligible under this category only if the PHA has not committed and will not commit PBV assistance to the original site pursuant to the normally applicable exclusions of those units under § 983.59. If the PHA subsequently plans to commit PBV assistance to units on the original site, those proposed units count toward and must comply with the 20 percent maximum or increased cap of this section, as applicable, and the project cap requirements of § 983.54.
(2) The units are part of a HAP contract executed on or after December 27, 2020, or are added on or after that date to any current HAP contract, including a contract entered into prior to December 27, 2020, and meet the following requirements:
(i) The units are exclusively made available to eligible youth as described in Section 8(x)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act; and
(ii) If the units exclusively made available to eligible youth use Family Unification Program (FUP) assistance that is normally available for eligible families and youth described in Section 8(x)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act, the PHA determines and documents that the limitation of the units to youth is consistent with the local housing needs of both eligible FUP populations (families and youth) and amends its Administrative Plan to specify that FUP PBV assistance is solely for eligible youth.
(3) The PBV HAP contract must specify, and the owner must set aside, the number of units meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) and (d)(2) of this section. To qualify for the increased program cap for units meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) and (d)(2) of this section, the unit must be occupied by the type of family specified in the applicable paragraph consistent with the requirements of § 983.262.
(e)
Units previously subject to federally required rent restrictions or that received long-term rental assistance from HUD.
Units that meet the requirements of § 983.59 do not count toward the program cap. Such units are removed from the number of authorized voucher units for purposes of calculating the percentages under paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36165, June 25, 2014; 89 FR 38307, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.7
Uniform Relocation Act.
(a)
Relocation assistance for displaced person.
(1) A displaced person must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.
(2) The cost of required relocation assistance may be paid with funds provided by the owner, or with local public funds, or with funds available from other sources. Relocation costs may not be paid from voucher program funds; however, provided payment of relocation benefits is consistent with state and local law, PHAs may use their administrative fee reserve to pay for relocation assistance after all other program administrative expenses are satisfied. Use of the administrative fee reserve in this manner must be consistent with legal and regulatory requirements, including the requirements of 24 CFR 982.155 and other official HUD issuances.
(b)
Real property acquisition requirements.
The acquisition of real property for a PBV project is subject to the URA and 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.
(c)
Responsibility of PHA.
The PHA must require the owner to comply with the URA and 49 CFR part 24.
(d)
Definition of initiation of negotiations.
In computing a replacement housing payment to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the Agreement between the owner and the PHA.
§ 983.8
Equal opportunity requirements.
(a) The PBV program requires compliance with all equal opportunity requirements under federal law and regulation, including the authorities cited at 24 CFR 5.105(a).
(b) The PHA must comply with the PHA Plan civil rights and affirmatively furthering fair housing certification submitted by the PHA in accordance with 24 CFR 903.7(o).
§ 983.9
Special housing types.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) For applicability of rules on special housing types at 24 CFR part 982, subpart M, see § 983.2.
(2) In the PBV program, the PHA may not provide assistance for shared housing, manufactured home space rental, or the homeownership option.
(b)
Group homes.
A group home may include one or more group home units. A separate lease is executed for each elderly person or person with disabilities who resides in a group home.
(c)
Cooperative housing.
(1)
Applicability of part 983.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, assistance under this housing type is subject to the regulations of part 983, except the following sections of part 983, subpart F: §§ 983.256(b) and (c), 983.258 and 983.259 do not apply.
(2)
Applicability of part 982.
(i) Cooperative housing under the PBV program is also subject to the requirements of 24 CFR 982.619(b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (d), and (e).
(ii) Cooperative housing under the PBV program is not subject to the requirements of 24 CFR 982.619(a), (b)(1), (b)(4), and (c).
(3)
Assistance in cooperative housing.
Rental assistance for PBV cooperative housing where families lease cooperative housing units from cooperative members is not a special housing type and all requirements of 24 CFR 983 apply.
(4)
Rent to owner.
The regulations of 24 CFR part 983, subpart G, apply to PBV housing under paragraph (c) of this section. The reasonable rent for a cooperative unit is determined in accordance with § 983.303. For cooperative housing, the rent to owner is the monthly carrying charge under the occupancy agreement/lease between the member and the cooperative.
(5)
Other fees and charges.
Fees such as application fees, credit report fees, and transfer fees shall not be included in the rent to owner.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36165, June 25, 2014]

§ 983.51
Proposal and project selection procedures.
(a)
General procedures for submission and selection.
The PHA Administrative Plan must describe the procedures for submission and selection of PBV proposals under the methods of competitive selection in paragraph (b) of this section and selection of projects under an exception to competitive selection under paragraph (c) of this section. The description must include under what circumstances the PHA will use the selection methods described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The PHA may allow for entities that have site control to submit proposals provided the entity will be the owner prior to entering into the Agreement or HAP contract. Before selecting a PBV proposal or project, the PHA must determine that the PBV proposal or project complies with HUD program regulations and requirements, including a determination that the property is eligible housing (§§ 983.52 and 983.53), complies with the cap on the number of PBV units per project (§ 983.54), and meets the site selection standards (§ 983.55). An owner may submit, and a PHA may select, a single proposal covering multiple projects where each project consists of a single-family building, provided all projects are the same housing type (existing, rehabilitated, or newly constructed).
(b)
Methods of competitive selection.
The PHA must select PBV proposals in accordance with the selection procedures in the PHA Administrative Plan. (See paragraph (f) of this section for information about the selection of PHA-owned units.) The PHA must select PBV proposals by either of the following two methods:
(1) The PHA may issue a request for proposals (RFP), selecting a PBV proposal through a competition. The PHA's RFP may not limit proposals to a single site or impose restrictions that explicitly or practically preclude owner submission of proposals for PBV housing on different sites. A PHA may establish selection procedures in the Administrative Plan that combine or are in conjunction with other Federal, State, or local government housing assistance, community development, or supportive services competitive selection processes. If the PHA selection process is combined and administered in conjunction with another RFP process, the PHA remains responsible for complying with § 983.51. See § 983.157(a)(2) for additional requirements for an RFP for rehabilitated housing.
(2) The PHA may select, without issuing an RFP, a proposal for housing assisted under a Federal, State, or local government housing assistance, community development, or supportive services program that required competitive selection of proposals, where the proposal has been selected in accordance with such program's competitive selection requirements within three years of the PBV proposal selection date. The PHA may not select a housing assistance proposal using this method if the competition involved any consideration that the project would receive PBV assistance.
(c)
Exceptions to competitive selection.
Prior to selection under this paragraph (c), the PHA must notify the public of its intent to noncompetitively select one or more projects for PBV assistance through its 5-Year Plan.
(1) A PHA engaged in an initiative to improve, develop, or replace a public housing property or site may select for PBV assistance an existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated project in which the PHA has an ownership interest or over which the PHA has control without following a competitive process.
(i) With respect to replacement housing, the PHA does not have to replace the housing on the same site as the original public housing, but the number of contract units in the replacement project may not exceed the number of units in the original public housing project by more than a de minimis amount for this exception to apply.
(ii) The public housing properties or sites may be in the public housing inventory at the time of project selection or they may have been removed from the public housing inventory through any available legal removal tool within five years of the project selection date.
(2) A PHA may select for future PBV assistance a project currently under the public housing program, or a project that is replacing the public housing project, in which a PHA has no ownership interest, or which a PHA has no control over, without following a competitive process, provided:
(i) The public housing project is either still in the public housing inventory or had been removed from the public housing inventory through any available legal removal tool within five years of the project selection date;
(ii) The PHA that owned or owns the public housing project does not administer the HCV program;
(iii) The project selected for PBV assistance was specifically identified as replacement housing for the impacted public housing residents as part of the public housing demolition/disposition application, voluntary conversion application, or any other application process submitted to and approved by HUD to remove the public housing project from the public housing inventory; and
(iv) With respect to replacement housing, the PHA does not have to replace the housing on the same site as the original public housing, but the number of contract units in the replacement project may not exceed the number of units in the original public housing project by more than a de minimis amount for this exception to apply.
(3) A PHA may select for PBV assistance a project consisting of PHA-owned units as defined at 24 CFR 982.4 without following a competitive process.
(i) The project units must continue to meet the definition of PHA-owned for the initial two years of the HAP contract unless there is a transfer of ownership approved by HUD.
(ii) The PHA must meet any conditions with respect to selection for PBV assistance of a project consisting of PHA-owned units without following a competitive process as may be established by HUD through publication in the
Federal Register
notice after providing opportunity for public comment.
(4) A PHA may select for PBV assistance a project that underwent an eligibility event within five years of the project selection date, in which a family (or families) qualifies for enhanced voucher assistance under Section 8(t) of the Act and provides informed consent to relinquish its enhanced voucher for PBV assistance, without following a competitive process.
(d)
Public notice of PHA request for PBV proposals.
If the PHA will be selecting proposals under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, PHA procedures for selecting PBV proposals must be designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice of the opportunity to offer PBV proposals for consideration by the PHA. The public notice procedures may include publication of the public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation and other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice. The public notice of the PHA request for PBV proposals must specify the submission deadline. Detailed application and selection information must be provided at the request of interested parties.
(e)
Inspections required prior to proposal or project selection.
(1) The PHA must examine the proposed site before the proposal or project selection date to determine whether the site complies with the site selection standards in accordance with § 983.55.
(2) The PHA may execute a HAP contract for existing housing if:
(i) All proposed contract units in the project fully or substantially comply with the HQS on the proposal or project selection date, which the PHA must determine via inspection;
(ii) The project meets the environmental review requirements at § 983.56, if applicable;
(iii) The project meets the initial inspection requirements in accordance with § 983.103(c).
(f)
PHA written notice of proposal or project selection.
(1) For selection of proposals through competitive methods under paragraph (b) of this section, the PHA must give prompt written notice of proposal selection to the party that submitted a selected proposal and must also give prompt public notice of such selection. The PHA's requirement to provide public notice may be met via publication of the public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation
or other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice. The written notice of proposal selection must require the owner or party that submitted the selected proposal to provide a written response to the PHA accepting the terms and requirements stated in the notice.
(2) For selection of projects through exceptions to competition under paragraph (c) of this section, the PHA must give prompt written notice of project selection to the owner following the PHA board's resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the specific project. The written notice of project selection must require the owner of the project selected to provide a written response to the PHA accepting the terms and requirements stated in the notice.
(3) Regardless of the method of selection, if the project contains PHA-owned units that are not owned by a separate legal entity from the PHA, the PHA must provide the written notice of proposal or project selection to the responsible PHA official, and that official must certify in writing that the PHA accepts the terms and requirements stated in the notice.
(4) When an environmental review is required, if such a review has not been conducted prior to the project or proposal selection date, the PHA's written notice of project or proposal selection must state that the selection is subject to completion of a favorable environmental review and that the project or proposal may be rejected based on the results of the environmental review in accordance with 983.56(c).
(5) See § 983.153(c)(3) for additional notice requirements for newly constructed housing and rehabilitated housing.
(g)
Proposal or project selection date.
(1) The proposal selection date is the date on which the PHA provides written notice to the party that submitted the selected proposal under either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(2) For properties selected in accordance with § 983.51(c), the project selection date is the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the specific project.
(h)
PHA-owned units.
A PHA-owned unit may be assisted under the PBV program only if the HUD field office or the independent entity reviews the project selection process the PHA undertook and determines that the project was appropriately selected based on the selection procedures specified in the PHA Administrative Plan. Under no circumstance may a HAP contract be effective for any of the subsidized housing types set forth in § 983.53(a). With the exception of projects selected in accordance with § 983.51(c), the PHA's selection procedures must be designed in a manner that does not effectively eliminate the submission of proposals for non-PHA-owned units or give preferential treatment (
e.g.,
additional points) to PHA-owned units.
(i)
Public review of PHA selection decision documentation.
The PHA must make documentation available for public inspection regarding the basis for the PHA selection of a PBV proposal.
(j)
Previous participation clearance.
HUD approval of specific projects or owners is not required. For example, owner proposal selection does not require submission of form HUD-2530 (Previous Participation Certification) or other HUD previous participation clearance.
(k)
Excluded from Federal procurement.
A PHA may not commit project-based assistance to a project if the owner or any principal or interested party is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424 or is listed on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement or non-procurement programs.
[89 FR 38309, May 7, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 46020, May 28, 2024]
§ 983.52
Prohibition of assistance for ineligible units.
(a)
Ineligible unit.
A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for any of the following:
(1) Shared housing;
(2) Units on the grounds of a penal, reformatory, medical, mental, or similar public or private institution;
(3) Nursing homes or facilities providing continuous psychiatric, medical, nursing services, board and care, or intermediate care. However, the PHA may execute a HAP contract and provide PBV assistance for a dwelling unit in an assisted living facility that provides home health care services such as nursing and therapy for residents of the housing;
(4) Units that are owned or controlled by an educational institution or its affiliate and are designated for occupancy by students of the institution;
(5) Manufactured homes are ineligible only if the manufactured home is not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation or the owner does not own fee title to the real property (land) on which the manufactured home is located; and
(6) Transitional Housing.
(b)
Prohibition against assistance for owner-occupied unit.
A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for a unit occupied by an owner of the housing. A member of a cooperative who owns shares in the project assisted under the PBV program shall not be considered an owner for purposes of participation in the PBV program.
(c)
Prohibition against selecting unit occupied by an ineligible family.
Before a PHA places a specific unit under a HAP contract, the PHA must determine whether the unit is occupied and, if occupied, whether the unit's occupants are eligible for assistance in accordance with § 982.201 of this title. Additionally, for a family to be eligible for assistance in the specific unit, the unit must be appropriate for the size of the family under the PHA's subsidy standards and the total tenant payment for the family must be less than the gross rent for the unit, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP. The PHA must not enter into a HAP contract for a unit occupied by a family ineligible for participation in the PBV program.
(d)
Prohibition against assistance for units for which commencement of construction or rehabilitation occurred in violation of program requirements.
Unless a PHA has exercised the discretion at § 983.154(f), to undertake development activity without an Agreement or to execute an Agreement after construction or rehabilitation that complied with applicable requirements of § 983.153 has commenced, or at § 983.157, to undertake development activity after execution of the HAP contract, the PHA may not execute a HAP contract for units on which construction or rehabilitation commenced after the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection) and prior to the effective date of an Agreement. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve a PHA's request for an exception to this prohibition. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including the nature and extent of the construction or rehabilitation that has commenced.
(1) Units for which rehabilitation or new construction began after proposal submission or the date of board resolution but prior to the effective date of an Agreement (if applicable), as described in this paragraph (d), do not subsequently qualify as existing housing.
(2) Units that were newly constructed or rehabilitated in violation of program requirements do not qualify as existing housing.
§ 983.53
Prohibition of assistance for units in subsidized housing.
(a)
Types of subsidized housing prohibited from receiving PBV assistance.
A HAP contract must not be effective and no PBV assistance may be provided for any of the following:
(1) A public housing dwelling unit;
(2) A unit subsidized with any other form of Section 8 assistance (tenant-based or project-based);
(3) A unit subsidized with any governmental rent subsidy (a subsidy that pays all or any part of the rent);
(4) A unit subsidized with any governmental subsidy that covers all or any part of the operating costs of the housing;
(5) A unit subsidized with rental assistance payments under Section 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1490a (a Rural Housing Service Program).
However, the PHA may attach assistance for a unit subsidized with Section 515 interest reduction payments (42 U.S.C. 1485);
(6) A Section 202 project for non-elderly persons with disabilities (assistance under Section 162 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 12 U.S.C. 1701q note);
(7) Section 811 project-based supportive housing for persons with disabilities (42 U.S.C. 8013);
(8) Section 202 supportive housing for the elderly (12 U.S.C. 1701q);
(9) A unit subsidized with any form of tenant-based rental assistance (as defined at 24 CFR 982.1(b)(2)) (
e.g.,
a unit subsidized with tenant-based rental assistance under the HOME program, 42 U.S.C. 12701
et seq.
); or
(10) A unit with any other duplicative Federal, State, or local housing subsidy, as determined by HUD or by the PHA in accordance with HUD requirements. For this purpose, “housing subsidy” does not include the housing component of a welfare payment; a social security payment; or a Federal, State, or local tax concession (such as relief from local real property taxes).
(b) [Reserved]
§ 983.54
Cap on number of PBV units in each project (income-mixing requirement).
(a)
Project cap.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, a PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract if the number of assisted units in a project is more than the greater of 25 percent of the number of dwelling units (assisted and unassisted, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (c)(3)) in the project or 25 units.
(b)
Higher project cap.
A PHA may provide PBV assistance to the greater of 25 units or 40 percent of the number of dwelling units (assisted and unassisted, as adjusted as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) in the project if the project is located in an area where vouchers are difficult to use as defined in § 983.3.
(c)
Exceptions to the project cap.
(1) A project is not limited to a single exception category but may include excepted units from any of the exception categories under paragraph (2) and excluded units under paragraph (3) below.
(2) PBV units are not counted toward the project cap in the following cases:
(i) Units exclusively serving elderly families, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403;
(ii) Units exclusively made available to eligible youth described in Section 8(x)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act. If the units exclusively made available to eligible youth use Family Unification Program (FUP) assistance that is normally available for eligible families and youth, the PHA must determine that the limitation of the units to youth is consistent with the local housing needs of both eligible FUP populations (families and youth), maintain documentation to support this determination, and amend its Administrative Plan to include the limitation of these FUP PBV units to eligible youth; or
(iii) Units exclusively made available to households eligible for supportive services available to the residents of the project assisted with PBV assistance. The project must make supportive services available to all PBV-assisted families in the project, but the family may not be required to participate in the services as a condition of living in the excepted unit. Such supportive services need not be provided by the owner or on-site but must be reasonably available to the families receiving PBV assistance in the project and designed to help the families in the project achieve self-sufficiency or live in the community as independently as possible. The supportive services must be made available to the family within a reasonable time as defined by the PHA, but not to exceed 120 calendar days from the family's request. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the types of services offered to families that will enable the units to qualify under the exception and the extent to which such services will be provided (
e.g.,
length of time services will be provided to a family, frequency of services, and depth of services), and the reasonable time by which such services must be made available to the family, not to exceed 120 calendar days. A PHA that manages an FSS program may offer FSS to meet the exception. The PHA may also make the supportive
services used in connection with the FSS program available to non-FSS PBV families at the project.
(3) Units that are excluded under § 983.59 do not count toward the project cap. Such units are removed from the number of dwelling units for purposes of calculating the percentages under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(4)(i) The PBV HAP contract must specify, and the owner must set aside, the number of excepted units made available for occupancy by families who qualify for the exception.
(ii) For a unit to be considered excepted it must be occupied by a family who qualifies for the exception.
(d)
HAP contracts already in effect.
(1) In general, HAP contracts in effect prior to April 18, 2017, when the exception at paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section came into effect and a prior exception for disabled families was removed, or prior to December 27, 2020, when the exception at paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section came into effect, are governed by those HAP contracts' terms concerning the number and type of excepted units in a project. The owner must continue to designate the same number of contract units and assist the same number and type of excepted units as provided under the HAP contract during the remaining term of the HAP contract and any extension.
(2) The owner and the PHA may mutually agree to change the requirements for excepted units under the HAP contract to comply with the excepted unit requirements in subsection (c) of this section. However, any change to the HAP contract may only be made if the change does not jeopardize an assisted family's eligibility for continued assistance at the project.
(e)
PHA determination.
The PHA determines the number of units in the project for which the PHA will provide project-based assistance, including whether and how many units will be excepted, subject to the provisions of this section. See § 983.262 for occupancy requirements of excepted units.
(f)
HUD monitoring.
HUD may establish additional monitoring and oversight requirements for PBV projects in which more than 40 percent of the dwelling units are assisted under a PBV HAP contract through a
Federal Register
Notice, subject to public comment.
§ 983.55
Site selection standards.
(a)
Applicability.
The site selection requirements in paragraph (d) of this section apply only to site selection for existing housing and rehabilitated PBV housing. The site selection requirements in paragraph (e) of this section apply only to site selection for newly constructed PBV housing. Other provisions of this section apply to selection of a site for any form of PBV housing, including existing housing, newly constructed housing, and rehabilitated housing.
(b)
Compliance with PBV goals, civil rights requirements, and site and neighborhood standards.
The PHA may not select a project or proposal for existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated PBV housing on a site or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract for units on the site, unless the PHA has determined that:
(1) Project-based assistance for housing at the selected site is consistent with the goal of deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities. The standard for deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities must be consistent with the PHA Plan under 24 CFR part 903 and the PHA Administrative Plan. In developing the standards to apply in determining whether a proposed PBV development will be selected, a PHA must consider the following:
(i) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is in a HUD-designated Enterprise Zone, Economic Community, or Renewal Community;
(ii) Whether a PBV development will be located in a census tract where the concentration of assisted units will be or has decreased as a result of public housing demolition;
(iii) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is undergoing significant revitalization;
(iv) Whether State, local, or Federal dollars have been invested in the area that has assisted in the achievement of the statutory requirement;
(v) Whether new market rate units are being developed in the same census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located and the likelihood that such market rate units will positively impact the poverty rate in the area;
(vi) If the poverty rate in the area where the proposed PBV development will be located is greater than 20 percent, the PHA must consider whether in the past five years there has been an overall decline in the poverty rate;
(vii) Whether there are meaningful opportunities for educational and economic advancement in the census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located.
(2) The site is suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d(4)) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601-3629) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100 through 199; Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 652) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107. The site must also be suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations (28 CFR part 35), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including meeting the Section 504 site selection requirements described in 24 CFR 8.4(b)(5).
(3) The site and neighborhood is reasonably free from disturbing noises and reverberations and other dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the occupants. The site and neighborhood may not be subject to serious adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, that could affect the health or safety of the project occupants, such as dangerous walks or steps; contamination; instability; flooding, poor drainage, septic tank back-ups or sewage hazards; mudslides; abnormal air pollution, smoke or dust; excessive noise, vibration or vehicular traffic; excessive accumulations of trash; vermin or rodent infestation; or fire hazards.
(c)
PHA PBV site selection policy.
(1) The PHA Administrative Plan must establish the PHA's policy for selection of PBV sites in accordance with this section.
(2) The site selection policy must explain how the PHA's site selection procedures promote the PBV goals.
(3) The PHA must select PBV sites in accordance with the PHA's site selection policy in the PHA Administrative Plan.
(d)
Existing and rehabilitated housing site and neighborhood standards.
A site for existing or rehabilitated housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards. The site must:
(1) Be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities and streets must be available to service the site. (The existence of a private disposal system and private sanitary water supply for the site, approved in accordance with law, may be considered adequate utilities.)
(2) Promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.
(3) Be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.
(4) Be so located that travel time and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers is not excessive. While it is important that housing for the elderly not be totally isolated from employment opportunities, this requirement need not be adhered to rigidly for such projects.
(e)
New construction site and neighborhood standards.
A site for newly constructed housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards:
(1) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities (water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets must be available to service the site.
(2) The site must not be located in an area of minority concentration, except as permitted under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and must not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to non-minority residents in the area.
(3) A project may be located in an area of minority concentration only if:
(i) Sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority families in the income range to be served by the proposed project outside areas of minority concentration (see paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) through (v) of this section for further guidance on this criterion); or
(ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot be met in that housing market area (see paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section for further guidance on this criterion).
(iii) As used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, “sufficient” does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year, that, over a period of several years, will approach an appropriate balance of housing choices within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for low-income minority families and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.
(iv) Units may be considered “comparable opportunities,” as used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, if they have the same household type (elderly, disabled, family, large family) and tenure type (owner/renter); require approximately the same tenant contribution towards rent; serve the same income group; are located in the same housing market; and are in standard condition.
(v) Application of this sufficient, comparable opportunities standard involves assessing the overall impact of HUD-assisted housing on the availability of housing choices for low-income minority families in and outside areas of minority concentration, and must take into account the extent to which the following factors are present, along with other factors relevant to housing choice:
(A) A significant number of assisted housing units are available outside areas of minority concentration.
(B) There is significant integration of assisted housing projects constructed or rehabilitated in the past 10 years, relative to the racial mix of the eligible population.
(C) There are racially integrated neighborhoods in the locality.
(D) Programs are operated by the locality to assist minority families that wish to find housing outside areas of minority concentration.
(E) Minority families have benefited from local activities (
e.g.,
acquisition and write-down of sites, tax relief programs for homeowners, acquisitions of units for use as assisted housing units) undertaken to expand choice for minority families outside of areas of minority concentration.
(F) A significant proportion of minority households has been successful in finding units in non-minority areas under the tenant-based assistance programs.
(G) Comparable housing opportunities have been made available outside areas of minority concentration through other programs.
(vi) Application of the “overriding housing needs” criterion, for example, permits approval of sites that are an integral part of an overall local strategy for the preservation or restoration of the immediate neighborhood and of sites in a neighborhood experiencing significant private investment that is demonstrably improving the economic character of the area (a “revitalizing area”). An “overriding housing need,” however, may not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable, if the only reason the need cannot otherwise be feasibly met is that discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial
status, or disability renders sites outside areas of minority concentration unavailable or if the use of this standard in recent years has had the effect of circumventing the obligation to provide housing choice.
(4) The site must promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.
(5) The neighborhood must not be one that is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other undesirable conditions predominate, unless there is actively in progress a concerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions.
(6) The housing must be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.
(7) Except for housing designed for elderly persons, travel time and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers, must not be excessive.
§ 983.56
Environmental review.
(a)
HUD environmental regulations.
(1) HUD environmental regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58 apply to activities under the PBV program, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) For projects or proposals that were selected in accordance with the site selection standards at § 983.55 in effect on or after June 6, 2024, no environmental review is required to be undertaken before entering into a HAP contract for existing housing, except to the extent a Federal environmental review is required by law or regulation relating to funding other than PBV housing assistance payments.
(b)
Who performs the environmental review?
Under 24 CFR part 58, the unit of general local government within which the project is located that exercises land use responsibility, the county, or the State (the “responsible entity” or “RE”), is responsible for the Federal environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) and related applicable Federal laws and authorities in accordance with 24 CFR 58.5 and 58.6. If a PHA objects in writing to having the RE perform the Federal environmental review, or if the RE declines to perform it, then HUD may perform the review itself (24 CFR 58.11). 24 CFR part 50 governs HUD performance of the review.
(c)
Notice of applicability.
When an environmental review is required, if such a review has not been conducted prior to the proposal or project selection date, then the PHA's written notice of proposal or project selection must state that the selection is subject to completion of a favorable environmental review and that the project may be rejected based on the results of the environmental review.
(d)
Environmental review limitations.
When an environmental review is required, a PHA may not execute an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner, and the PHA, the owner, and its contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish, or construct real property or commit or expend program or local funds for these activities, until one of the following occurs:

The analysis performed by the PHA must be available as part of the public record.
§ 983.59
Units excluded from program cap and project cap.
(a)
General.
For HAP contracts entered into on or after April 18, 2017, the PHA may commit project-based assistance to units that meet the requirements for exclusion in paragraph (b) of this section. Such units do not count toward the program cap or project cap described in §§ 983.6 and 983.54, respectively.
(b)
Requirements for exclusion of existing or rehabilitated units.
Excluded units must, in the five years prior to the request for proposals (RFP) or the proposal or project selection date in the case of selection without RFP, fall into one of the following categories provided that the units are removed from all categories prior to the effective date of the HAP contract:
(1) The units have received one of the following forms of HUD assistance:
(i) Public Housing Capital or Operating Funds (Section 9 of the 1937 Act);

notice subject to public comment.
(c)
Replacement units.
Newly constructed units developed under the PBV program may be excluded from the program cap and project cap provided the primary purpose of the newly constructed units is or was to replace units that meet the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The newly constructed unit must be located on the same site as the unit it is replacing; however, an expansion of or modification to the prior project's site boundaries as a result of the design of the newly constructed project is acceptable as long as a majority of the replacement units are built back on the site of the original project and any replacement units that are not located on the existing site are part of a project that shares a common border with, are across a public right of way from, or touch that site. In addition, in order for the replacement units to be excluded from the program and project caps, one of the following must be true:
(1) Former residents of the original project must be provided with a selection preference that provides the residents with the right of first occupancy at the PBV newly constructed project when it is ready for occupancy.
(2) Prior to the demolition of the original project, the PBV newly constructed project must have been identified as replacement housing for that original project as part of a documented plan for the redevelopment of the site.
(d)
Unit size configuration and number of units for newly constructed and rehabilitated projects.
The unit size configuration of the PBV newly constructed or rehabilitated project may differ from the unit size configuration of the original project that the PBV units are replacing. In addition, the total number of PBV-assisted units may differ from the number of units in the original project. However, only the total number of units in the original project are excluded from the program cap and the project cap. Units that exceed the total number of covered units in the original project are subject to the program cap and the project cap.
(e)
Inapplicability of other program and project cap exceptions.
The 10 percent exception under § 983.6 and the project cap exception under § 983.54(c)(2) are inapplicable to excluded units under this section.

# Subpart C—Dwelling Units
§ 983.101
Housing quality standards.
(a)
HQS applicability.
As defined in § 983.3, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 of this title for housing assisted under the PBV program, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3).
(b)
Requirements for special housing types.
For special housing types assisted under the PBV program, HQS applies to the PBV program except as specified in 24 CFR part 982, subpart M. Provisions contained within 24 CFR part 982 that are inapplicable to the PBV program pursuant to § 983.2 are also inapplicable to special housing types under the PBV program.
(c)
Lead-based paint requirements.
The Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R, apply to the PBV program.
(d)

Parts 982 and 983 of this chapter do not create any right of the family or any party, other than HUD or the PHA, to require enforcement of the HQS requirements or to assert any claim against HUD or the PHA for damages, injunction, or other relief for alleged failure to enforce the HQS.
(e)
Additional PHA quality and design requirements.
This section establishes the minimum federal housing quality standards for PBV housing. However, the PHA may elect to establish additional requirements for quality, architecture, or design of PBV housing.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36167, June 25, 2014; 88 FR 30504, May 11, 2023; 89 FR 38315, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.102
Housing accessibility for persons with disabilities.
(a)
Program accessibility.
The housing must comply with program accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8. The PHA shall ensure that the percentage of accessible dwelling units complies with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as implemented by HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 8, subpart C.
(b)
Design and construction.
Housing first occupied after March 13, 1991, must comply with design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205, as applicable.
§ 983.103
Inspecting units.
(a)
Pre-selection inspection.
If the units to be assisted already exist, the PHA must inspect all units before the proposal or project selection date and must determine if the project meets the definition of existing housing. If the project is existing housing, the PHA may not execute the HAP contract until all units meet the initial inspection requirements in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Initial inspection of newly constructed and rehabilitated projects and units that underwent substantial improvement to be added to a HAP contract.
Following completion of work pursuant to § 983.155, the PHA must complete the following inspection(s), as applicable in accordance with § 983.156:
(1) For rehabilitated housing that is developed prior to the HAP contract term or newly constructed housing, the PHA must inspect each proposed newly constructed and rehabilitated PBV unit before execution of the HAP contract. Each proposed PBV unit must fully comply with HQS prior to HAP contract execution.
(2) For rehabilitated housing that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the PHA must conduct unit inspections in accordance with the requirements of § 983.157.
(3) Inspect each unit that underwent substantial improvement pursuant to §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212. Each PBV unit that underwent substantial improvement must fully comply with HQS prior to the PHA adding the unit to the HAP contract, returning the unit temporarily removed to the HAP contract, allowing re-occupancy of the unit, and resuming housing assistance payments, as applicable.
(c)
Initial inspection requirements for existing housing
—(1)
In general.
In accordance with this paragraph, the PHA may adopt in its Administrative Plan the non-life-threatening deficiencies option or the alternative inspection option, or both, for initial inspections of existing housing. If the PHA has not adopted the initial inspection non-life-
threatening deficiency option (NLT option) or the alternative inspection option for the project, the PHA must inspect and determine that all of the proposed PBV units fully comply with HQS before entering the HAP contract. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan the amount of time that may elapse between the initial inspection of existing housing and execution of a HAP contract for that unit.
(2)
Initial inspection—NLT option.
(i) A PHA may execute the HAP contract and begin making assistance payments for all of the assisted units, including units that failed the initial HQS inspection, provided that no units have life-threatening deficiencies and if the owner agrees to the NLT option. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option and the alternative inspections option under paragraph (c)(3) of this section for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(ii) After completing the inspections and determining there are no life-threatening deficiencies, for any unit with non-life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA must provide both the owner and the family (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list being offered that unit) a list of the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and an explanation of the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance if the owner does not complete the repairs within 30 days. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will remove the unit from the HAP contract, and the family will be issued a voucher to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. If the PHA's Administrative Plan provides that the PHA will terminate the PBV HAP contract if the owner fails to correct deficiencies in any unit in the project within the cure period, the PHA must also provide the notice described above to families referred to units without any deficiencies. The family referred from the waiting list may choose to decline the unit and remain on the waiting list. An eligible in-place family may decline the unit, and the PHA must issue the family a tenant-based voucher to move from the unit in that circumstance.
(iii) If the family decides to lease the unit, the family enters into the assisted lease with the owner. The PHA commences making assistance payments to the owner.
(iv) The owner must correct the deficiencies within 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments for the unit until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(v) The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan the maximum amount of time it will withhold payments before abating payments and the number of days after which the PHA will either terminate the PBV HAP contract or remove the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b).
(vi) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of a family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During any period the assistance is abated under the NLT option, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner and the PHA, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-based assistance. In the case of an in-place family, the family may also choose to terminate the tenancy during the withholding period following the 30-day cure period, and the PHA must offer the family either another assisted unit in the PBV project that fully complies with HQS or tenant-based assistance.
(3)
Initial inspection—alternative inspection option.
The PHA may adopt the alternative inspection option for initial inspections of existing housing, subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).
(i) After the PHA determines the project meets the definition of existing housing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may execute the HAP contract for the project if the project has been inspected in the previous 24 months using an alternative inspection that meets the requirements of 24 CFR 982.406, as opposed to re-inspecting the project to make sure all units fully comply with HQS before executing the HAP contract, if the owner agrees to the use of the alternative inspection option. If the PHA has established and the unit is covered by both the NLT option under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the alternative inspection option for the initial HQS inspection, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(ii) The PHA notifies all families (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list being offered a contract unit) that will occupy a contract unit before the PHA conducts the HQS inspection that the alternative inspection option is in effect for the project. The PHA must provide each family with the PHA list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening as part of this notification. A family on the waiting list may decline to accept an offered unit due to unit conditions and retain its place on the PBV waiting list.
(iii) The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days of the proposal or project selection date. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA prior to the PHA's inspection, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under paragraph (f) of this section or within 30 days of the effective date of the HAP contract, whichever time period ends first.
(iv) The PHA may not commence housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected all the units under the HAP contract and determined they meet HQS.
(v) If the PHA inspection finds that any contract unit contains HQS deficiencies, the PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until all the deficiencies have been corrected in all contract units. If a deficiency is life-threatening, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification from the PHA. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days (or any PHA-approved extension) of notification from the PHA. If the owner corrects the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA makes the housing assistance payments retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later.
(vi) The PHA establishes in the Administrative Plan the maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner does not correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments and the date by which the PHA will either remove the unit from the HAP contract or terminate the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title.
(vii) If the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable time periods, the PHA must abate the payments for the non-compliant units, while continuing to withhold payments for the HQS compliant units until all the units meet HQS or the unit removal or contract termination occurs. If the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(viii) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of a family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During the abatement period, a family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-
based assistance. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title.
(4)
Initial inspection—use of both the NLT and alternative options.
The PHA may adopt both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option for initial inspections of existing housing, subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).
(i) If the owner agrees to both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option, then the PHA notifies all families (any eligible in-place family (§ 983.251(d)) or any family referred from the PBV waiting list that will occupy the unit before the PHA conducts the HQS inspection) that both the NLT option and the alternative inspection option will be used for the family's unit. As part of this notification, the PHA must provide the family with the PHA's list of HQS deficiencies that are considered life-threatening. A family on the waiting list may decline to move into a unit due to unit conditions and retain its place on the PBV waiting list. Following inspection (see paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section), the PHA must provide any family referred from the PBV waiting list that will occupy a unit with non-life-threatening deficiencies a list of the non-life-threatening deficiencies identified by the initial HQS inspection and an explanation of the maximum amount of time the PHA will withhold HAP before abating assistance if the owner does not complete the repairs within 30 days. The PHA must also inform the family that if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to make the repairs within the cure period, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract, the PHA will remove the unit from the HAP contract, and the family will be issued a voucher to move to another unit in order to receive voucher assistance. The family referred from the waiting list may choose to decline the unit and remain on the PBV waiting list.
(ii) The PHA executes the HAP contract with the owner on the basis of the alternative inspection. The PHA must conduct an HQS inspection within 30 days after the proposal or project selection date. If the family reports a deficiency to the PHA during this interim period, the PHA must inspect the unit within the time period required under paragraph (f) of this section or within 30 days of the proposal or project selection date, whichever time period ends first.
(iii) The PHA may not make housing assistance payments to the owner until the PHA has inspected all the assisted units.
(iv) If none of the units have any life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA commences payments and makes retroactive payments to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later, for all the assisted units. For any unit that failed the PHA's HQS inspection but has no life-threatening deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiencies within no more than 30 days from the effective date of the HAP contract. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the 30-day cure period, the PHA must withhold the housing assistance payments for that unit until the owner makes the repairs and the PHA verifies the correction. Once the unit is in compliance with HQS, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(v) If any units have life-threatening deficiencies, the PHA may not commence making housing assistance payments to the owner for any units until all the HQS deficiencies (life-threatening and non-life-threatening) have been corrected. The PHA must not refer families from the PBV waiting list to occupy units with life-threatening deficiencies. The owner must correct all life-threatening deficiencies within no more than 24 hours. For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within no more than 30 calendar days (or any PHA-approved extension). If the owner corrects all of the deficiencies within the required cure period, the PHA must make the housing assistance payments
retroactive to the effective date of the HAP contract or the PBV lease effective dates, whichever is later. If the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable time periods, the PHA must abate the payments for the non-compliant units, while continuing to withhold payments for the HQS compliant units until all the units meet HQS or the unit removal or contract termination occurs. If the deficiencies are corrected, the PHA must use the withheld housing assistance payments to make payments for the period that payments were withheld.
(vi) The owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family because of the withholding or abatement of assistance payments. During the period the assistance is abated, a family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner, and the PHA must provide the family tenant-based assistance. If the PHA terminates the PBV HAP contract or removes the unit from the HAP contract as a result of the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, the PHA must provide any affected family with tenant-based assistance as provided in § 983.206(b) of this title. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan:
(A) The maximum amount of time it will withhold payments if the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the required cure period before abating payments; and
(B) The number of days after which the PHA will terminate the HAP contract or remove the unit from the HAP contract for the owner's failure to correct the deficiencies, which may not exceed 180 days from the effective date of the HAP contract.
(d)
Turnover inspections.
Before providing assistance to a new family in a contract unit, the PHA must inspect the unit. The PHA must not provide assistance on behalf of a family for a unit that fails to comply fully with HQS.
(e)
Periodic inspections.
(1) At least biennially during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA must inspect a random sample, consisting of at least 20 percent of the contract units in each building, to determine if the contract units and the premises are maintained in accordance with HQS. Turnover inspections pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section are not counted toward meeting this inspection requirement. Instead of biennially, a small rural PHA, as defined in § 902.101 of this title, must inspect the random sample of units in accordance with this paragraph at least once every three years. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan the frequency of periodic inspections. This requirement applies in the case of a HAP contract that is undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157; however, if the periodic inspection occurs during the period of development activity covered by the rider and fewer than 20 percent of contract units in each building are designated in the rider as available for occupancy, the PHA is only required to inspect the units in that building that are designated as available for occupancy.
(2) If more than 20 percent of the sample of inspected contract units in a building fail the initial inspection, then the PHA must reinspect 100 percent of the contract units in the building.
(3) A PHA may also use alternative inspections to meet the requirements for periodic inspections in this paragraph (e), subject to the procedures and requirements specified in 24 CFR 982.406(b), (c), (d), and (g).
(f)
Other inspections.
(1)
Interim inspections:
When a participant family or government official notifies the PHA of a potential deficiency, the following conditions apply:
(i)
Life-threatening.
If the reported deficiency is life-threatening, the PHA must, within 24 hours, both inspect the housing unit and notify the owner if the life-threatening deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 24 hours of PHA notification.
(ii)
Non-life-threatening.
If the reported deficiency is non-life-threatening, the PHA must, within 15 days, both inspect the unit and notify the owner if the deficiency is confirmed. The owner must then make the repairs within 30 days of the notification from the PHA or within any PHA-approved extension.
(iii)
Extraordinary circumstances.
In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a presidentially declared disaster area,
HUD may approve an exception of the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.
(2)
Follow-up inspections:
The PHA must conduct follow-up inspections needed to determine if the owner (or, if applicable, the family) has corrected an HQS violation, except where the PHA is using a verification method as described in paragraph (h) of this section, and must conduct inspections to determine the basis for exercise of contractual and other remedies for owner or family violation of the HQS. (Family HQS obligations are specified in 24 CFR 982.404(b).)
(3)
Supervisory quality control inspections:
In conducting PHA supervisory quality control HQS inspections, the PHA should include a representative sample of both tenant-based and project-based units.
(g)
Inspecting PHA-owned units.
(1) In the case of PHA-owned units, the inspections required under this section must be performed by an independent entity designated in accordance with § 983.57, rather than by the PHA.
(2) The independent entity must furnish a copy of each inspection report to the PHA.
(3) The PHA must take all necessary actions in response to inspection reports from the independent entity, including exercise of contractual remedies for violation of the HAP contract by the PHA owner.
(h)
Verification methods.
When a PHA must verify correction of a deficiency, the PHA may use verification methods other than another on-site inspection. The PHA may establish different verification methods for initial and subsequent inspections or for different HQS deficiencies, which must be detailed in its Administrative Plan. Upon either an inspection for initial occupancy or a reinspection, the PHA may accept photographic evidence or other reliable evidence from the owner to verify that a deficiency has been corrected.
(i)
Projects with government financing.
In the case of a PBV project financed under a Federal, State, or local housing program that is subject to an alternative inspection, the PHA may rely upon inspections conducted at least triennially to demonstrate compliance with the alternative inspection option under paragraph (c) of this section or the periodic inspection requirement of paragraph (e) of this section, in accordance with its policy established in the PHA Administrative Plan.

# Subpart D—Requirements for Rehabilitated and Newly Constructed Units

# Source:
89 FR 38318, May 7, 2024, unless otherwise noted.
§ 983.151
Applicability.
This subpart applies to development activity, as defined in § 983.3, under the PBV program.
§ 983.152
Nature of development activity.
(a)
Purpose of development activity.
An owner may undertake development activity, as defined at § 983.3, for the purpose of:
(1) Placing a newly constructed or rehabilitated project under a HAP contract; or
(2) For a rehabilitated project that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution, completing the requirements of the rider in accordance with § 983.157.
(b)
Development requirements.
Development activity must comply with the requirements of §§ 983.153 through 983.157.
§ 983.153
Development requirements.
(a)
Environmental review requirements.
The development activity must comply with any applicable environmental review requirements at § 983.56.
(b)
Subsidy layering review.
(1) The PHA may provide PBV assistance only in accordance with the HUD subsidy layering regulations (24 CFR 4.13) and other requirements. A subsidy layering review is required when an owner undertakes development activity and housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program is combined with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as
tax concessions or tax credits. The subsidy layering review is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for the housing by combining (layering) housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits.
(2) When a subsidy layering review is required, it must occur before a PHA attaches assistance to a project. Specifically, the PHA may not execute an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner until HUD or a housing credit agency approved by HUD has conducted any required subsidy layering review and determined that the PBV assistance is in accordance with HUD subsidy layering requirements.
(3) A further subsidy layering review is not required if HUD's designee has conducted a review in accordance with HUD's PBV subsidy layering review guidelines and that review included a review of PBV assistance.
(4) The owner must disclose to the PHA any change to the information provided for purposes of the subsidy layering review, including the amount of assistance or number of units to be developed, that occurs after the subsidy layering review has been conducted and before all contract units are placed under the HAP contract, in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review may be required to determine if such a change would result in excess public assistance to the project, as required by HUD through notification in the
Federal Register
.
(5) The HAP contract must contain the owner's certification that the project has not received and will not receive (before or during the term of the HAP contract) any public assistance for acquisition, development, or operation of the housing other than assistance disclosed in the subsidy layering review in accordance with HUD requirements, unless the owner discloses additional assistance in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review is required for newly constructed or rehabilitated housing under a HAP contract that receives additional assistance, as described in § 983.11(d).
(6) Existing housing is exempt from subsidy layering requirements.
(c)
Labor standards.
(1) Labor standards as described in paragraphs (c)(2) of this section apply to development activity. When the PHA exercises its discretion at §§ 983.154(f) or 983.157(a) to allow the owner to conduct some or all development activity while the proposed PBV units are not under an Agreement or HAP contract, the applicable parties must comply with the labor standards in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection).
(2) In the case of development involving nine or more contract units (whether or not completed in stages):
(i) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must pay Davis-Bacon wages to laborers and mechanics employed in development of the housing; and
(ii) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must comply with the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5, and other applicable Federal labor relations laws and regulations. The PHA must monitor compliance with labor standards.
(3) For any project to which labor standards apply, the PHA's written notice to the party that submitted the selected proposal or board resolution approving project-basing of assistance at the specific project, as applicable per § 983.51(f), must state that any construction contracts must incorporate a Davis-Bacon contract clause and the current applicable prevailing wage determination.
(d)
Equal employment opportunity.
Development activity is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).
(e)
Accessibility.
As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to development activity. A description of any required work item resulting from these requirements must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(6) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(1).
(f)
Broadband infrastructure.
(1) Any development activity that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the development activity while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:
(i) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or
(iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
(2) A description of any required work item resulting from this requirement must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(7) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(2).
(g)
Eligibility to participate in Federal programs and activities.
(1) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in development activity or the rehabilitation of units subject to a HAP contract. Both the Agreement (if applicable) and the HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.
(2) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the Agreement (if applicable), the HAP contract, or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.
§ 983.154
Development agreement.
(a)

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 38293, May 7, 2024, § 982.4 was amended, effective date delayed indefinitely.
§ 983.155
Completion of work.
(a)
General requirement.
The owner must submit evidence and certify to the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan, that development activity under § 983.152 or substantial improvement under §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212 has been completed, and that all such work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements. The PHA must review the evidence to determine whether the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements.
(b)
PHA-owned units.
In the case of PHA-owned units, the owner must submit evidence and certify to the independent entity (see § 983.57(b)(3)), in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan, that development activity under § 983.152 or substantial improvement under §§ 983.207(d) or 983.212 has been completed, and that all such work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements. The independent entity must review the evidence to determine whether the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements.
§ 983.156
PHA acceptance of completed units.
(a)
Inspection of units.
After the PHA has received all required evidence of completion and the owner's certification that all work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements, the PHA must inspect the completed units to determine whether they comply with HUD's HQS (see § 983.103(b)) and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA.
(b)
Execution or amendment of the HAP contract.
If the PHA determines that the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements at § 983.155 and the completed units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section, then the PHA must:
(1) For units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;
(2) For rehabilitated housing projects for which development activity has commenced prior to HAP contract execution, but which will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution under § 983.157(b), submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;
(3) For development activity conducted after HAP contract execution, amend the HAP contract rider to designate the completed units as available for occupancy (§ 983.157(f)(1)(ii)) or, if the owner has completed all development activity as provided in the rider, amend the HAP contract to terminate the rider (§ 983.157(d)); or
(4) For units that underwent substantial improvement in order to be added to the HAP contract, amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (§ 983.207(d)).
(c)
Staged completion of contract units.
Contract units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157 may be placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates. In such a case, the PHA must determine separately for each stage whether the development activity was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements per § 983.155 and that the units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section. If the first stage is determined compliant, then the PHA must submit the HAP
contract for execution by the owner and must execute the HAP contract for PBV rehabilitated housing and newly constructed housing projects. As each subsequent stage is determined compliant, the PHA and owner must amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (see § 983.207(g)).
(d)
PHA-owned units.
The independent entity must perform the inspection required in paragraph (a) of this section and make the determination(s) required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section in the case of PHA-owned units (see § 983.57(b)(3)).
§ 983.157
Rehabilitated housing: option for development activity after HAP contract execution.
(a)
PHA discretion.
(1) The PHA may allow an owner of a rehabilitated housing project to conduct some or all of the development activity during the term of the HAP contract, as provided in this section. Under this option, the PHA and owner place all proposed PBV units under the HAP contract at the time provided in paragraph (c) of this section and before the owner completes development activity. During the period of development activity, the PHA makes assistance payments to the owner for the contract units that are occupied and meet HQS.
(2) In its Administrative Plan, the PHA must explain the circumstances (if any) under which the PHA will enter a PBV HAP contract for rehabilitated housing that allows for development activity on contract units. The Administrative Plan may provide for execution of HAP contracts in accordance with this section prior to commencement of development activity, following commencement of development activity, or both. When the PHA uses the competitive selection method at § 983.51(b)(1), the PHA's policy must be disclosed in the request for proposals.
(b)
Projects that have commenced rehabilitation.
If the PHA allows for execution of a HAP contract following commencement of development activity, the following requirements apply to the development activity that occurs before HAP contract execution:
(1) For rehabilitation undertaken under an Agreement, the development activity must have complied with the Agreement executed pursuant to § 983.154, including completion of any work items and completion and acceptance of any units which were to be completed under the Agreement under §§ 983.155 and 983.156; or
(2) For rehabilitation undertaken without an Agreement pursuant to § 983.154(f):
(i) The owner of the project must be able to document its compliance with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection); and
(ii) For housing subject to competitive selection, the PHA must confirm prior to the proposal selection date that the owner has complied with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of proposal submission. For housing excepted from competitive selection, the PHA must confirm prior to executing the HAP contract that the owner has complied with all applicable requirements of § 983.153 from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project.
(c)
Timing of HAP contract execution.
The PHA may execute the HAP contract for a project covered by this section after all of the following have occurred:
(1) The applicable requirement of § 983.56(d) (environmental review) has been met;
(2) If applicable, the subsidy layering review has been completed, in accordance with § 983.153(b)(2);
(3) If applicable, the PHA has determined that development activity that has commenced met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;
(4) The PHA has conducted an inspection (see § 983.103(b)(2)) of all units that the owner proposes to make available for occupancy by an assisted family at the beginning of the HAP contract term and the PHA has determined that at least one of those proposed contract units, including items and components within the primary and secondary means of egress, common features, and systems equipment as described by 24
CFR 5.703(a)(2), fully complies with HQS. The PHA may make the determination of compliance with HQS regardless of whether the HQS-compliant unit is expected to undergo rehabilitation. The owner may make repairs to correct HQS deficiencies identified during the PHA inspection as part of the development activity that occurs prior to HAP contract execution (see paragraph (b) of this section) to make the unit available for occupancy at the beginning of the HAP contract term. The PHA must establish in its Administrative Plan the amount of time that may elapse between the inspection and the execution of the HAP contract; and
(5) Occupants (if any) of proposed PBV units that were not inspected pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section or that do not fully comply with HQS have moved and such units are vacant. These units must be identified as unavailable for occupancy in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. Any inspected unit that does not fully comply with HQS must undergo development activity, followed by inspection under § 983.156(a), prior to being designated for occupancy under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
(6) Occupants (if any) who do not accept PBV assistance have moved and such units are vacant.
(7) The PHA may decline to place proposed PBV units that do not meet the criteria in paragraphs (c)(5) or (6) of this section on the HAP contract in order to execute the HAP contract before the units have been vacated. The PHA may add the units to the HAP contract once the units are vacant in accordance with § 983.207, except that the inspection requirement of § 983.207 does not apply if the unit will initially be categorized as unavailable for occupancy as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
(d)
HAP contract requirements.
The PHA and owner must execute the HAP contract (see § 983.204(c)) with a rider to the HAP contract that will govern development activity occurring during the term of the HAP contract. The contents of the HAP contract apply and are supplemented by the additional terms and conditions provided in the rider during the period the rider is in effect. When executing the HAP contract and rider, the PHA and owner complete the information in the HAP contract as provided in § 983.203 in addition to the information in the rider as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The rider must be in the form required by HUD (see 24 CFR 982.162(b)). In the rider, the owner agrees to develop the contract units to comply with HQS, and the PHA agrees that, upon timely completion of such development activity in accordance with the terms of the rider, the rider will terminate and the HAP contract will remain in effect. The PHA determination that development activity has been completed and the rider may be terminated is made when all work has been completed in accordance with the applicable requirements at § 983.155 and all contract units fully comply with HQS, as provided in § 983.156(b)(3).
(e)
Contents of HAP contract rider.
At a minimum, the rider must describe the following features of the housing to be rehabilitated and assisted under the PBV program and development activity to be performed:
(1) A description of any required work item necessary to comply with the accessibility requirements of § 983.153(e);
(2) A description of any required work item if the requirement at § 983.153(f) to install broadband infrastructure applies;
(3) A description of the work to be performed under the rider, including the rehabilitation work write-up and, where determined necessary by the PHA, specifications and plans;
(4) Any requirements the PHA elects to establish in addition to HQS for design, architecture, or quality. The PHA must specify the conditions under which it will require additional housing quality requirements in the Administrative Plan.
(5) The development status of each specific contract unit. Specifically:
(i) The rider must list each unit that is available for occupancy by an assisted family at the time the unit is placed on the HAP contract. Each contract unit that fully complies with HQS in accordance with the PHA determination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section and that the owner will make available for occupancy by an assisted
family must be initially categorized as available for occupancy. For each unit that is available for occupancy, the rider must specify whether the owner will undertake development activity in the unit after it is occupied by an assisted family. The owner may initiate the development activity in the unit while it is occupied, subject to paragraph (g)(6) of this section, or when it becomes vacant, which may change the status of the unit for purposes of this paragraph. The owner must promptly notify the PHA of any change in the status of each unit throughout the period of development activity, in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan;
(ii) The rider must list each unit that is unavailable for occupancy at the time the unit is placed on the HAP contract. Each contract unit that has not been inspected in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section or that has been inspected and did not fully comply with HQS must be initially categorized as unavailable for occupancy. The owner must promptly notify the PHA of any change in the status of each unit throughout the period of development activity, in the form and manner required by the PHA's Administrative Plan; and
(6) The deadline for completion of the work to be performed under the rider, which must be no more than five years from the date the HAP contract is effective (the five-year maximum includes any extensions granted by the PHA).
(f)
Contract and rider amendment.
In general, the PHA and owner may agree to amend the contents of the rider described in paragraph (e) of this section by executing an addendum to the rider, so long as such amendments are consistent with all requirements of this part 983. However, the following requirements apply:
(1) In the case of additions or substitutions of units, the provisions of § 983.207 apply, except:
(i) The PHA and owner must also amend the rider to update the information described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section;
(ii) The units to be added must not undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to add the unit; and
(iii) Addition of a unit is prohibited while the rider is in effect if such addition will increase the number of contract units from eight or fewer units to nine or more units.
(2) The PHA and owner may only execute an addendum amending the items in paragraphs (e)(1)-(4) of this section affecting a unit prior to the PHA accepting the completed unit.
(g)
Occupancy of units during rehabilitation period.
The following requirements apply with respect to contract units that are available for occupancy at the time that the HAP contract is executed and during the period of development activity covered by the rider in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:
(1) The PHA must select families as provided in § 983.251 for PBV assistance in a contract unit that is available for occupancy. Upon PHA acceptance of a completed unit (see § 983.156(b)(3)) that is vacant, the PHA may either select a family from the waiting list for PBV assistance in the newly completed unit or offer to transfer a family assisted in a different contract unit to the newly completed unit as described in paragraph (g)(6)(iii) of this section.
(2) The PHA may refer a family for occupancy of a contract unit only if the unit fully complies with HQS as determined by the PHA inspection.
(3) The PHA must provide a notice to the family upon selection explaining:
(i) The expected nature and duration of the development activity at the project;
(ii) That if the family accepts the unit and the owner fails to complete the development activity in accordance with applicable requirements, the PHA may terminate the HAP contract, in which case the family will be issued a tenant-based voucher and may be able to remain in the project with tenant-based assistance (see § 983.206(b));
(iii) If development activity is expected to occur in the family's unit per paragraph (e)(5) of this section, that the family may be required to vacate the unit temporarily or with continued voucher assistance;
(iv) That the family may choose to decline the unit and remain on the waiting list; and
(v) If applicable, in the case of an eligible in-place family, that the family may choose not to accept PBV assistance in the unit.
(4) The PHA must conduct periodic and other inspections on occupied contract units in accordance with the requirements of § 983.103(e) and (f) and must vigorously enforce the owner's obligation to maintain contract units occupied by an assisted family in accordance with the requirements of § 983.208.
(5) The PHA makes payments to the owner for occupied units as provided in § 983.351.
(6) When an owner will undertake development activity in a unit currently occupied by an assisted family as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the requirements of this paragraph (g)(6) govern where the family will live during the rehabilitation. For purposes of this paragraph, all references to the HQS applicable to the unit include items and components within the primary and secondary means of egress, common features, and systems equipment as described by 24 CFR 5.703(a)(2).
(i) The owner must complete the development activity without the family vacating the unit if the PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the development activity in a manner that:
(A) Does not result in life-threatening deficiencies;
(B) Does not result in any other deficiencies under the HQS that are not corrected within 30 days; and
(C) Is mutually agreeable to the owner and the family;
(ii) If the conditions for in-place development activity in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section cannot be achieved, the owner must temporarily relocate the family to complete the development activity if:
(A) The PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the relocation and development activity within a single calendar month (beginning no sooner than the first day of a month and ending no later than the last day of the same month); and
(B) The family can be relocated to a location and in a manner mutually agreeable to the owner and the family; and
(iii) If the conditions for in-place development activity in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section and temporary relocation in paragraph (g)(6)(ii) of this section cannot be achieved, the following protocol for lease termination and relocation applies:
(A) If there are contract units within the project that are designated as available for occupancy and that are vacant or expected to become vacant at the time of the planned lease termination, the PHA must refer the family to the owner for occupancy of an appropriate-size contract unit. If the family accepts the offered unit, the owner must provide the family with a reasonable time to move to the offered unit, must pay the family's reasonable moving expenses, must execute a lease with the family for the offered unit to be effective at the time of the family's move, and must terminate the lease for the family's original unit at the time of the family's move. The owner must terminate the family's lease if the family rejects the offered unit; however, the PHA must first offer the family a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (g)(6)(iii)(B) of this section if needed as a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities. The PHA must consider other family requests for a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (g)(6)(iii)(B) of this section;
(B) If no other contract unit within the project is available for the family to lease during the period of development activity, the PHA must issue the family a tenant-based voucher. However, the PHA is not required to issue the family a voucher if the PHA has offered the family an alternative housing option (
e.g.,
an assisted unit in another PBV project), and the family chooses to accept the alternative housing option instead of the voucher. The PHA may also issue the family a tenant-based voucher to accommodate the family's need or request as provided in
paragraph (g)(6)(iii)(A) of this section. The PHA must issue the voucher no fewer than 90 calendar days prior to the planned lease termination. If the family is eligible and willing to request a voucher to move in accordance with § 983.261, the PHA must issue the family the voucher to move under that section. If the family is not eligible or is unwilling to request a voucher to move under § 983.261, the PHA must remove the family's unit from the PBV HAP contract and issue the family its voucher to move with tenant-based assistance and subsequently add a unit back to the PBV HAP contract at the earlier of the time that the PHA has an authorized voucher unit available or the time that the unit is ready for occupancy. The PHA must extend the voucher term until the family either leases a unit with the tenant-based voucher or accepts a contract unit, whichever occurs first;
(C) If the family moves from the project in order for the owner to undertake development activity in the family's unit, the PHA must offer the family the option to return to the project with PBV assistance, if the family is eligible for PBV assistance, following completion of development activity at the project. The PHA, or owner in the case of an owner-maintained waiting list, must place the family on the PBV waiting list with an absolute selection preference for occupancy in the project; and
(D) If the family moves from the project in order for the owner to undertake development activity in the family's unit, the PHA must not refer any family for occupancy of the unit until after rehabilitation of the unit and PHA acceptance of the completed unit (see § 983.156(b)(3)).
(h)
Owner breach.
The owner's failure to complete the development activity as provided in the rider is a breach of the HAP contract and may result in the termination of the HAP contract, in accordance with the following requirements:
(1) If the owner has not completed the development activity by the deadline specified in the rider, which includes any extensions granted by the PHA, (see paragraph (e)(6) of this section), the PHA may grant an additional period for compliance to allow the owner more time to complete the development activity. The granting of any such period must be consistent with the PHA's Administrative Plan and must not exceed 180 days. If the owner has not completed the development activity following the period for compliance, the PHA must terminate the contract. In addition to termination, the PHA may exercise any of its other rights or remedies under the HAP contract. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve a PHA's request for an extension of the period for compliance beyond 180 days. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including any extenuating circumstances that contributed to the delay.
(2) The owner's failure to comply with the development requirements of § 983.153 constitutes a breach of the HAP contract (see § 983.206(c)(2)). In the event that the owner's failure constituted only a de minimis error in the owner's compliance with the development requirements of § 983.153, the PHA may decide to take an action other than termination of the HAP contract. In all other cases, the PHA must terminate the HAP contract, in addition to any other rights and remedies the PHA chooses to exercise under the HAP contract.
(i)
PHA-owned units.
For PHA-owned units, the independent entity must perform the inspections required under paragraphs (b)(1) and (g) of this section and make the determinations in paragraphs (g)(6)(i) and (g)(6)(ii)(A) when the owner will undertake development activity in a unit currently occupied by an assisted family, as applicable.

§ 983.204
Execution of HAP Contract or PHA-owned Certification.
(a)
PHA inspection of housing.
Before execution of the HAP contract, the PHA must determine that applicable pre-HAP contract HQS requirements have been met in accordance with § 983.103(b) or (c) as applicable. The PHA may not execute the HAP contract for any contract unit that does not meet the pre-HAP contract HQS requirements, except as provided in paragraph (c).
(b)
Existing housing.
For existing housing, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after PHA selection of the owner proposal and PHA determination that the applicable pre-HAP contract HQS requirements have been met.
(c)
Newly constructed or rehabilitated housing.
For newly constructed or rehabilitated housing developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after the PHA determines that the housing was completed
in accordance with the applicable requirements, HUD's HQS, and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA, in accordance with § 983.156(b)(1) or (c). For rehabilitated housing that will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the HAP contract must be executed and effective promptly after the requirements of § 983.157(c) are met (all proposed PBV units are added to the contract at this time, including units that do not comply with HQS or that will undergo development activity).

§ 983.205
Term of HAP contract.
(a)
Initial term.
The PHA may enter into a HAP contract with an owner for an initial term of up to 20 years for each contract unit. The length of the term of the HAP contract for any contract unit may not be less than one year, nor more than 20 years.
(b)
Extension of term.
The PHA and owner may agree at any time before expiration of the HAP contract to execute one or more extensions of the HAP contract term. The following conditions apply:
(1) Each extension executed must have a term that does not exceed 20 years;
(2) At no time may the total remaining term of the HAP contract, with extensions, exceed 40 years;
(3) Before agreeing to an extension, the PHA must determine that the extension is appropriate to continue providing affordable housing for low-income families or to expand housing opportunities; and
(4) Each extension must be on the form and subject to the conditions prescribed by HUD at the time of the extension.
[89 FR 38325, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.206
Contract termination or expiration and statutory notice requirements.
(a)
Nonextension by owner—notice requirements.
(1) Notices required in accordance with this section must be provided in the form prescribed by HUD.
(2) Not less than one year before termination of a PBV HAP contract, the owner must notify the PHA and assisted tenants of the termination.
(3) The term “termination” for applicability of this notice requirement means the expiration of the HAP contract, termination of the HAP contract by agreement of PHA and owner per paragraph (e) of this section, or an owner's refusal to renew the HAP contract.
(4) If an owner fails to provide the required notice, the owner must permit the tenants in assisted units to remain in their units for the required notice period with no increase in the tenant portion of their rent, and with no eviction as a result of an owner's inability to collect an increased tenant portion of rent.
(5) An owner and PHA may agree to extend the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to provide tenants with the required notice, under such terms as HUD may require.
(b)
Termination or expiration without extension—required provision of tenant-based assistance.
Unless a termination or expiration without extension occurs due to a determination of insufficient funding pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section or other extraordinary circumstances determined by HUD, the PHA shall issue each family occupying a contract unit a tenant-based voucher based on the termination or expiration of the contract no fewer than 60 calendar days prior to the planned termination or expiration of the PBV HAP contract. However, the PHA is not required to issue the family a voucher if the PHA has offered the family an alternative housing option (
e.g.,
an assisted unit in another PBV project), and the family chooses to accept the alternative housing option instead of the voucher. Such a family is not a new
admission to the tenant-based program and shall not count toward the PHA's income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i). The voucher issued to the family is the voucher attached to its unit under the expiring or terminating PBV contract. Consequently, if the family vacates the contract unit following the issuance of the tenant-based voucher and prior to the contract termination or expiration date, the PHA must remove the unit from the PBV HAP contract at the time the family vacates the unit. The PBV HAP contract must provide that, if the units continue to be used for rental housing upon termination or expiration without extension of a PBV HAP contract, each assisted family may elect to use its tenant-based assistance to remain in the same project, subject to the following:
(1) The unit must comply with HUD's HQS;
(2) The PHA must determine or have determined that the rent for the unit is reasonable;
(3) The family must pay its required share of the rent and the amount, if any, by which the unit rent (including the amount allowed for tenant-based utilities) exceeds the applicable payment standard (the limitation at 24 CFR 982.508 regarding maximum family share at initial occupancy shall not apply); and
(4) The owner may not refuse to initially lease a unit in the project to a family that elects to use their tenant-based assistance to remain in the same project, except where the owner will use the unit for a purpose other than a residential rental unit. The owner may not later terminate the tenancy of such a family, except for the following grounds:
(i) The grounds in 24 CFR 982.310 of this title, except paragraphs 24 CFR 982.310(d)(1)(iii) and (iv);
(ii) The owner's desire to use the unit for a purpose other than a residential rental unit; and
(iii) The owner's desire to renovate the unit, subject to the following:
(A) The owner must consider whether a reasonable alternative to terminating the lease exists. If a reasonable alternative exists, the owner must not terminate the lease. The owner must consider the following alternatives:
(
1
) Completing renovations without the family vacating the unit, if the renovations can be completed in a manner that does not result in life-threatening conditions, does not result in deficiencies under HQS that are not corrected within 30 days, and is mutually agreeable to the owner and the family; and
(
2
) Temporarily relocating the family to complete the renovations, if the relocation and renovations can be completed within a single calendar month (beginning no sooner than the first day of a month and ending no later than the last day of the same month) and the family can be relocated to a location and in a manner mutually agreeable to the owner and the family;
(B) If the owner terminates the lease for renovation, the owner must make every reasonable effort to make available and lease the family another unit within the project that meets the tenant-based voucher program requirements; and
(C) If no other unit within the project is available for the family to lease during the renovation period or the family chooses to move from the project during the renovation period, the owner must make every reasonable effort to make available and lease the family a unit within the project upon completion of renovations.
(c)
Termination by PHA.
(1) The HAP contract must provide that the PHA may terminate the contract for insufficient funding, subject to HUD requirements.
(i) Consistent with the policies in the PHA's Administrative Plan, the PHA has the option of terminating a PBV HAP contract based on “insufficient funding” only if:
(A) The PHA determines in accordance with HUD requirements that it lacks sufficient HAP funding (including HAP reserves) to continue to make housing assistance payments for all voucher units currently under a HAP contract;
(B) The PHA has taken cost-saving measures specified by HUD;
(C) The PHA notifies HUD of its determination and provides the information required by HUD; and
(D) HUD determines that the PHA lacks sufficient funding and notifies the PHA it may terminate HAP contracts as a result.
(2) If the PHA determines that the owner has breached the HAP contract, the PHA may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the HAP contract, including but not limited to contract termination. The provisions of § 983.208 apply for HAP contract breaches involving failure to comply with HQS. For any other contract termination due to breach, paragraph (b) of this section on provision of tenant-based assistance applies.
(d)
Termination by owner—reduction below initial rent.
If the amount of the rent to owner for any contract unit, as adjusted in accordance with § 983.302, is reduced below the amount of the initial rent to owner, the owner may terminate the HAP contract, upon notice to the PHA no fewer than 90 calendar days prior to the planned termination, and families must be provided tenant-based assistance and may elect to remain in the project in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The owner is not required to provide the one-year notice of the termination of the HAP contract to the family and the PHA, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, when terminating the HAP contract due to rent reduction below the initial rent to owner.
(e)
Termination by agreement of PHA and owner.
The PHA and owner may agree to terminate the HAP contract prior to the end of the term. The owner's notice in paragraph (a) of this section is required prior to termination, and the families must be provided tenant-based assistance and may elect to remain in the project in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
[89 FR 38325, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.207
HAP contract amendments (to add or substitute contract units).
(a)
Amendment to substitute contract units.
At the discretion of the PHA, the PHA and owner may execute an amendment to the HAP contract to substitute a different unit with the same number of bedrooms in the same project for a previously covered contract unit. Prior to such substitution, the PHA must inspect the proposed substitute unit (the unit must comply with HQS to be substituted) and must determine the reasonable rent for such unit (the rent to owner must be reasonable for the unit to be substituted). The proposed substituted unit may be vacant or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, it may be occupied. The proposed substituted unit may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to substitute the unit, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The proposed substituted unit must have existed at the time described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Amendment to add contract units.
At the discretion of the PHA, and provided that the total number of units in a project that will receive PBV assistance will not exceed the limitations in § 983.6 or § 983.54, the PHA and owner may execute an amendment to the HAP contract to add PBV units in the same project to the contract, without a new proposal selection. Prior to such addition, the PHA must inspect the proposed added unit (the unit must comply with HQS to be added) and must determine the reasonable rent for such unit (the rent to owner must be reasonable for the unit to be added).
(1) Added units that qualify for an exclusion from the program cap (as described in § 983.59) or an exception to or exclusion from the project cap (as described in § 983.54(c) and § 983.59, respectively) will not count toward such cap(s).
(2) The anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract for the additional units must be the same as the anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract term for the PBV units originally placed under HAP contract.
(3) The added unit may be vacant or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, it may be occupied.
(4) The unit may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to add the unit, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(5) The added unit must have existed at the time described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Substituting or adding occupied units.
The PHA may place occupied
units on the HAP contract under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, subject to the following:
(1) The family occupying the unit must be eligible for assistance per §§ 983.53(a)(3) and 983.251(a);
(2) The unit must be appropriate for the size of the family occupying the unit under the PHA's subsidy standards;
(3) The family must be selected from the waiting list in accordance with the applicable selection policies; and
(4) The unit may be occupied by a family who was assisted with a tenant-based voucher immediately prior to the unit being placed on the PBV HAP contract. The tenant-based HAP contract for the unit must terminate before the unit may be placed under the PBV HAP contract. The family occupying the unit is not a new admission to the voucher program. The option described in this paragraph (c)(4) is subject to the following conditions:
(i) If the family is in the initial term of the tenant-based lease, the family agreed to mutually terminate the tenant-based lease with the owner and enter into a PBV lease.
(ii) If the initial term of the tenant-based lease has passed or the end of that term coincides with the time at which the unit will be placed on the PBV HAP contract, upon the owner's decision not to renew the tenant-based lease or to terminate the tenant-based lease in accordance with 24 CFR 982.308 or 982.310, respectively, the family agreed to relinquish the tenant-based voucher and enter into a PBV lease.
(d)
Substituting or adding units that underwent repairs or renovation.
A unit that is not under a HAP contract but is in a project with other units that are under a HAP contract may undergo repairs or renovation prior to amending the PBV HAP contract to add or substitute the unit, except in the case of a contract subject to a rider under the rehabilitated housing option for development activity after HAP contract execution in accordance with § 983.157. If such repairs or renovation constitute substantial improvement as defined in § 983.3, then:
(1) The substantial improvement must not proceed prior to the first two years of the effective date of the HAP contract, except in extraordinary circumstances (
e.g.,
the units were damaged by fire, natural disaster, etc.).
(2) The substantial improvement is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).
(3) As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to substantial improvement.
(4) Any substantial improvement that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the substantial improvement while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:
(i) The location of the substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or
(iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
(5) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in substantial improvement. The
HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.
(6) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the HAP contract or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.
(7) The requirements for additional assistance after HAP contract at § 983.11(d) apply.
(8) Section 983.155, Completion of work, applies.
(9) Paragraphs (a), (b)(4), and (d) of § 983.156, PHA acceptance of completed units, apply.
(e)
Restriction on substituting or adding newly built units.
Units may only be added to the HAP contract or substituted for a previously covered contract unit if one of the following conditions applies:
(1) The units to be added or substituted existed at the time of HAP contract execution;
(2) In the case of a project completed in stages, the units to be added or substituted existed at the time of PHA acceptance of the last completed unit(s) per § 983.156(c); or
(3) A unit, office space, or common area within the interior of a building containing contract units existed at the time described in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, and is reconfigured without impacting the building envelope, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, into one or more units to be added or substituted.
(f)
Administrative Plan requirement.
The PHA must describe in the Administrative Plan the circumstances under which it will add or substitute contract units, and how those circumstances support the goals of the PBV program.
(g)
Staged completion of contract units.
Even if contract units are placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates, there is a single annual anniversary for all contract units under the HAP contract. The annual anniversary for all contract units is the annual anniversary date for the first contract units placed under the HAP contract. The expiration of the HAP contract for all the contract units completed in stages must be concurrent with the end of the HAP contract term for the units originally placed under HAP contract.
(h)
Amendment to merge or bifurcate HAP contracts.
HUD may establish a process allowing the PHA and owner to agree to merge two or more HAP contracts for PBV assistance on the same project, or to bifurcate a HAP contract, by
Federal Register
notice subject to public comment.
[89 FR 38326, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.208
Condition of contract units.
(a) Owner maintenance and operation. (1) The owner must maintain and operate the contract units and premises in accordance with the HQS, including performance of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance.
(2) The owner must provide all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities specified in the HAP contract with the PHA and in the lease with each assisted family.
(3) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may also require continuing owner compliance during the HAP contract term with additional housing quality requirements specified by the PHA (in addition to, but not in place of, compliance with HUD's HQS). Such additional requirements may be designed to assure continued compliance with any design, architecture, or quality requirement specified by the PHA (§ 983.204(c)). The PHA must specify the conditions under which it will require additional housing quality requirements in the Administrative Plan.
(b)
Enforcement of HQS.
(1) The PHA must vigorously enforce the owner's obligation to maintain contract units in accordance with HUD's HQS. If the owner fails to maintain the dwelling unit in accordance with HQS, the PHA must take enforcement action in accordance with this section.
(2) The unit is in noncompliance with HQS if:
(i) The PHA or other inspector authorized by the State or local government determines the unit has HQS deficiencies based upon an inspection;
(ii) The agency or inspector notifies the owner in writing of the unit HQS deficiencies; and
(iii) The unit HQS deficiencies are not remedied within the following timeframes:
(A) For life-threatening deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 24 hours of notification.
(B) For other deficiencies, the owner must correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days of notification (or any reasonable PHA-approved extension).
(3) In the case of an HQS deficiency that the PHA determines is caused by the tenant, any member of the household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, other than any damage resulting from ordinary use, the PHA may waive the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation. Housing assistance payments to the owner may not be withheld or abated if the owner responsibility has been waived. However, the PHA may terminate assistance to a family because of an HQS breach beyond damage resulting from ordinary use caused by any member of the household or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, which may result in removing the unit from the HAP contract.
(4) In the case of an HQS deficiency that is caused by fire, natural disaster, or similar extraordinary circumstances, the PHA may permit the owner to undertake substantial improvement in accordance with § 983.212. However, so long as the contract unit with deficiencies is occupied, the PHA must withhold or abate housing assistance payments and remove units from or terminate the HAP contract as described in this section.
(5) In the case of a project that is undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, the remedies of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to units designated as unavailable for occupancy during the period of development activity in accordance with the rider. However, in the case of any contract unit with deficiencies that is occupied, the PHA must withhold or abate housing assistance payments and remove units from or terminate the HAP contract as described in this section.
(c)
Family obligation.
(1) The family may be held responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:
(i) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the owner is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the tenant;
(ii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the owner is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the tenant; or
(iii) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear).
(2) If the PHA has waived the owner's responsibility to remedy the violation in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the following applies:
(i) If the HQS breach caused by the family is life-threatening, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 24 hours of notification.
(ii) For other family-caused deficiencies, the family must take all steps permissible under the lease and State and local law to ensure the deficiency is corrected within 30 calendar days of notification (or any PHA-approved extension).
(3) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for the family in accordance with 24 CFR 982.552.
(d)
PHA remedies.
These remedies apply when HQS deficiencies are identified as the result of an inspection other than a pre-selection, initial, or turnover inspection. (See § 983.103 generally, and see § 983.103(c) in particular for PHA enforcement actions related to the initial HQS inspection for existing housing). The PHA must identify in its Administrative Plan the conditions under which it will withhold HAP and the conditions under which it will abate HAP or terminate the HAP contract for units other than the unit with HQS deficiencies.
(1) A PHA may withhold HAP for an individual unit that has HQS deficiencies once the PHA has notified the owner in writing of the deficiencies. If
the unit is brought into compliance during the applicable cure period (within 24 hours from notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days from notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA for non-life-threatening deficiencies), the PHA:
(i) Must resume assistance payments; and
(ii) Must provide assistance payments to cover the time period for which the assistance payments were withheld.
(2)(i) The PHA must abate the HAP, including amounts that had been withheld, for the PBV unit with deficiencies if the owner fails to make the repairs within the applicable cure period (within 24 hours from notification for life-threatening deficiencies and within 30 days from notification (or other reasonable period established by the PHA) for non-life-threatening deficiencies).
(ii) The PHA may choose to abate payments for all units covered by the HAP contract due to a contract unit's noncompliance with the HQS, even if some of the contract units continue to meet HQS.
(iii) If a PHA abates the HAP for a unit, the PHA must notify the family and the owner that it is abating payments and that if the unit with deficiencies does not meet HQS within 60 days after the determination of noncompliance (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA), the PHA will either terminate the HAP contract or remove the unit with deficiencies from the HAP contract, and any family residing in a unit that does not comply with HQS will have to move if the family wishes to receive continued assistance.
(3) An owner may not terminate the tenancy of any family due to the withholding or abatement of assistance. During the period that assistance is abated, the family may terminate the tenancy by notifying the owner. The PHA must promptly issue the family a tenant-based voucher to move.
(4) If the owner makes the repairs and the unit complies with HQS within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner if the unit is still occupied by an assisted family. The PHA does not make any payments for the unit to the owner for the period of time that the payments were abated.
(5) If the owner fails to make the repairs within 60 days (or a reasonable longer period established by the PHA) of the notice of abatement, the PHA must either remove the unit from the HAP contract or terminate the HAP contract in its entirety. The PHA must issue the family whose unit will be removed or all families residing in contract units, if the PHA is terminating the HAP contract, a tenant-based voucher to move at least 30 days prior to the removal of the unit from the HAP contract or termination of the HAP contract. A family may elect to remain in the project in accordance with § 983.206(b) if the project contains a unit that meets the requirements of that section, with priority given to families who will remain in the same unit if there are insufficient units available to accommodate all families that wish to remain.
(6)(i) The PHA must give any family residing in a unit that is either removed from the HAP contract or for which the HAP contract is terminated under this paragraph (d) due to a failure to correct HQS deficiencies at least 90 days or a longer period as the PHA determines is reasonably necessary following the termination of the HAP contract or removal of the unit from the HAP contract to lease a unit with tenant-based assistance.
(ii) If the family is unable to lease a new unit within the period provided by the PHA under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section and the PHA owns or operates public housing, the PHA must offer, and, if accepted, provide the family a selection preference for an appropriate-size public housing unit that first becomes available for occupancy after the time period expires.
(iii) PHAs may assist families relocating under this paragraph (d) in finding a new unit, including using up to 2 months of the withheld and abated assistance payments for costs directly associated with relocating to a new unit, including security deposits, temporary housing costs, or other reasonable moving costs as determined by the
PHA based on their locality. PHAs must assist families with disabilities in locating available accessible units in accordance with 24 CFR 8.28(a)(3). If the PHA uses the withheld and abated assistance payments to assist with the family's relocation costs, the PHA must provide security deposit assistance to the family as necessary. If the family receives security deposit assistance from the PHA for the new unit, the PHA may require the family to remit the security deposit returned by the owner of the new unit at such time that the lease is terminated, up to the amount of the security deposit assistance provided by the PHA for that unit. The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the policies it will implement for this provision.
(e)
Maintenance and replacement—Owner's standard practice.
Maintenance and replacement (including redecoration) must be in accordance with the standard practice for the building concerned as established by the owner.
(f)
Applicability.
This section is applicable to HAP contracts executed on or after or extended on or after June 6, 2024.

§ 983.210
Owner certification.
By execution of the HAP contract, the owner certifies that at such execution and at all times during the term of the HAP contract:
(a) The owner is maintaining the premises and all contract units in accordance with HUD's HQS under the requirements of this part 983.
(b) The owner is providing all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities as agreed to under the HAP contract and the leases with assisted families.
(c) Each contract unit for which the owner is receiving housing assistance payments is leased to an eligible family referred by the PHA or selected from the owner-maintained waiting list in accordance with § 983.251, and the lease is in accordance with the HAP contract and HUD requirements.
(d) To the best of the owner's knowledge, the members of the family reside in each contract unit for which the owner is receiving housing assistance payments, and the unit is the family's only residence, except as provided in §§ 983.157(g)(6)(ii) and 983.212(a)(3)(ii).
(e) The owner (including a principal or other interested party) is not the spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of a family residing in a contract unit unless needed as a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities.
(f) The amount of the housing assistance payment is the correct amount due under the HAP contract.
(g) The rent to owner for each contract unit does not exceed rents charged by the owner for other comparable unassisted units.
(h) Except for the housing assistance payment and the tenant rent as provided under the HAP contract, the owner has not received and will not receive any payment or other consideration (from the family, the PHA, HUD, or any other public or private source) for rental of the contract unit.
(i) The family does not own or have any interest in the contract unit. The certification required by this section does not apply in the case of an assisted family's membership in a cooperative.

§ 983.211
Removal of unit from HAP contract based on a family's increased income.
(a)
Removal of a unit based on a family's increased income.
Units occupied by families whose income has increased during their tenancy resulting in the total tenant payment equaling the gross rent shall be removed from the HAP contract 180 days following the last housing assistance payment on behalf of the family.
(b)
Reinstatement or substitution of HAP contracts.
If the project is fully assisted, a PHA may reinstate the unit removed under
paragraph (a)
of this section to the HAP contract after the ineligible family vacates the property. If the project is partially assisted, a PHA may substitute a different unit for the unit removed under
paragraph (a)
of this section to the HAP contract when the first eligible substitute becomes available. A reinstatement or substitution of units under the HAP contract, in accordance with this paragraph, must be permissible under § 983.207(b) or (a), respectively.
(c)
Additional requirements.
The anniversary and expirations dates of the reinstated or substituted unit must be the same as all other units under the HAP contract (
i.e.,
the annual anniversary and expiration dates for the first contract units placed under the HAP contract). Families must be selected in accordance with program requirements under § 983.251 of this part.
[89 FR 38329, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.212
Substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract.
(a)
Substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract.
The owner may undertake substantial improvement on a unit currently under a HAP contract, except a contract subject to a rider under the rehabilitated housing option for development activity after HAP contract execution in accordance with § 983.157, if approved to do so by the PHA. The owner may request PHA approval no earlier than the effective date of the HAP contract. The following conditions apply:
(1) The PHA may approve the substantial improvement only if one of the following conditions apply:
(i) The unit has been damaged by fire or natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances exist which require a unit previously compliant with HQS to urgently undergo substantial improvement. For this purpose, “extraordinary circumstances” are unforeseen events that are not the fault of the owner. The PHA may provide approval for substantial improvement resulting from the damage or extraordinary circumstances described in this paragraph (a)(1)(i) after the owner submits the request.
(ii) The owner requests to engage in substantial improvement that will commence following the first two years of the effective date of the HAP contract. The PHA may provide approval for substantial improvement occurring as described in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) after the owner submits the request, but no earlier than twenty-one months after the effective date of the HAP contract.
(2) The owner's request must include a description of the substantial improvement proposed to be undertaken and the length of time, if any, the owner anticipates that the unit, including items and components within the primary and secondary means of egress, common features, and systems equipment as described by 24 CFR 5.703(a)(2), will not meet HQS. The PHA must not approve as substantial improvement, under this section, an owner's request to demolish a building containing contract units and newly construct replacement units (see requirements for contract termination at § 983.206 and requirements for newly constructed housing in this part 983).
(3) If the unit is occupied and will not meet HQS during any part of the period of the substantial improvement, the owner's request must include a description of the owner's plan to house the family during the period the unit will not meet HQS. The PHA must not approve the substantial improvement unless the owner's plan complies with one of the following requirements:
(i) The owner must complete the substantial improvement without the family vacating the unit if the PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the substantial improvement in a manner that:
(A) Does not result in life-threatening deficiencies;
(B) Does not result in any other deficiencies under the HQS that are not corrected within 30 days; and
(C) Is mutually agreeable to the owner and the family;
(ii) If the conditions for in-place substantial improvement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section cannot be achieved, the owner must temporarily relocate the family to complete the substantial improvement if:
(A) The PHA reasonably expects that the owner can complete the relocation and substantial improvement within a single calendar month (beginning no sooner than the first day of a month and ending no later than the last day of the same month); and
(B) The family can be relocated to a location and in a manner mutually agreeable to the owner and the family; and
(iii) If the conditions for in-place substantial improvement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and temporary relocation in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section cannot be achieved, the following protocol for lease termination and relocation applies:
(A) If there are contract units within the project will meet HQS during the period of substantial improvement and that are vacant or expected to become vacant at the time of the planned lease termination, the PHA must refer the family to the owner for occupancy of an appropriate-size contract unit. If the family accepts the offered unit, the owner must provide the family with a reasonable time to move to the offered unit, must pay the family's reasonable moving expenses, must execute a lease with the family for the offered unit to be effective at the time of the family's move, and must terminate the lease for the family's original unit at the time of the family's move. The owner must terminate the family's lease if the family rejects the offered unit; however, the PHA must first offer the family a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section if needed as a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities. The PHA must consider other family requests for a different unit or tenant-based assistance under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section;
(B) If no other contract unit within the project is available for the family to lease during the period of substantial improvement, the PHA must issue the family a tenant-based voucher. However, the PHA is not required to issue the family a voucher if the PHA has offered the family an alternative housing option (
e.g.,
an assisted unit in another PBV project), and the family chooses to accept the alternative housing option instead of the voucher. The PHA may also issue the family a tenant-based voucher to accommodate the family's need or request as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. The PHA must issue the voucher no fewer than 90 calendar days prior to the planned lease termination in the case of substantial improvement pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The PHA must issue the voucher as soon as practicable in the case of substantial improvement pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. If the family is eligible and willing to request a voucher to move in accordance with § 983.261, the PHA must issue the family the voucher to move under that section. If the family is not eligible or is unwilling to request a voucher to move under § 983.261, the PHA must remove the family's unit from the PBV HAP contract and issue the family its voucher to move with tenant-based assistance and subsequently add a unit back to the PBV HAP contract at such time that the unit is ready for occupancy. The PHA must extend the voucher term until the family either leases a unit with the tenant-based voucher or accepts a contract unit, whichever occurs first; and
(C) If the family moves from the project during the period of substantial improvement, the PHA must offer the family the option to return to the project with PBV assistance, if the family is eligible for PBV assistance, following completion of substantial improvement at the project. The PHA, or owner in the case of an absolute selection preference for occupancy in the project.
(4) The PHA must abate housing assistance payments for a unit beginning at the time the unit has any deficiency under HUD's HQS during the period of substantial improvement. The timing for the PHA to begin withholding and abatement specified in § 983.208(d) does not apply to deficiencies occurring during the period of substantial improvement. When all deficiencies in the unit are corrected, the PHA must recommence payments to the owner if the unit is still occupied by an assisted family, subject to paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(1) of this section. Additionally, the PHA must not pay vacancy payments during the period of substantial improvement.
(5) The terms of the PHA approval must be recorded in an addendum to the HAP contract. The PHA may choose to temporarily remove vacant units from the PBV HAP contract during the time the units will not meet HQS during the substantial improvement. If the PHA temporarily removes a unit, the PHA reinstates the unit in accordance with § 983.207(b). Owner failure to complete the substantial improvement as approved shall be a breach of the HAP contract and the PHA may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the HAP contract, including but not limited to contract termination pursuant to § 983.206(c)(2).
(b)
Applicable requirements.
(1) Substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).
(2) As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.
(3) Any substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the substantial improvement while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:
(i) The location of the substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or
(iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
(4) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in substantial improvement undertaken on units subject to a HAP contract. The HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.
(5) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the HAP contract or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.
(6) The requirements for additional assistance after HAP contract at § 983.11(d) apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.
(7) Section 983.155, Completion of work, applies to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.
(8) Section 983.156(a), Inspection of units, and (d), PHA-owned units, apply to substantial improvement undertaken on units that are currently under a HAP contract.
(c)
PHA-owned units.
For PHA-owned units, the independent entity must determine whether to approve the PHA proposal to undertake substantial improvement as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, including making the determinations in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii)(A) when the owner will undertake substantial improvement in a unit currently occupied by an assisted family, as applicable (see § 983.57(b)(4)). The independent entity must approve the proposal if:
(1) The proposed substantial improvement meets one of the conditions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
(2) The description of the substantial improvement does not include plans to demolish a building containing contract units and newly construct replacement units; and
(3) The plan to house each family during the period that family's unit will not meet HQS complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3).
[89 FR 38329, May 7, 2024]

# Subpart F—Occupancy
§ 983.251
How participants are selected.
(a) Who may receive PBV assistance? (1) The PHA may select families who are participants in the PHA's tenant-based voucher program and families who have applied for admission to the voucher program.
(2) Except for voucher participants (determined eligible at original admission to the voucher program), the PHA may only select families determined eligible for admission at commencement of PBV assistance, using information received and verified by the PHA within a period of 60 days before commencement of PBV assistance. For all families, the PHA must determine the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP.
(3) The protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to admission to the project-based program.
(4) A PHA may not approve a tenancy if the owner (including a principal or other interested party) of a unit is the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of the family, unless the PHA determines that approving the unit would provide reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities.
(b)
Protection of in-place families.
(1) To minimize displacement of in-place families, if an in-place family is determined to be eligible prior to placement of the family's unit on the HAP contract, the in-place family must be placed on the PBV waiting list (if the family is not already on the list) and given an absolute selection preference. If the PHA's waiting list for PBV assistance is not a project-specific waiting list, the PHA must refer the family to the applicable project owner for an appropriate-size PBV unit in the specific project.
(2) If the in-place family is a tenant-based voucher participant, program eligibility is not re-determined. However, the PHA must determine that the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent for the unit, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP, and the PHA may deny or terminate assistance for the grounds specified in 24 CFR 982.552 and 982.553.
(3)(i) During the initial term of the lease under the tenant-based tenancy, an in-place tenant-based voucher family may agree, but is not required, to mutually terminate the lease with the owner and enter into a lease and tenancy under the PBV program. If the family chooses to continue the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the unit may not be added to the PBV HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the lease for other good cause during the initial term unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do in accordance with 24 CFR 982.310(d)(2). The owner is expressly prohibited from terminating
the tenancy during the initial term of the lease based on the family's failure to accept the offer of a new lease or revision, or for a business or economic reason.
(ii) If, after the initial term, the owner chooses not to renew the lease or terminates the lease for other good cause (as defined in 24 CFR 982.310(d)) to end the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the family would be required to move with continued tenant-based assistance or relinquish the tenant-based voucher and enter into a new lease to receive PBV assistance in order to remain in the unit.
(4) Admission of in-place families is not subject to income-targeting under 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i).
(c)
Selection from waiting list.
(1) Applicants who will occupy PBV units must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program.
(2) The PHA must identify in the Administrative Plan which of the following options it will use to structure the waiting list for the PBV program:
(i) The PHA may use a separate, central, waiting list comprised of more than one, or all, PBV projects;
(ii) The PHA may use the same waiting list for both tenant-based assistance and some or all PBV projects; or
(iii) The PHA may use separate waiting lists for PBV units in individual projects or buildings (or for sets of such units). This option may be used in combination with the option in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. The PHA must specify the name of the PBV project in the Administrative Plan. The PHA may permit the owner to maintain such waiting lists (see paragraph (c)(7) of this section for more information).
(3) For any of the options under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PHA may establish in its Administrative Plan any preferences for occupancy of particular units including the name of the project(s) and the specific preferences that are to be used by project. Criteria for occupancy of units (
e.g.,
elderly families) may also be established; however, selection of families must be done through an admissions preference.
(4) The PHA may merge the waiting list for PBV assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program.
(5) Where applicable, the PHA may place families referred by the PBV owner on its PBV waiting list.
(6) If the PHA chooses to use a separate waiting list for admission to PBV units under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, the PHA must offer to place applicants who are listed on the waiting list for tenant-based assistance on the waiting list for PBV assistance (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists).
(7) PHAs using separate waiting lists for individual projects or buildings, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, may establish in their Administrative Plan that owners will maintain such waiting lists. PHAs may choose to use owner-maintained PBV waiting lists for specific owners or projects. PHAs may permit an owner to maintain a single waiting list across multiple projects owned by the owner. Under an owner-maintained waiting list, the owner is responsible for carrying out responsibilities including, but not limited to, processing changes in applicant information, removing an applicant's name from the waiting list, opening and closing the waiting list. PHAs must identify in their Administrative Plans the name of the project(s), the oversight procedures the PHA will use to ensure owner-maintained waiting lists are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, and the approval process of an owner's waiting list policy (including any preferences). Where a PHA allows for owner-maintained waiting lists, all the following apply:
(i) The owner must develop and submit a written owner waiting list policy to the PHA for approval. The owner waiting list policy must include policies and procedures concerning waiting list management and selection of applicants from the project's waiting list, including any admission preferences, procedures for removing applicant names from the waiting list, and procedures for closing and reopening the waiting list. The owner must receive approval from the PHA of its owner waiting list policy in accordance with the process established in the PHA's
Administrative Plan. The owner's waiting list policy must be incorporated in the PHA's Administrative Plan.
(ii) The owner must receive approval from the PHA for any preferences that will be applicable to the project. The PHA will approve such preferences as part of its approval of the owner's waiting list policy. Each project may have a different set of preferences. Preferences must be consistent with the PHA Plan and listed in the owner's waiting list policy.
(iii) The owner is responsible for opening and closing the waiting list, including providing public notice when the owner opens the waiting list in accordance with 24 CFR 982.206. If the owner-maintained waiting list is open and additional applicants are needed to fill vacant units, the owner must give public notice in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 982.206 and the owner waiting list policy.
(iv) The applicant may apply directly at the project, or the applicant may request that the PHA refer the applicant to the owner for placement on the project's waiting list. The PHA must disclose to the applicant all the PBV projects available to the applicant, including the projects' contact information and other basic information about the project.
(v) Applicants already on the PHA's waiting list must be permitted to place their names on the project's waiting lists.
(vi) At the discretion of the PHA, the owner may make preliminary eligibility determinations for purposes of placing the family on the waiting list, and preference eligibility determinations. The PHA may choose to make this determination rather than delegating it to the owner.
(vii) If the PHA delegated the preliminary eligibility and preference determinations to the owner, the owner is responsible for notifying the family of the owner's determination not to place the applicant on the waiting list and a determination that the family is not eligible for a preference. In such a case, the owner is responsible to provide the notice at 24 CFR 982.554(a) of this title. The PHA is then responsible for conducting the informal review.
(viii) Once an owner selects the family from the waiting list, the owner refers the family to the PHA who then determines the family's final program eligibility. The owner may not offer a unit to the family until the PHA determines that the family is eligible for the program.
(ix) All HCV waiting list administration requirements that apply to the PBV program (24 CFR part 982, subpart E, other than 24 CFR 982.201(e), 982.202(b)(2), and 982.204(d)) apply to owner-maintained waiting lists.
(x) The PHA is responsible for oversight of owner-maintained waiting lists to ensure that they are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, including but not limited to nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements under the authorities cited at 24 CFR 5.105(a). The owner is responsible for maintaining complete and accurate records as described in 24 CFR 982.158. The owner must give the PHA, HUD, and the Comptroller General full and free access to its offices and records concerning waiting list management, as described in 24 CFR 982.158(c). HUD may undertake investigation to determine whether the PHA or owner is in violation of authorities and, if unable to reach a voluntary resolution to correct the violation, take an enforcement action against either the owner or the PHA, or both.
(8) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based and project-based voucher programs during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low-income families. The income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2) apply to the total of admissions to the PHA's project-based voucher program and tenant-based voucher program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists) for such programs.
(9) Families who require particular accessibility features for persons with disabilities must be selected first to occupy PBV units with such accessibility features (see 24 CFR 8.26, 8.27, and 100.202). Also see § 983.260. The PHA shall have some mechanism for referring to accessible PBV units a family
that includes a person with a mobility or sensory impairment.
(d)
Preference for services offered.
In selecting families, PHAs (or owners in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) may give preference to families who qualify for voluntary services, including disability-specific services, offered at a particular project, consistent with the PHA Plan and Administrative Plan.
(1) The prohibition on granting preferences to persons with a specific disability at 24 CFR 982.207(b)(3) continues to apply.
(2) Families must not be required to accept the particular services offered at the project nor shall families be required to provide their own equivalent services if they decline the project's services.
(3) In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the preference must be provided to all applicants who qualify for the voluntary services offered in conjunction with the assisted units.
(e)
Offer of PBV assistance or owner's rejection.
(1) If a family refuses the PHA's offer of PBV assistance or the owner rejects a family for admission to the owner's PBV units, the family's position on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance is not affected regardless of the type of PBV waiting list used by the PHA.
(2) The impact (of a family's rejection of the offer or the owner's rejection of the family) on a family's position on the PBV waiting list will be determined as follows:
(i) If a central PBV waiting list is used, the PHA's Administrative Plan must address the number of offers a family may reject without good cause before the family is removed from the PBV waiting list and whether the owner's rejection will impact the family's place on the PBV waiting list.
(ii) If a project-specific PBV waiting list is used, the family's name is removed from the project's waiting list connected to the family's rejection of the offer without good cause or the owner's rejection of the family. The family's position on any other project-specific PBV waiting list is not affected.
(iii) The PHA must define “good cause” for purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section in its Administrative Plan. The PHA's definition of good cause must include, at minimum, that:
(A) The family determines the unit is not accessible to a household member with a disability or otherwise does not meet the member's disability-related needs;
(B) The unit has HQS deficiencies;
(C) The family is unable to accept the offer due to circumstances beyond the family's control (such as hospitalization, temporary economic hardship, or natural disaster); and
(D) The family determines the unit presents a health or safety risk to a household member who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in part 5, subpart L of this title.
(3) None of the following actions may be taken against an applicant solely because the applicant has applied for, received, or refused an offer of PBV assistance:
(i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance or any other available PBV waiting list. However, the PHA (or owner in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) is not required to open a closed waiting list to place the family on that waiting list.
(ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified.
(iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date, and time of application, or other factors affecting selection from the waiting list.
(iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list for tenant-based voucher assistance.

(1) The briefing must include information on the following subjects:
(i) A description of how the program works;
(ii) Family and owner responsibilities; and
(iii) Family right to move.
(2) The PHA must take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication in accordance with 24 CFR 8.6 and 28 CFR part 35, subpart E, and must provide information on the reasonable accommodation process.

If any contract units have been vacant for a period of 120 days or more since owner notice of vacancy, as required in paragraph (a) of this section, and notwithstanding the reasonable good-faith efforts of the PHA and the owner to fill such vacancies, the PHA may give notice to the owner amending the HAP contract to reduce the number of contract units by subtracting the number of contract units (by number of bedrooms) that have been vacant for such period.
[89 FR 38334, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.255
Tenant screening.
(a)
PHA option.

(1) The names of the owner and the tenant;
(2) The unit rented (address, apartment number, if any, and any other information needed to identify the leased contract unit);

(2) The owner must notify the PHA in advance of any proposed change in lease requirements governing the allocation of tenant and owner responsibilities for utilities. Such changes may be made only if approved by the PHA and in accordance with the terms of the lease relating to its amendment. The PHA must redetermine reasonable rent, in accordance with § 983.303(c), based on any change in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant, and the redetermined reasonable rent shall be used in calculation of rent to owner from the effective date of the change.
(f)
Term of lease.
(1) The initial lease term must be for at least one year.
(2) The lease must provide for automatic renewal after the initial term of the lease. The lease may provide either:

Owner termination of tenancy and eviction.
24 CFR 982.310 of this title applies with the exception that 24 CFR 982.310(d)(1)(iii) and (iv) does not apply to the PBV program. (In the PBV program, “good cause” does not include a business or economic reason or desire
to use the unit for an individual, family, or non-residential rental purpose.) In addition, the owner may terminate the tenancy in accordance with the requirements related to lease terminations for development activity on units under a HAP contract as provided in § 983.157(g)(6)(iii) and for substantial improvement to units under a HAP contract as provided in § 983.212(a)(3)(iii). 24 CFR 5.858 through 5.861 on eviction for drug and alcohol abuse and 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to the PBV program.

§ 983.258
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
Housing assistance payments shall continue until the tenant rent equals the rent to owner. The cessation of housing assistance payments at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such cessation preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances if such changes occur within 180 days following the date of the last housing assistance payment by the PHA. After the 180-day period, the unit shall be removed from the HAP contract pursuant to § 983.211.

(d)
Security deposit reimbursement to owner.
The owner must give the tenant a written list of all items charged against the security deposit and the amount of each item. After deducting the amount used to reimburse the owner, the owner must promptly refund the full amount of the balance to the tenant.
(e)
Insufficiency of security deposit.

§ 983.260
Overcrowded, under-occupied, and accessible units.
(a)
Family occupancy of wrong-size or accessible unit.
(1) The PHA subsidy standards determine the appropriate unit size for the family size and composition.
(2) If the PHA determines that a family is occupying a wrong-size unit, or a unit with accessibility features that the family does not require and the unit is needed by a family that requires the accessibility features (see 24 CFR 8.27), the PHA must:
(i) Within 30 days from the PHA's determination, notify the family and the owner of this determination; and
(ii) Within 60 days from the PHA's determination, offer the family continued housing assistance, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
PHA offer of continued assistance.
(1) The PHA policy on continued housing assistance must be stated in the Administrative Plan and may be in the form of:
(i) PBV assistance in an appropriate-size unit (in the same project or in another project);
(ii) Other project-based housing assistance (
e.g.,
by occupancy of a public housing unit);
(iii) Tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program; or
(iv) Other comparable tenant-based rental assistance.
(2) If no continued housing assistance as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is available, the PHA must remove the wrong-size or accessible unit from the HAP contract to make voucher assistance available to issue the family a tenant-based voucher. Section 983.206(b) does not apply to families issued a tenant-based voucher under the circumstance described in this paragraph (b)(2).
(c)
PHA termination of housing assistance payments.
(1) If the PHA offers the family the opportunity to receive tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program:
(i) The PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for a wrong-sized or accessible unit at the earlier of the expiration of the term of the family's voucher (including any extension granted by the PHA) or the date upon which the family vacates the unit.
(ii) If the family does not move out of the wrong-sized unit or accessible unit by the expiration date of the term of the family's voucher, the PHA must remove the unit from the HAP contract.
(2) If the PHA offers the family another form of continued housing assistance (other than tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program), in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for the wrong-sized or accessible unit and remove the unit from the HAP contract when:
(i) In the case of an offer by the PHA of PBV assistance or other project-based housing assistance in an appropriate-size unit, the family does not accept the offer and does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days. The family may request and the PHA may grant one extension not to exceed up to an additional 90 days to accommodate the family's efforts to locate affordable, safe, and geographically proximate replacement housing.
(ii) In the case of an offer by the PHA of PBV assistance or other project-based housing assistance in an appropriate size unit, the family accepts the offer but does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days.
(iii) In the case of an offer by the PHA of other comparable tenant-based rental assistance, the family either accepts or does not accept the offer but does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, not to exceed 90 days. The family may request and the PHA may grant one extension not to exceed up to an additional 90 days to accommodate the family's efforts to locate, affordable, safe, and geographically proximate replacement housing.
(d)
Reinstatement.
The PHA may reinstate a unit removed under paragraph (b)(2), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2) of this section to the HAP contract after the family vacates the property, in accordance with § 983.207(b).
[89 FR 38334, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.261
Family right to move.
(a)
Termination of assisted lease after one year.
The family may terminate the assisted lease at any time after one year of PBV assistance. The family must give the owner advance written notice of intent to vacate (with a copy to the PHA) in accordance with the lease.
(b)
Continued assistance.
If the family has elected to terminate the lease in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA must offer the family the opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. The PHA must specify in the Administrative Plan whether it will offer families assistance under the voucher program or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance. If voucher assistance is offered to the family and the search term expires, the PHA must issue the voucher to the next eligible family.
(c)
Contacting the PHA.
Before providing notice to terminate the lease under
paragraph (a)
of this section, a family must contact the PHA to request a voucher or comparable tenant-based rental assistance if the family wishes to move with continued assistance. If a voucher or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance is not immediately available to the family upon the family's request to the PHA, the PHA must give the family priority
to receive the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance. The PHA must describe in its Administrative Plan its policies and procedures for how the family must contact the PHA and how the PHA documents families waiting for continued tenant-based rental assistance.
(d)
Termination of assisted lease before one year.
If the family terminates the assisted lease before one year of PBV assistance, the family relinquishes the opportunity for continued tenant-based assistance under this section.
(e)
Notice exclusion.
When the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, the family is not required to give the owner advance written notice or contact the PHA under paragraph (a) and (c), respectively, of this section before moving from the unit. Additionally, when any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move, the family is not required to give the owner advance written notice or contact the PHA under paragraph (a) and (c), respectively, of this section before moving from the unit. A PHA may not terminate the assistance of a family due to a move occurring under the circumstances in this paragraph (e) and must offer the family the opportunity for continued tenant-based assistance if the family had received at least one year of PBV assistance prior to moving.
(f)
Emergency Transfer Plans.
In the case of a move due to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, PHAs must describe policies for facilitating emergency transfers for families with PBV assistance in their Emergency Transfer Plan, consistent with the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including when the victim has received PBV assistance for less than one year and is not eligible for continued assistance under § 983.261(b).
(g)
Family break-up.
If a family break-up results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance in accordance with 24 CFR 982.315(a)(2).
[89 FR 38335, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.262
Occupancy of units under the increased program cap and project cap excepted units.
(a)
General.
Pursuant to § 983.6(a), a PHA may commit project-based assistance to no more than 20 percent of its authorized voucher units at the time of commitment. There are certain units eligible for an increased program cap as described in § 983.6(d). Pursuant to § 983.54(a), the PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance or place units under an Agreement or a HAP contract in excess of the project cap. There are certain exceptions to the project cap as described in § 983.54(c). This section provides more detail on the occupancy requirements of both the excepted units from the project cap under § 983.54(c)(2) and units under the increased program cap under § 983.6(d).
(b)
Requirements applicable to both excepted units and units under an increased program cap.
(1) The unit must be occupied by a family who meets the applicable exception.
(2) The family must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program through an admissions preference (see § 983.251).
(3) Once the family vacates the unit, the unit must be made available to and occupied by a family that meets the applicable exception.
(4) The PHA must specify in its Administrative Plan which of the options below the PHA will take if a unit is no longer qualified for its excepted status or the increased program cap:
(i) Substitute the unit for another unit if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(a), so that the overall number of excepted units or units under the increased program cap in the project is not reduced. A PHA may, in conjunction with such substitution,
add the original unit to the HAP contract if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(b), including that such addition does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.
(ii) Remove the unit from the PBV HAP contract. In conjunction with the removal, the PHA may provide the family with tenant-based assistance, if the family is eligible for tenant-based assistance. The family and the owner may agree to use the tenant-based voucher in the unit; otherwise, the family must move from the unit with the tenant-based voucher. If the family later vacates the unit, the PHA may add the unit to the PBV HAP contract in accordance with § 983.207.
(iii) Change the unit's status under the project cap or program cap, as applicable, provided that the change does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.
(c)
Requirements for units under the increased program cap
—(1)
Homeless family.
A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(i) if the family meets the definition of homeless under Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302), included in 24 CFR 578.3, at the time the family first occupies the unit.
(2)
Veteran family.
A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(ii) if the family is comprised of or includes a veteran (a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom) at the time the family first occupies the unit.
(3)
Supportive housing for persons with disabilities or elderly persons.
The following applies to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(1)(iii):
(i) A disabled or elderly member of the family must be eligible for one or more of the supportive services at the time the family first occupies the unit. The member of the family may choose not to participate in the services.
(ii) The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for supportive housing for persons with disabilities or elderly persons to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (
e.g.,
death of the elderly family member or family member with a disability or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member or family member with a disability no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count under the increased program cap category for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit no longer counts under the increased program cap category and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(4)
Units for Family Unification Program (FUP) youth.
See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2).

Requirements for project cap excepted units
—(1)
Elderly family.
A unit under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(i) must be occupied by an elderly family, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403. The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for occupancy of an excepted unit based on elderly family status to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (
e.g.,
death of the elderly family member or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit is no longer considered excepted and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(2)
Disabled family.
The same provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply to units previously excepted
based on disabled family status under a HAP contract in effect prior to April 18, 2017.
(3)
Supportive services.
The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(iii):
(i) A unit is excepted if any member of the family is eligible for one or more of the supportive services even if the family chooses not to participate in the services.
(ii) If any member of the family chooses to participate and successfully completes the supportive services, the unit continues to be excepted for as long as any member of the family resides in the unit, even if the members that continue to reside in the unit are ineligible during tenancy for all available supportive services.
(iii) The unit loses its excepted status only if the entire family becomes ineligible during the tenancy for all supportive services available to the family. This provision does not apply where any member of the family has successfully completed the supportive services under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iv) A family cannot be terminated from the program or evicted from the unit because they become ineligible for all supportive services during the tenancy.
(4)
Units for FUP youth.
See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii).
(e)
Requirements for units for FUP youth under the increased program cap and project cap exception.
The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii) and the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2):
(1) A unit is excepted from the project cap or qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the unit is occupied by an eligible youth receiving FUP assistance.
(2) The youth must vacate the unit once the FUP assistance has expired. The unit loses its excepted status or no longer qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the youth does not move from the unit upon the expiration of the FUP assistance.

Amount of rent to owner.
Except for certain tax credit units as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:
(1) An amount determined by the PHA in accordance with the Administrative Plan not to exceed 110 percent of the applicable fair market rent (or the amount of any applicable exception payment standard) for the unit bedroom size minus any utility allowance;

(ii) The contract unit is not located in a qualified census tract;
(iii) In the same building, there are comparable tax credit units of the same unit bedroom size as the contract unit and the comparable tax credit units do not have any form of rental assistance other than the tax credit; and
(iv) The tax credit rent exceeds the applicable fair market rental (or any exception payment standard) as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) In the case of a contract unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:
(i) An amount determined by the PHA in accordance with the Administrative Plan, not to exceed the tax credit rent minus any utility allowance;

e.g.
, additional assistance such as tenant-based voucher assistance).
(4) A “qualified census tract” is any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Bureau of the Census) in which:
(i) At least 50 percent of households have an income of less than 60 percent of Area Median Gross Income (AMGI); or

Rent to owner for other tax credit units.
Except in the case of a tax-credit unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner for all other tax credit units may be determined by the PHA pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Reasonable rent.
The PHA shall determine the reasonable rent in accordance with § 983.303. The rent to the owner for each contract unit may at no time exceed the reasonable rent, except in cases where, the PHA has elected within the HAP contract not to reduce rents below the initial rent to owner and, upon redetermination of the rent to owner, the reasonable rent would result in a rent below the initial rent. If the PHA has not elected within the HAP contract to establish the initial rent to owner as the rent floor, the rent to owner shall not at any time exceed the reasonable rent.
(f)
Use of FMRs and utility allowance schedule in determining the amount of rent to owner.
(1) When determining the initial rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR in effect and the utility allowance schedule in effect at execution of the HAP contract. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the beginning date of the HAP contract.
(2) When redetermining the rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR and the PHA utility allowance schedule in effect at the time of redetermination. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the redetermination date.
(3)(i) For PBV projects that are not located in a designated SAFMR area under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1), or for PBV projects not located in a ZIP code where the PHA has opted in under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3), any exception payment standard amount approved under 24 CFR 982.503(d)(2)-(4) applies for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(iv) of this section. HUD will not approve a different payment standard amount for use in the PBV program.
(ii) For PBV projects that are located in a designated SAFMR area under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(1), or for PBV projects located in a ZIP code where the PHA has opted in under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3), an exception payment standard amount approved under 24 CFR 982.503(d)(3)-(4) will apply for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if the PHA has adopted a policy applying SAFMRs to its PBV program and met all other requirements in accordance with 24 CFR 888.113(h).
(4) HUD may establish a process allowing PHAs to adopt project-specific utility allowances by notification in the
Federal Register
subject to public comment. Absent the establishment of such a project-specific utility allowance, the PHA's utility allowance schedule as determined under 24 CFR 982.517(b)(2)(i) or (ii) applies to both the tenant-based and PBV programs.
(5) The PHA must continue to use the applicable utility allowance schedule for the purpose of determining the initial rent to owner and redetermining the rent to owner for contract units, as outlined in this 24 CFR 983.301, regardless of whether the PHA approves a
higher utility allowance as a reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities living in a contract unit (see 24 CFR 982.517(e)).
(g)
PHA-owned units.
For PHA-owned PBV units, the initial rent to owner and the annual redetermination of rent at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract must be determined by the independent entity approved by HUD in accordance with § 983.57. The PHA must use the rent to owner established by the independent entity.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36169, June 25, 2014; 81 FR 80583, Nov. 16, 2016; 89 FR 38336, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.302
Redetermination of rent to owner.
(a)
Requirement to redetermine the rent to owner.
The PHA must redetermine the rent to owner:
(1) When there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR;
(2) Upon the owner's request consistent with requirements established in the PHA's Administrative Plan. The Administrative Plan must specify any advance notice the owner must give the PHA and the form the request must take; or
(3) At the time of the automatic adjustment by an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).
(b)
Rent increase.
(1) An owner may receive an increase in the rent to owner during the term of a HAP contract. Any such increase will go into effect at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract. (Provisions for special adjustments of contract rent pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(2)(B) do not apply to the voucher program.)
(2) A rent increase may occur through automatic adjustment by an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) or as the result of an owner request for such an increase. A rent increase as the result of an owner request must be determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable. A rent increase through an adjustment by an OCAF is likewise subject to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, except there is no rent request by the owner to take into account since the PHA redetermines the rent automatically under that option.
(3) By agreement of the parties, the HAP contract may provide for rent adjustments using an operating cost adjustment factor (OCAF) established by the Secretary pursuant to Section 524(c) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 at each annual anniversary of the HAP contract. OCAFs are established by the Secretary and published annually in the
Federal Register.
The provisions in the following paragraphs apply to a contract that provides for rent adjustments using an OCAF:
(i) The contract may require an additional increase up to an amount determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, if requested by the owner in writing, periodically during the term of the contract.
(ii) The contract shall require an additional increase up to an amount determined by the PHA pursuant to § 983.301(b) or (c), as applicable, at the point of contract extension, if requested by the owner in writing.
(4) If the HAP contract does not provide for automatic adjustment by an OCAF, then an owner who wishes to receive an increase in the rent to owner must request such an increase at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract by written notice to the PHA.
(5) The PHA must establish the length of the required notice period for any rent increase that requires a written request from the owner. The written request must be submitted as required by the PHA (
e.g.,
to a particular mailing address or email address).
(6) The PHA may not approve and the owner may not receive any increase of rent to owner until and unless the owner has complied with all requirements of the HAP contract, including compliance with the HQS (except that HQS compliance is not required for purposes of this provision for units undergoing development activity that complies with § 983.157 or substantial improvement that complies with § 983.212). The owner may not receive any retroactive increase of rent for any period of noncompliance.
(c)
Rent decrease.
(1) If the HAP contract provides for rent adjustments by an OCAF and there is a decrease in the
fair market rent, tax credit rent, or reasonable rent that requires a decrease to the rent to owner (see paragraph (b)(2)), the rent to owner must be decreased. If the HAP contract does not provide for adjustment by an OCAF and there is a decrease in the rent to owner, as established in accordance with § 983.301, the rent to owner must be decreased, regardless of whether the owner requests a rent adjustment.
(2) At any time during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA may elect within the HAP contract to not reduce rents below the initial rent to owner. Where a PHA makes such an election, the rent to owner shall not be reduced below the initial rent to owner, except:
(i) To correct errors in calculations in accordance with HUD requirements;
(ii) If additional housing assistance has been combined with PBV assistance after the execution of the initial HAP contract and a rent decrease is required pursuant to § 983.153(b); or
(iii) If a decrease in rent to owner is required based on changes in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant.
(d)
Notice of change in rent to owner.
Whenever there is a change in rent to owner, the PHA must provide written notice to the owner specifying the amount of the new rent to owner (as determined in accordance with §§ 983.301 and 983.302). The PHA notice of the rent change in rent to owner constitutes an amendment of the rent to owner specified in the HAP contract.
(e)
Contract year and annual anniversary of the HAP contract.
(1) The contract year is the period of 12 calendar months preceding each annual anniversary of the HAP contract during the HAP contract term. The initial contract year is calculated from the first day of the first calendar month of the HAP contract term.
(2) The annual anniversary of the HAP contract is the first day of the first calendar month after the end of the preceding contract year. The adjusted rent to owner amount applies for the period of 12 calendar months from the annual anniversary of the HAP contract.
(3) The annual anniversary of the HAP contract for contract units completed in stages must follow § 983.207(g).
[89 FR 38337, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.303
Reasonable rent.
(a)
Comparability requirement.
At all times during the term of the HAP contract, the rent to the owner for a contract unit may not exceed the reasonable rent as determined by the PHA, except that where the PHA has elected in the HAP contract to not reduce rents below the initial rent under the initial HAP contract, the rent to owner shall not be reduced below the initial rent in accordance with § 983.302(c)(2).
(b)
Redetermination.
The PHA must redetermine the reasonable rent:
(1) Whenever there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the contract anniversary (for the unit sizes specified in the HAP contract) as compared with the FMR in effect 1 year before the contract anniversary.
(2) Whenever the PHA approves a change in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant;
(3) Whenever the HAP contract is amended to add a contract unit or substitute a different contract unit in the same building or project;
(4) Whenever the PHA accepts a completed unit after development activity that is conducted after HAP contract execution (see § 983.156(b)(3)); and
(5) Whenever there is any other change that may substantially affect the reasonable rent.
(c)
How to determine reasonable rent.
(1) The reasonable rent of a contract unit must be determined by comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units.
(2) In determining the reasonable rent, the PHA must consider factors that affect market rent, such as:
(i) The location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the contract unit; and
(ii) Amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the owner.
(3) The reasonable rent determination must be based on the condition of the assisted unit at the time of the determination and not on anticipated future unit conditions.
(d)
Comparability analysis.
(1) For each unit, the PHA comparability analysis must use at least three comparable units in the private unassisted market, which may include comparable unassisted units in the premises or project.
(2) The PHA must retain a comparability analysis that shows how the reasonable rent was determined, including major differences between the contract units and comparable unassisted units.
(3) The comparability analysis may be performed by PHA staff or by another qualified person or entity. A person or entity that conducts the comparability analysis and any PHA staff or contractor engaged in determining the housing assistance payment based on the comparability analysis may not have any direct or indirect interest in the property.
(e)
Owner certification of comparability.
By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.
(f)
Determining reasonable rent for PHA-owned units.
(1) For PHA-owned units, the amount of the reasonable rent must be determined by an independent entity in accordance with § 983.57, rather than by the PHA. The reasonable rent must be determined in accordance with this section.
(2) The independent entity must furnish a copy of the independent entity determination of reasonable rent for PHA-owned units to the PHA.

(f)
Prohibition of other subsidy.
For provisions that prohibit PBV assistance to units in certain types of subsidized housing, see § 983.54.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 65207, Nov. 19, 2007; 79 FR 36170, June 25, 2014]
§ 983.305
Rent to owner: effect of rent control and other rent limits.
In addition to the limitation to 110 percent of the FMR in § 983.301(b)(1), the rent reasonableness limit under §§ 983.301(b)(2) and 983.303, the rental determination provisions of § 983.301(f), the special limitations for tax credit units under § 983.301(c), and other rent limits under this part, the amount of rent to owner also may be subject to rent control or other limits under local, state, or federal law.

Calculating amount of payment.
The monthly housing assistance payment by the PHA to the owner for a contract unit leased to a family is the rent to owner minus the tenant rent (total tenant payment minus the utility allowance).
(d)
Prompt payment.
The housing assistance payment by the PHA to the owner under the HAP contract must be paid to the owner on or about the first day of the month for which payment is due, unless the owner and the PHA agree on a later date.
(e)
Owner compliance with contract.
To receive housing assistance payments in accordance with the HAP contract, the owner must comply with all the provisions of the HAP contract. Unless the owner complies with all the provisions of the HAP contract, the owner does not have a right to receive housing assistance payments.
§ 983.352
Vacancy payment.
(a)
Payment for move-out month.
If an assisted family moves out of the unit, the owner may keep the housing assistance payment payable for the calendar month when the family moves out (“move-out month”). However, the owner may not keep the payment if the PHA determines that the vacancy is the owner's fault.
(b)
Vacancy payment at PHA discretion.
(1) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may provide for vacancy payments to the owner (in the amounts determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for a PHA-determined period of vacancy extending from the beginning of the first calendar month after the move-out month for a period not exceeding two full months following the move-out month.The PHA must include in its Administrative Plan the PHA's policy on the conditions under which it will allow vacancy payments in a HAP contract, the duration of the payments, amount of vacancy payments it will make to an owner, and the required form and manner of requests for vacancy payments, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(2) The vacancy payment to the owner for each month of the maximum two-month period will be determined by the PHA, and cannot exceed the monthly rent to owner under the assisted lease, minus any portion of the rental payment received by the owner (including amounts available from the tenant's security deposit). Any vacancy payment may cover only the period the unit remains vacant.
(3) The PHA may make vacancy payments to the owner only if:
(i) The owner gives the PHA prompt, written notice certifying that the family has vacated the unit and containing the date when the family moved out (to the best of the owner's knowledge and belief);
(ii) The owner certifies that the vacancy is not the fault of the owner and that the unit was vacant during the period for which payment is claimed;
(iii) The owner certifies that it has taken every reasonable action to minimize the likelihood and length of vacancy; and
(iv) The owner provides any additional information required and requested by the PHA to verify that the owner is entitled to the vacancy payment.
(4) The owner must submit a request for vacancy payments in the form and
manner required by the PHA and must provide any information or substantiation required by the PHA to determine the amount of any vacancy payment.

(b)
Tenant payment to owner.
(1) The family is responsible for paying the tenant rent (total tenant payment minus the utility allowance).
(2) The amount of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA is the maximum amount the owner may charge the family for rent of a contract unit. The tenant rent is payment for all housing services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities to be provided by the owner without additional charge to the tenant, in accordance with the HAP contract and lease.
(3) The owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA. The owner must immediately return any excess payment to the tenant.
(4) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the tenancy of an assisted family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.
(c)
Limit of PHA responsibility.
(1) The PHA is responsible only for making housing assistance payments to the owner on behalf of a family in accordance with the HAP contract. The PHA is not responsible for paying the tenant rent, or for paying any other claim by the owner.
(2) The PHA may not use housing assistance payments or other program funds (including any administrative fee reserve) to pay any part of the tenant rent or to pay any other claim by the owner. The PHA may not make any payment to the owner for any damage to the unit, or for any other amount owed by a family under the family's lease or otherwise.
(d)
Utility reimbursement.
(1) If the amount of the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, the PHA shall pay the amount of such excess as a reimbursement for tenant-paid utilities (“utility reimbursement”) and the tenant rent to the owner shall be zero.

(3) If the PHA chooses to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.
[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 89 FR 38338, May 7, 2024]
§ 983.354
Other fees and charges.
(a)
Meals and supportive services.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner may not require the tenant or family members to pay charges for meals or supportive services. Non-payment of such charges is not grounds for termination of tenancy.
(2) In assisted living developments receiving project-based assistance, owners may charge tenants, family members, or both for meals or supportive services. These charges may not be included in the rent to owner, nor may the value of meals and supportive services be included in the calculation of reasonable rent. Non-payment of such charges is grounds for termination of the lease by the owner in an assisted living development.
(b)
Other charges by owner.
The owner may not charge the tenant or family members extra amounts for items customarily included in rent in the locality or provided at no additional cost to unsubsidized tenants in the premises.

# Subpart A—General
§ 984.101
Purpose, applicability, and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
(1) The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD or Department) assistance with public and private resources, to enable families eligible to receive HUD assistance to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.
(2) The purpose of this part is to implement the policies and procedures applicable to operation of an FSS program, as established under section 23 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437u).
(b)
Applicability.
This part applies to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administering a public housing program under section 9, a project-based and/or tenant-based assistance program under section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) homeownership program under section 8(y) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, or Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for low-income families and Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy for homeless individuals under 24 CFR part 882. See part 887 of this title for program regulations applicable to owners of multifamily assisted housing.
(c)
Scope.
Each PHA that administers an FSS program must do so in accordance with the requirements of this part. See § 984.105 for more information concerning PHAs that are required to administer an FSS program.
(d)
Non-participation.
Participation in an FSS program is voluntary. A family's admission to the public housing or Section 8 programs cannot be conditioned on participation in FSS. A family's housing assistance cannot be terminated by reason of such election or due to an FSS family's failure to comply with FSS program requirements in this part.
§ 984.102
Program objectives.
The objective of the FSS program is to reduce the dependency of low-income families on welfare assistance and housing subsidies. Under the FSS program, HUD assisted families are provided opportunities for education, job training, counseling, and other forms of social service assistance, while living in assisted housing, so that they may obtain the education, employment, and business and social skills necessary to achieve self-sufficiency, as defined in § 984.103. The Department will evaluate the performance of a PHA's or owner's FSS program using a scoring system that measures criteria, such as graduation from the program, increased earned income, and program participation, as provided by HUD through a
Federal Register
notice.

section. Aside from the goals specifically required in this section, PHAs or owners must work with each participant to establish realistic and individualized goals and may not include additional mandatory goals or mandatory modifications of the two mandatory goals.
(3)
Compliance with lease terms.
The CoP shall provide that one of the obligations of the FSS family is to comply with the terms and conditions of the respective public housing or Section 8 lease. However, all considerations allowed for other assisted residents for repayment agreements, etc., shall also be allowed for FSS participants.
(4)
Employment obligation
—(i)
Minimum requirement.
Although all members of the FSS family may seek and maintain suitable employment during the term of the contract, only the head of FSS family shall be required under the CoP to seek and maintain suitable employment during the term of the contract and any extension thereof.
(ii)
Seek employment.
The obligation to seek employment means searching for jobs, applying for employment, attending job interviews, and otherwise following through on employment opportunities.
(iii)
Determination of suitable employment.
A determination of suitable employment shall be made by the PHA or owner, with the agreement of the affected participant, based on the skills, education, job training, and receipt of other benefits of the household member, and based on the available job opportunities within the jurisdiction served by the PHA or in the community where the PBRA property is located.
(5)
Consequences of noncompliance with the contract.
The CoP shall specify the consequences of noncompliance with the CoP as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(c)
Contract of Participation term.
The CoP shall state that each FSS family will be required to fulfill CoP obligations no later than 5 years after the first re-examination of income after the execution date of the CoP.
(d)
Contract of Participation extension.
The PHA or owner shall, in writing, extend the term of the CoP for a period not to exceed two (2) years for any FSS family that requests, in writing, an extension of the contract, provided that the PHA or owner finds that good cause exists for granting the extension. The family's written request for an extension must include a description of the need for the extension. Extension of the CoP will entitle the FSS family to continue to have amounts credited to the family's FSS escrow account in accordance with § 984.304. As used in this paragraph (d),
good cause
means:
(1) Circumstances beyond the control of the FSS family that impede the family's ability to complete the CoP obligations, as determined by the PHA or owner, such as a serious illness or involuntary loss of employment;
(2) Active pursuit of a current or additional goal that will result in furtherance of self-sufficiency during the period of the extension (
e.g.,
completion of a college degree during which the participant is unemployed or under-employed, credit repair towards being homeownership ready, etc.) as determined by the PHA or owner; or
(3) Any other circumstance that the PHA or owner determines warrants an extension, as long as the PHA or owner is consistent in its determination as to which circumstances warrant an extension.
(e)
Unavailability of supportive services
—(1)
Good-faith effort to replace unavailable services.
If a social service agency fails to deliver the supportive services identified in an FSS family member's ITSP, the PHA or owner shall make a good faith effort to obtain these services from another agency.
(2)
Assessment of necessity of services.
If the PHA or owner is unable to obtain the services from another agency, the PHA or owner shall reassess the family member's needs and determine whether other available services would achieve the same purpose. If other available services would not achieve the same purpose, the PHA or owner and the family shall determine whether the unavailable services are integral to the FSS family's advancement or progress toward self-sufficiency. If the unavailable services are:
(i) Determined not to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency, the PHA or owner shall revise the ITSP to delete these
services, and modify the CoP to remove any obligation on the part of the FSS family to accept the unavailable services, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; or,
(ii) Determined to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency, the PHA or owner shall terminate the CoP and follow the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section regarding FSS escrow disbursement.
(f)
Modification.
The PHA or owner and the FSS family may mutually agree to modify the CoP with respect to the ITSP and/or the contract term in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and/or designation of the head of FSS family. Modifications must be in writing.
(g)
Completion of the contract.
The CoP is considered to be completed, and a family's participation in the FSS program is considered to be concluded when the FSS family has fulfilled all of its obligations under the CoP, including all family members' ITSPs, on or before the expiration of the contract term, including any extension thereof.
(h)
Termination of the contract.
The CoP shall be terminated if the family's housing assistance is terminated in accordance with HUD requirements. The CoP may be terminated before the expiration of the contract term, and any extension thereof, by:
(1) Mutual consent of the parties;
(2) The failure of the FSS family to meet its obligations under the CoP without good cause. This includes an FSS family who has moved out of multifamily assisted housing and families receiving tenant-based assistance under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act who fail to comply with the contract requirements because the family has moved outside the jurisdiction of the PHA, and the PHA has not determined that there is good cause terminate the CoP with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section;
(3) The family's withdrawal from the FSS program;
(4) Such other act as is deemed inconsistent with the purpose of the FSS program; or
(5) Operation of law.
(i)
Option to terminate FSS participation or withhold the coordination of supportive service assistance.
The PHA or owner may withhold the coordination of supportive services or terminate the FSS family's participation in the FSS program, if the PHA or owner determines, in accordance with the FSS Action Plan hearing procedures, that the FSS family has failed to comply without good cause with the requirements of the CoP in accordance with this section.
(j)
Transitional supportive service assistance.
A PHA or owner may continue to offer to a former FSS family that has completed its CoP, appropriate coordination of those FSS supportive services needed to become self-sufficient if the family still resides in public housing or Section 8 housing. If the family no longer resides in public housing, Section 8, or other assisted housing, then a PHA or owner may continue to coordinate supportive services for a former FSS family that completed its CoP using only funding sources that are not HUD funds or HUD-restricted funds.
(k)
Termination with FSS escrow disbursement.
(1) The CoP is will be terminated with FSS disbursement when:
(i) Services that the PHA or owner and the FSS family have agreed are integral to the FSS family's advancement towards self-sufficiency are unavailable, as described in paragraph (e) of this section;
(ii) The head of the FSS family becomes permanently disabled and unable to work during the period of the contract, unless the PHA or owner and the FSS family determine that it is possible to modify the contract to designate a new head of the FSS family; or
(iii) An FSS family in good standing moves outside the jurisdiction of the PHA (in accordance with portability requirements at § 982.353 of this chapter) for good cause, as determined by the PHA, and continuation of the CoP after the move, or completion of the CoP prior to the move, is not possible. PHAs must be consistent in their determinations of whether a family has good cause for a termination with FSS escrow disbursement under this paragraph (k).
(2) Upon termination of a CoP pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section, escrow funds must be handled consistent with § 984.305.
§ 984.304
Amount of rent paid by FSS family and increases in family income.
(a)
Amount of rent paid by FSS family.
The amount of rent paid by an FSS family is determined in accordance with the requirements of the applicable housing assistance program as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Public housing program: Calculation of total tenant payment.
Total tenant payment for an FSS family participating in the FSS program is determined in accordance with the regulations set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart F.
(2)
Section 8 programs: Calculation of rent.
(i) For the HCV program, rent is determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 982, subpart K; and
(ii) For the PBV program, rent is determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 983, subpart G.
(b)
Increases in FSS family income.
Any increase in the earned income of an FSS family during its participation in an FSS program may not be considered as income or an asset for purposes of eligibility of the FSS family under any other program administered by HUD.
§ 984.305
FSS escrow account.
(a)
Establishment of FSS escrow account
—(1)
General.
The PHA or owner shall deposit the FSS escrow account funds of all families participating in an FSS program into a single interest-bearing depository account. The PHA or owner must deposit the FSS escrow account funds in one or more of the HUD-approved investments. The depository account may be part of the PHA's or owner's overall accounts or a separate account, as long as it is in compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. During the term of the CoP, the FSS escrow account credit amount shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section at each re-examination of income occurring after the effective date of the CoP. Such escrow credit amount must be deposited each month by the PHA or owner to each family's FSS escrow account within the PHA's or owner's depository account.
(2)
Accounting for FSS escrow account funds
—(i)
Accounting records.
The total of the combined FSS escrow account funds will be supported in the accounting records by a subsidiary ledger showing the balance applicable to each FSS family.
(ii)
Proration of investment income.
The investment income for funds in the FSS escrow account must be prorated and credited to each family's FSS escrow account based on the balance in each family's FSS escrow account at the end of the period for which the investment income is credited.
(iii)
Reduction of amounts due by FSS family.
If the FSS family has not paid the family contribution towards rent, or other amounts, if any, due under the public housing or Section 8-assisted lease, the balance in the family's FSS account shall be reduced by that amount (as determined by the owner or reported by the owner to the PHA in the Section 8(o) programs) at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the FSS family has been found to have under-reported income after the baseline annual earned income was set, the amount credited to the FSS escrow account will be based on the income amounts originally reported by the FSS family. If the FSS family is found to have under-reported income in the re-examination used to set the baseline, the escrow for the entire period of the CoP will be re-calculated using the correct income to set the baseline and then calculate subsequent escrow amounts.
(3)
Reporting on FSS escrow account.
Each PHA or owner will be required to make a report, at least once annually, to each FSS family on the status of the family's FSS escrow account. At a minimum, the report will include:
(i) The balance at the beginning of the reporting period;
(ii) The amount of the family's rent payment that was credited to the FSS escrow account, during the reporting period;
(iii) Any deductions made from the account at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds (see paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section) for amounts due the PHA or owner;
(iv) The amount of interest earned on the account during the year; and
(v) The total in the account at the end of the reporting period.
(b)
FSS credit
—(1)
Determining the family's baseline information.
When determining the family's baseline annual earned income and the baseline monthly rent amounts for purposes of computing the FSS escrow credit, the PHA or owner must use the amounts on the family's last income re-examination.
(2)
Computation of amount.
The FSS credit amount shall be the lower of:
(i) Thirty (30) percent of one-twelfth (
1/12
) (
i.e.,
two and a half (2.5) percent) of the amount by which the family's current annual earned income exceeds the family's baseline annual earned income; or
(ii) The increase in the family's monthly rent. The increase in the family's monthly rent shall be the lower of:
(A) The amount by which the family's current monthly rent exceeds the family's baseline monthly rent;
(B) For HCV families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent (
i.e.,
rent to owner plus any utility allowance) or the payment standard, whichever is lower; or
(C) For PBV, Mod Rehab, including Mod Rehab SRO, and PBRA families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent (
i.e.,
rent to owner or contract rent, as applicable, plus any utility allowance).
(3)
Ineligibility for FSS credit.
FSS families who are not low-income families (
i.e.,
whose adjusted annual income exceeds eighty (80) percent of the area median income) shall not be entitled to any FSS credit.
(4)
Cessation of FSS credit.
The PHA or owner shall not make additional credits to the FSS family's FSS escrow account:
(i) When the FSS family has completed the CoP, as described in § 984.303(g);
(ii) When the CoP is terminated; or
(iii) During the time an HCV family is in the process of moving to a new unit, in accordance with HCV program requirements in part 982 of this title, and is not under a lease.
(c)
Disbursement of FSS escrow account funds
—(1)
General.
The amount in an FSS escrow account in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family when the CoP has been completed as provided in § 984.303(g), and if, at the time of contract completion, the head of FSS family submits to the PHA or owner a certification, as defined in § 984.103, that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance.
(2)
Disbursement before expiration of contract term.
(i) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled its obligations under the CoP before the expiration of the contract term, and the head of FSS family submits a certification that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance, the amount in the family's FSS escrow account, in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family.
(ii) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled certain interim goals established in the CoP and needs a portion of the FSS escrow account funds for purposes consistent with or in support of the CoP, such as completion of higher education (
i.e.,
college, graduate school), job training, or to meet start-up expenses involved in creation of a small business, the PHA or owner may, at the PHA's or owner's sole discretion, disburse a portion of the funds from the family's FSS escrow account to assist the family in paying those expenses. Unless the interim disbursement was made based on fraudulent information from the family, the family is not required to repay such interim disbursements if the family does not complete the CoP.
(3)
Disbursement in cases of termination of the CoP with disbursement of escrow.
The PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, under circumstances in which HUD has determined good cause is warranted. HUD determines that there is good cause when a CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k). Therefore, if the CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k), the PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as of the effective date of the termination of the contract.
(4)
Verification of family certification.
Before disbursement of the FSS escrow account funds to the family, the PHA or owner may verify that the FSS family is no longer a recipient of welfare assistance by requesting copies of any documents which may indicate whether the family is receiving any welfare assistance and by contacting welfare agencies.
(d)
Succession of FSS escrow account.
If the head of FSS family ceases to reside with other family members in the public housing or the Section 8-assisted unit, the remaining members of the FSS family, after consultation with the PHA or owner, shall have the right to take over the CoP or designate another family member to receive the funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Use of FSS escrow account funds for homeownership.
An FSS family may use disbursed FSS escrow account funds, in accordance with § 984.305(c), after final disbursement for the purchase of a home, including the purchase of a home under one of HUD's homeownership programs, or other Federal, State, or local homeownership programs, unless such use is prohibited by the statute or regulations governing the particular homeownership program.
(f)
Forfeiture of FSS escrow account funds
—(1)
Conditions for forfeiture.
Amounts in the FSS escrow account shall be forfeited upon the occurrence of the following:
(i) The CoP is terminated, as provided in § 984.303(h); or,
(ii) The CoP is completed by the family, as provided in § 984.303(g), but the FSS family is receiving welfare assistance at the time the CoP term expires, including any extension thereof.
(2)
Treatment of forfeited FSS escrow account funds.
FSS escrow account funds forfeited by the FSS family must be used by the PHA or owner for the benefit of the FSS participants.
(i) Specifically, such funds may be used for the following eligible activities:
(A) Support for FSS participants in good standing, including, but not limited to, transportation, child care, training, testing fees, employment preparation costs, and other costs related to achieving obligations outlined in the CoP;
(B) Training for FSS Program Coordinator(s); or
(C) Other eligible activities as determined by the Secretary.
(ii) Such funds may not be used for salary and fringe benefits of FSS Program Coordinators; general administrative costs of the FSS program, for housing assistance payments (HAP) expenses or public housing operating funds; or any other activity determined ineligible by the Secretary.
§ 984.306
HCV portability requirements for FSS participants.
(a)
Initial period of CoP
—(1)
First 12 months.
During the first 12 months after the effective date of the FSS CoP, an FSS family may not move outside the jurisdiction of the PHA that first enrolled the family in the FSS program. However, the PHA may approve an FSS family's request to move outside of its jurisdiction under portability (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter) during this period. This paragraph (a)(1) applies to a former PBV family who received tenant-based rental assistance in accordance with § 983.261 of this chapter and exercised their right to move.
(2)
After the first 12 months.
After the first 12 months of the FSS CoP, the FSS family with a tenant-based voucher may move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability regulations (in accordance with § 982.353 of
this chapter). This paragraph (a)(2) applies to former PBV families who received tenant-based rental assistance in accordance with § 983.261 of this chapter and exercised their right to move.
(b)
An FSS family moves to the jurisdiction of a receiving PHA that administers an FSS program.
(1) Whether the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA or absorbs the FSS family into its HCV program, the receiving PHA must enroll an FSS family in good standing in its FSS program; unless
(i) The receiving PHA is already serving the number of FSS families identified in its FSS Action Plan and determines that it does not have the resources to manage the FSS contract; or
(ii) The receiving PHA and the initial PHA agree to the FSS family's continued participation in the initial PHA's FSS program. Prior to the PHAs agreeing to the continued participation, the initial PHA must determine that the relocating FSS family has demonstrated that, notwithstanding the move, it will be able to fulfill its responsibilities under the initial or a modified CoP at its new place of residence. For example, the FSS family may be able to commute to the supportive services specified in the CoP, or the family may move to obtain employment as specified in the contract.
(2) Where continued FSS participation is not possible in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the initial PHA must clearly discuss the options that may be available to the family, depending on the family's specific circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to, modification of the FSS contract, termination of the FSS contract and forfeiture of escrow, termination with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii), or locating a receiving PHA that has the capacity to enroll the family into its FSS program.
(c)
An FSS family moves to the jurisdiction of a receiving PHA that does not administer an FSS program.
If the receiving PHA does not administer an FSS program, the FSS family may not continue participation in the FSS program. The initial PHA must clearly discuss the options that may be available to the family, depending on the family's specific circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to, modification of the FSS contract, termination with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii), termination of the FSS contract and forfeiture of escrow, or locating a receiving PHA that administers an FSS program.
(d)
Single FSS escrow account.
Regardless of whether the FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA or is enrolled in the FSS program of the receiving PHA, the family will have only one FSS escrow account. If the receiving PHA is billing the initial PHA, the account will be maintained by the initial PHA. If an FSS family will be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA will transfer the family's FSS escrow account funds to the receiving PHA and the receiving PHA will maintain the funds in its FSS account.
(e)
FSS program termination; loss of FSS escrow account.
(1) If an FSS family relocates to another jurisdiction, as provided under this section, and is unable to fulfill its obligations under the CoP (or any modifications thereto), the PHA, which is a party to the CoP, must terminate the FSS family from the FSS program, and the family's FSS escrow account will be forfeited. Termination of FSS program participation and forfeiture of FSS escrow must be used only as a last resort, after the PHA determines, in consultation with the family, that the family would be unable to fulfill its obligations under the CoP after the move, that the current CoP cannot be modified to allow for graduation prior to porting, and that the current CoP cannot be terminated with FSS escrow disbursement in accordance with § 984.303(k)(1)(iii). When termination is the only option, the PHA must clearly notify the family that the move will result in the loss of escrow funds.
(2) In the event of forfeiture of the family's FSS escrow account funds, the FSS escrow account funds will revert to the PHA maintaining the FSS escrow account for the family.
(f)
Contract of Participation (CoP).
(1) If the FSS family enrolls in the receiving PHA's FSS program pursuant to
this section, the receiving PHA will enter into a new CoP with the FSS family for the term remaining on the contract with the initial PHA. The initial PHA will terminate its CoP with the family.
(2) If the FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA, pursuant to this section, the CoP executed by the initial PHA will remain as the contract in place.
(g)
New FSS enrollment into the receiving PHA's FSS program
—(1)
Billing.
If the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA, the receiving PHA may, consistent with the receiving PHA's FSS enrollment policies, enroll a family that was not an FSS participant at the initial PHA into its FSS program, provided that the initial PHA manages an FSS program and agrees to such enrollment. If the receiving PHA bills the initial PHA, but the initial PHA does not manage an FSS program, the family may not enroll in the receiving PHA's FSS program.
(2)
Absorption.
If the receiving PHA absorbs the family into its HCV program, the receiving PHA may, consistent with the receiving PHA's FSS enrollment policies, enroll a family that was not an FSS participant at the initial PHA into its FSS program.

# Subpart D—Reporting
§ 984.401
Reporting.
Each PHA or owner that carries out an FSS program shall submit to HUD, in the form prescribed by HUD, a report regarding its FSS program. The report shall include the following information:
(a) A description of the activities carried out under the program;
(b) A description of the effectiveness of the program in assisting families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency, including the number of families enrolled and graduated and the number of established escrow accounts and positive escrow balances;
(c) A description of the effectiveness of the program in coordinating resources of communities to assist families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency; and
(d) Any recommendations by the PHA or owner or the appropriate local Program Coordinating Committee for legislative or administrative action that would improve the FSS program and ensure the effectiveness of the program.

# Subpart A—General
§ 985.1
Purpose and applicability.
(a)
Purpose.
The Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) is designed to assess whether the Section
8 tenant-based assistance programs operate to help eligible families afford decent rental units at the correct subsidy cost. SEMAP also establishes a system for HUD to measure PHA performance in key Section 8 program areas and to assign performance ratings. SEMAP provides procedures for HUD to identify PHA management capabilities and deficiencies in order to target monitoring and program assistance more effectively. PHAs can use the SEMAP performance analysis to assess and improve their own program operations.
(b)
Applicability.
This rule applies to PHA administration of the tenant-based Section 8 rental program (part 982 of this chapter), the project-based voucher program (part 983 of this chapter) to the extent that PBV family and unit data are reported and measured under the stated HUD verification method, and enrollment levels and contributions to escrow accounts for Section 8 participants under the family self-sufficiency program (FSS) (part 984 of this chapter).
(c)
Small rural PHA assessments.
Subpart D of this part covers the HCV and PBV assessment for a small rural PHA as defined in § 902.101 of this chapter. Section 985.3 and subparts B and C of this part do not apply to small rural PHAs.

§ 985.3
Indicators, HUD verification methods and ratings.
This section states the performance indicators that are used to assess PHA Section 8 management. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator in reviewing the accuracy of an PHA's annual SEMAP certification. HUD will prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA and will assign a rating for each indicator as shown. If the HUD verification method for the indicator relies on data in MTCS and HUD determines those data are insufficient to verify the PHA's certification on the indicator due to the PHA's failure to adequately report family data, HUD will assign a zero rating for the indicator. The method for selecting the PHA's quality control sample under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that the PHA's quality control sample was drawn in an unbiased manner.
A PHA that expends less than its Federal award expenditure threshold in 2 CFR Subpart F, and whose Section 8 programs are not audited by an independent auditor (IA), will not be rated under the SEMAP indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which the annual IA audit report is a HUD verification method.
(a)
Selection from the waiting list.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has written policies in its administrative plan for selecting applicants from the waiting list and whether the PHA follows these policies when selecting applicants for admission from the waiting list. (24 CFR 982.54(d)(1) and 982.204(a))
(2) HUD verification method: The independent auditor (IA) annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:
(A) The PHA has written waiting list selection policies in its administrative plan and,
(B) Based on the PHA's quality control samples, drawn separately for applicants reaching the top of the waiting list and for admissions, documentation shows that at least 98 percent of the families in both samples of applicants and admissions were selected from the waiting list for admission in accordance with these policies and met the selection criteria that determined their places on the waiting list and their order of selection. 15 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.
(b)
Reasonable rent.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has and implements a reasonable written method to determine and document for each unit leased that the rent to owner is reasonable based on current rents for comparable unassisted units: At the time of initial leasing; if there is any increase in the rent to owner; at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published fair market rent (FMR) in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. The PHA's method must take into consideration the location, size, type, quality and age of the units, and the amenities, housing services, and maintenance and utilities provided by the owners in determining comparability and the reasonable rent. (24 CFR 982.4, 24 CFR 982.54(d)(15), 982.158(f)(7), 982.507, and 983.303)
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:
(A) The PHA has a reasonable written method to determine reasonable rent which considers location, size, type, quality and age of the units and the amenities, housing services, and maintenance and utilities provided by the owners; and
(B) Based on the PHA's quality control sample of tenant files, the PHA
follows its written method to determine reasonable rent and has documented its determination that the rent to owner is reasonable in accordance with §§ 982.507 and 983.303 of this chapter, as applicable for at least 98 percent of units sampled at the time of initial leasing, if there is any increase in the rent to owner, and at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. 20 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification includes the statements in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, except that the PHA documents its determination of reasonable rent for only 80 to 97 percent of units sampled at initial leasing, if there is any increase in the rent to owner, and at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. 15 points.
(iii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statements in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. 0 points.
(c)
Determination of adjusted income.
(1) This indicator shows whether, at the time of admission and annual reexamination, the PHA verifies and correctly determines adjusted annual income for each assisted family and, where the family is responsible for utilities under the lease, the PHA uses the appropriate utility allowances for the unit leased in determining the gross rent. (24 CFR part 5, subpart F and 24 CFR 982.516)
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that, based on the PHA's quality control sample of tenant files, for at least 90 percent of families:
(A) The PHA obtains third party verification, as appropriate, of reported family annual income, the value of assets, expenses related to deductions from annual income, and other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income, and uses the verified information in determining adjusted income, and/or documents tenant files to show why third party verification was not available;
(B) The PHA properly attributes and calculates allowances for any medical, child care, and/or disability assistance expenses; and
(C) The PHA uses the appropriate utility allowances to determine gross rent for the unit leased. 20 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification includes the statements in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, except that the PHA obtains and uses independent verification of income, properly attributes allowances, and uses the appropriate utility allowances for only 80 to 89 percent of families. 15 points.
(iii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statements in either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section. 0 points.
(d)
Utility Allowance Schedule.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA maintains an up-to-date utility allowance schedule. (24 CFR 982.517)
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that the PHA reviewed utility rate data within the last 12 months, and adjusted its utility allowance schedule if there has been a change of 10 percent or more in a utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised. 5 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statement in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.
(e)
HQS quality control inspections.
(1) This indicator shows whether an PHA supervisor or other qualified person reinspects a sample of units under contract during the PHA fiscal year, which meets the minimum sample size requirements specified at § 985.2 under PHA's quality control sample, for quality control of HQS inspections. The PHA supervisor's reinspected sample is to be drawn from recently completed HQS inspections (i.e., performed during the 3 months preceding reinspection) and is to be drawn to represent a cross section of neighborhoods and the work
of a cross section of inspectors. (24 CFR 982.405(b))
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that an PHA supervisor or other qualified person performed quality control HQS reinspections during the PHA fiscal year for a sample of units under contract which meets the minimum sample size requirements specified in § 985.2 under PHA's quality control sample. The PHA's SEMAP certification also states that the reinspected sample was drawn from recently completed HQS inspections (i.e., performed during the 3 months preceding the quality control reinspection) and was drawn to represent a cross section of neighborhoods and the work of a cross section of inspectors. 5 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statements in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.
(f)
HQS enforcement.
(1) This indicator shows whether, following each HQS inspection of a unit under contract where the unit fails to meet HQS, any cited life-threatening HQS deficiencies are corrected within 24 hours from the inspection and all other cited HQS deficiencies are corrected within no more than 30 calendar days from the inspection or any PHA-approved extension. In addition, if HQS deficiencies are not corrected timely, the indicator shows whether the PHA stops (abates) housing assistance payments beginning no later than the first of the month following the specified correction period or terminates the HAP contract or, for family-caused defects, takes prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. (24 CFR 982.404)
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that the PHA's quality control sample of case files with failed HQS inspections shows that, for all cases sampled, any cited life-threatening HQS deficiencies were corrected within 24 hours from the inspection and, for at least 98 percent of cases sampled, all other cited HQS deficiencies were corrected within no more than 30 calendar days from the inspection or any PHA-approved extension, or, if any life-threatening HQS deficiencies were not corrected within 24 hours and all other HQS deficiencies were not corrected within 30 calendar days or any PHA-approved extension, the PHA stopped (abated) housing assistance payments beginning no later than the first of the month following the correction period, or took prompt and vigorous action to enforce family obligations. 10 points.

The indicator shows whether the PHA has adopted and implemented a written policy to encourage participation by owners of units located outside areas of poverty or minority concentration; informs rental voucher holders of the full range of areas where they may lease units both inside and outside the PHA's jurisdiction; and supplies a list of landlords or other parties who are willing to lease units or help families find units, including units outside areas of poverty or minority concentration. (24 CFR 982.54(d)(5), 982.301(a) and 982.301(b)(4) and 982.301(b)(12))
(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:
(A) The PHA has a written policy in its administrative plan which includes actions the PHA will take to encourage participation by owners of units located outside areas of poverty or minority concentration, and which clearly delineates areas in its jurisdiction that the PHA considers areas of poverty or minority concentration;
(B) PHA documentation shows that the PHA has taken actions indicated in
its written policy to encourage participation by owners of units located outside areas of poverty or minority concentration;
(C) The PHA has prepared maps that show various areas with housing opportunities outside areas of poverty or minority concentration both within its jurisdiction and neighboring its jurisdiction; has assembled information about the characteristics of those areas which may include information about job opportunities, schools, transportation and other services in these areas; and can demonstrate that it uses the maps and area characteristics information when briefing rental voucher holders about the full range of areas where they may look for housing;
(D) The PHA's information packet for rental voucher holders contains either a list of owners who are willing to lease (or properties available for lease) under the rental voucher program; or a current list of other organizations that will help families find units and the PHA can demonstrate that the list(s) includes properties or organizations that operate outside areas of poverty or minority concentration;

(F) PHA documentation shows that the PHA has analyzed whether rental voucher holders have experienced difficulties in finding housing outside areas of poverty or minority concentration and, if such difficulties have been found, PHA documentation shows that the PHA has analyzed whether it is appropriate to seek approval of exception payment standard amounts in any part of its jurisdiction and has sought HUD approval of exception payment standard amounts when necessary. 5 points.
(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statement in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.
(h)
Deconcentration bonus.
(1) Submission of deconcentration data in the HUD-prescribed format for this indicator is mandatory for a PHA using one or more payment standard amount(s) that exceed(s) 100 percent of the published FMR set at the 50th percentile rent to provide access to a broad range of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area in accordance with § 888.113(c) of this title, starting with the second full PHA fiscal year following initial use of payment standard amounts based on the FMR set at the 50th percentile rent. Submission of deconcentration data for this indicator is optional for all other PHAs. Additional SEMAP points are available to PHAs that have jurisdiction in metropolitan FMR areas and that choose to submit with their SEMAP certifications certain data, in a HUD-prescribed format, on the percent of their tenant-based Section 8 families with children who live in, and who have moved during the PHA fiscal year to, low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area. For purposes of this indicator, the PHA's principal operating area is the geographic entity for which the Census tabulates data that most closely matches the PHA's geographic jurisdiction under State or local law (e.g., city, county, metropolitan statistical area) as determined by the PHA, subject to HUD review. A low poverty census tract is defined as a census tract where the poverty rate of the tract is at or below 10 percent, or at or below the overall poverty rate for the principal operating area of the PHA, whichever is greater. The PHA determines the overall poverty rate for its principal operating area using the most recent available decennial Census data. Family data used for the PHA's analysis must be the same information as reported to MTCS for the PHA's tenant-based Section 8 families with children. If HUD determines that the quantity of MTCS data is insufficient for adequate analysis, HUD will not award points under this bonus indicator. Bonus points will be awarded if:
(i) Half or more of all Section 8 families with children assisted by the PHA in its principal operating area at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year reside in low poverty census tracts;
(ii) The percent of Section 8 mover families with children who moved to low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area during the last completed PHA fiscal year is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who reside in low poverty census tracts at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year; or
(iii) The percent of Section 8 families with children who moved to low-poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area over the last two completed PHA fiscal years is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who resided in low poverty census tracts at the end of the second to last completed PHA fiscal year.
(iv) State and regional PHAs that provide Section 8 rental assistance in more than one metropolitan area within a State or region make these determinations separately for each metropolitan area or portion of a metropolitan area where the PHA has assisted at least 20 Section 8 families with children in the last completed PHA fiscal year.
(2) HUD verification methods: PHA data submitted for the deconcentration bonus, the IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification, and on-site confirmatory review if performed.
(3) Rating: (i) The data submitted by the PHA for the deconcentration bonus shows that the PHA met the requirements for bonus points in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section. 5 points.
(ii) The data submitted by the PHA for the deconcentration bonus does not show that the PHA met the requirements for bonus points in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section. 0 points.

(ii) The PHA's voucher program payment standard schedule contains payment standards that were not set in accordance with § 982.503. 0 points.
(j)
Annual reexaminations.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA completes a reexamination for each participating family at least every 12 months. (24 CFR 5.617).
(2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows percent of reexaminations that are more than 2 months overdue. The 2-month allowance is provided only to accommodate a possible lag in the PHA's electronic reporting of the annual reexamination on Form HUD-50058 and to allow the processing of the data into MTCS. The 2-month allowance provided here for rating purposes does not mean that any delay in completing annual reexaminations is permitted.
(3) Rating:
(i) Fewer than 5 percent of all PHA reexaminations are more than 2 months overdue. 10 points.
(ii) 5 to 10 percent of all PHA reexaminations are more than 2 months overdue. 5 points.
(iii) More than 10 percent of all PHA reexaminations are more than 2 months overdue. 0 points.
(k)
Correct tenant rent calculations.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA correctly calculates the family's share of the rent to owner in the rental voucher program. (24 CFR part 982, subpart K).
(2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows percent of tenant rent and family's share of the rent to owner calculations that are incorrect based on data sent to HUD by the PHA on Forms HUD-50058. The MTCS data used for verification cover only voucher program tenancies, and do not include rent calculation discrepancies for manufactured home owner rentals of manufactured home spaces for proration of assistance under the noncitizen rule.
(3) Ratings:

(3) Rating:
(i) 98 to 100 percent of newly leased units passed HQS inspection within the time period required. 5 points.
(ii) Fewer than 98 percent of newly leased units passed HQS inspection within the time period required. 0 points.
(m)
Periodic HQS inspections.
(1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has met its periodic inspection requirement for its units under contract (24 CFR 982.405 and 983.103(e)).
(2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows percent of HQS inspections that are more than 2 months overdue. The 2-month allowance is provided only to accommodate a possible lag in the PHA's electronic reporting of the annual HQS inspection on Form HUD-50058, and to allow the processing of the data into MTCS. The 2-month allowance provided here for rating purposes does not mean that any delay in completing annual HQS inspections is permitted.
(3) Rating:
(i) Fewer than 5 percent of periodic HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 10 points.
(ii) 5 to 10 percent of all periodic HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 5 points.

(n)
Lease-up.
The provisions of this paragraph (n) apply to the first SEMAP certification due after July 2, 2012.
(1)
The indicator:
This indicator shows whether the PHA enters into HAP contracts for the number of the PHA's baseline voucher units (units that are contracted under a Consolidated ACC) for the calendar year that ends on or before the PHA's fiscal year or whether the PHA has expended its allocated budget authority for the same calendar year. Allocated budget authority will be based upon the PHA's eligibility, which includes budget authority obligated for the calendar year and any portion of HAP reserves attributable to the budget authority that was offset from reserves during the calendar year. Litigation units and funding will be excluded from this indicator, and new increments will be excluded for 12 months from the effective date of the increment on the Consolidated ACC. Units assisted under the voucher homeownership option and units occupied under a project-based HAP contract are included in the measurement of this indicator.
(2)
HUD verification method:
This method is based on the percent of units leased under a tenant-based or project-based HAP contract or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year. The percent of units leased is determined by taking unit months leased under a HAP contract and unit months occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, as shown in HUD systems for the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year, and dividing that number by the number of unit months available for leasing based on the number of baseline units available at the beginning of the calendar year.
(3)
Rating:
(i) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar
year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was 98 percent or more. (20 points.)
(ii) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was 95 to 97 percent. (15 points.)
(iii) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was less than 95 percent. (0 points.)
(o)
Family self-sufficiency (FSS) enrollment and escrow accounts.
(1) This indicator applies only to PHAs with mandatory FSS programs. The indicator consists of 2 components which show whether the PHA has enrolled families in the FSS program as required, and the extent of the PHA's progress in supporting FSS by measuring the percent of current FSS participants with FSS progress reports entered in MTCS that have had increases in earned income which resulted in escrow account balances. (24 CFR 984.105 and 984.305)
(2) HUD verification method: MTCS report—Shows number of families currently enrolled in FSS. This number is divided by the number of mandatory FSS slots, as determined under § 984.105 of this chapter. An MTCS report also shows the percent of FSS families with FSS progress reports who have escrow account balances. HUD also uses information reported on the SEMAP certification by initial PHAs concerning FSS families enrolled in their FSS programs but who have moved under portability to the jurisdiction of another PHA.
(3) Rating:
(i) The PHA has filled 80 percent or more of its mandatory FSS slots and 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances. 10 points.
(ii) The PHA has filled 60 to 79 percent of its mandatory FSS slots and 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances. 8 points.
(iii) The PHA has filled 80 percent or more of its mandatory FSS slots, but fewer than 30 percent of FSS families have escrow account balances. 5 points.
(iv) 30 percent or more of FSS families have escrow account balances, but fewer than 60 percent of the PHA's mandatory FSS slots are filled. 5 points.
(v) The PHA has filled 60 to 79 percent of its mandatory FSS slots, but fewer than 30 percent of FSS families have escrow account balances. 3 points.
(vi) The PHA has filled fewer than 60 percent of its mandatory FSS slots and less than 30 percent of FSS families have escrow account balances. 0 points.
(p)
Success rate of voucher holders.
(1) This indicator shows whether voucher holders were successful in leasing units with voucher assistance. This indicator applies only to PHAs that established success rate payment standard amounts in accordance with § 982.503(f) prior to June 6, 2024.
(2) HUD verification method: MTCS Report.
(3)
Rating (5 points):
(i) The proportion of families issued rental vouchers during the last PHA fiscal year that have become participants in the voucher program is more than the higher of:
(A) 75 percent; or
(B) The proportion of families issued rental vouchers that became participants in the program during the six month period utilized to determine eligibility for success rate payment standards under § 982.503(f) plus 5 percentage points; and

# Subpart B—Program Operation
§ 985.101
SEMAP certification.
(a) An PHA must submit the HUD-required SEMAP certification form within 60 calendar days after the end of its fiscal year.
(1) The certification must be approved by PHA board resolution and signed by the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or a state, a resolution approving the certification is not required, and
the certification must be executed by the Section 8 program director.
(2) An PHA that subcontracts administration of its program to one or more subcontractors shall require each subcontractor to submit the subcontractor's own SEMAP certification on the HUD-prescribed form to the PHA in support of the PHA's SEMAP certification to HUD. The PHA shall retain subcontractor certifications for 3 years.
(3) An PHA may include with its SEMAP certification any information bearing on the accuracy or completeness of the information used by the PHA in providing its certification.
(b) Failure of an PHA to submit its SEMAP certification within 60 calendar days after the end of its fiscal year will result in an overall performance rating of troubled and the PHA will be subject to the requirements at § 985.107.
(c) An PHA's SEMAP certification is subject to HUD verification by an on-site confirmatory review at any time.
(Information collection requirements in this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0215)
[63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 50006, Oct. 1, 2001]
§ 985.102
SEMAP profile.
Upon receipt of the PHA's SEMAP certification, HUD will rate the PHA's performance under each SEMAP indicator in accordance with § 985.3. HUD will then prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA which shows the rating for each indicator, sums the indicator ratings, and divides by the total possible points to arrive at an PHA's overall SEMAP score. SEMAP scores shall be rounded off to the nearest whole percent.
§ 985.103
SEMAP score and overall performance rating.
(a)
High performer rating.
PHAs with SEMAP scores of at least 90 percent shall be rated high performers under SEMAP. PHAs that achieve an overall performance rating of high performer may receive national recognition by the Department and may be given competitive advantage under notices of fund availability.
(b)
Standard rating.
PHAs with SEMAP scores of 60 to 89 percent shall be rated standard.
(c)
Troubled rating.
PHAs with SEMAP scores of less than 60 percent shall be rated troubled.
(d)
Modified rating on an indicator.
A rating on any of the indicators at §§ 985.3(a) through 985.3(h) will be subject to change after HUD receives the PHA's annual audit report or after HUD conducts a confirmatory review if the audit report or the confirmatory review report contains information that the PHA's SEMAP certification concerning an indicator is not accurate.
(e)
Modified or withheld overall rating.
(1) Notwithstanding an PHA's SEMAP score, HUD may modify or withhold an PHA's overall performance rating when warranted by circumstances which have bearing on the SEMAP indicators such as an PHA's appeal of its overall rating, adverse litigation, a conciliation agreement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring and compliance review findings, fraud or misconduct, audit findings or substantial noncompliance with program requirements.
(2) Notwithstanding an PHA's SEMAP score, if the latest IA report submitted for the PHA under the Single Audit Act indicates that the auditor is unable to provide an opinion as to whether the PHA's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals, or an opinion that the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, the PHA will automatically be given an overall performance rating of troubled and the PHA will be subject to the requirements at § 985.107.
(3) When HUD modifies or withholds a rating for any reason, it shall explain in writing to the PHA the reasons for the modification or for withholding the rating.
[63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 40498, July 26, 1999]
§ 985.104
PHA right of appeal of overall rating.
An PHA may appeal its overall performance rating to HUD by providing justification of the reasons for its appeal. An appeal made to a HUD hub or program center or to the HUD Troubled Agency Recovery Center and denied may be further appealed to the Assistant Secretary.
§ 985.105
HUD SEMAP responsibilities.
(a)
Frequency of SEMAP assessments
—(1)
Annual review.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD shall assess each PHA's performance under SEMAP annually and shall assign each PHA a SEMAP score and overall performance rating.
(2)
Biennial review for small PHAs.
HUD shall assess and score the performance of a PHA with less than 250 assisted units once every other PHA fiscal year, unless the PHA:
(i) Elects to have its performance assessed on an annual basis; or
(ii) Is designated as troubled, in accordance with § 985.103.
(b)
Notification to PHA.
No later than 120 calendar days after the PHA's fiscal year end, HUD shall notify each PHA in writing of its rating on each SEMAP indicator, of its overall SEMAP score and of its overall performance rating (high performer, standard, troubled). The HUD notification letter shall identify and require correction of any SEMAP deficiencies (indicator rating of zero) within 45 calendar days from date of HUD notice.
(c)
On-site confirmatory review.
HUD may conduct an on-site confirmatory review to verify the PHA certification and the HUD rating under any indicator.

(Information collection requirements in this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0215)
§ 985.107
Required actions for PHA with troubled performance rating.
(a)
On-site reviews
—(1)
Required reviews for troubled PHAs.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD will conduct an on-site review of PHA program management for any PHA assigned an overall performance rating of troubled to assess the magnitude and seriousness of the PHA's noncompliance with performance requirements.
(2)
On-site reviews for small PHAs.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, HUD may elect not to conduct an on-site review of a troubled PHA, if:
(i) The PHA has less than 250 assisted units; and
(ii) HUD determines that an on-site review is unnecessary to determine the needs of the PHA and the actions required to address the program deficiencies.
(b)
HUD written report.
HUD must provide the PHA a written report of its on-site review containing HUD findings of program management deficiencies,
the apparent reasons for the deficiencies, and recommendations for improvement.
(c)
PHA corrective action plan.
Upon receipt of the HUD written report on its on-site review, the PHA must write a corrective action plan and submit it to HUD for approval. The corrective action plan must:
(1) Specify goals to be achieved;
(2) Identify obstacles to goal achievement and ways to eliminate or avoid them;
(3) Identify resources that will be used or sought to achieve goals;
(4) Identify an PHA staff person with lead responsibility for completing each goal;
(5) Identify key tasks to reach each goal;
(6) Specify time frames for achievement of each goal, including intermediate time frames to complete each key task; and
(7) Provide for regular evaluation of progress toward improvement.
(8) Be signed by the PHA board of commissioners chairperson and by the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or a state, the corrective action plan must be signed by the Section 8 program director and by the chief executive officer of the unit of government or his or her designee.
(d)
Monitoring.
The PHA and HUD must monitor the PHA's implementation of its corrective action plan to ensure performance targets are met.
(e)
Use of administrative fee reserve prohibited.
Any PHA assigned an overall performance rating of troubled may not use any part of the administrative fee reserve for other housing purposes (see 24 CFR 982.155(b)).
(f)
Upgrading poor performance rating.
HUD shall change an PHA's overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer if HUD determines that a change in the rating is warranted because of improved PHA performance and an improved SEMAP score.
(Information collection requirements in this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0215)
[63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 37672, June 24, 2003]
§ 985.108

§ 985.109
Default under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
HUD may determine that an PHA's failure to correct identified SEMAP deficiencies or to prepare and implement a corrective action plan required by HUD constitutes a default under the ACC.
Subpart C—Physical Assessment Component [Reserved]

# Subpart D—Small Rural PHA Assessment

# Source:
88 FR 30505, May 11, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
§ 985.201
Applicability.
(a) This subpart applies to small rural PHAs as defined in § 902.101 of this chapter.
(b) Small rural PHAs shall be assessed and rated on the indicators and methodology of this subpart and shall not be subject to the SEMAP requirements.
§ 985.203
Assessment indicators and HUD verification methods.
(a) This section describes the performance indicators used to assess a PHA's designation as troubled resulting from the small rural PHA assessment. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator. The four indicators are determined on a pass or fail basis.
(b)(1)
Inspection standards.
This indicator shows whether the PHA applied the correct inspection standards to HCV and PBV unit inspections.
(2)
HUD verification method.
The PHA's assessment certification and on-site HUD review when applicable.
(3)
Rating.
The PHA passes the indicator if it applied the correct inspection standards for all unit HCV and PBV unit inspections conducted during the assessment period. If the PHA applied the incorrect inspection standards for any HCV or PBV unit inspection during the assessment period, the PHA fails the indicator.
(c)(1)
Initial unit inspections.
This indicator determines if the PHA conducted the initial HQS inspections within the required time period.
(2)
HUD verification method.
HUD systems show percent of newly leased units where the beginning date of the assistance contract is before the date the unit passed the initial unit inspection or, if the PHA employed the PHA initial inspection option for non-life-threatening deficiencies or alternative inspections, the timing requirements for the applicable PHA initial inspection option.
(3)
Rating.
The PHA passes the indicator if at least 98 percent of units placed under HAP contract during the assessment period passed the initial PHA HQS inspection within the required time period. If fewer than 98 percent of units placed under HAP contract during the assessment period passed the HQS inspection within the required time periods, the PHA fails the indicator.
(d)(1)
Frequency of HQS inspections.
This indicator shows, for units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years, whether the PHA re-inspected tenant-based units under HAP contract and the required sample of PBV units at least once during the three-year period from the last PHA inspection.
(2)
HUD verification method.
HUD systems show the percentage of units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years that have been re-inspected within the required three-year period from the last inspection.
(3)
Rating.
The PHA passes the indicator if at least 98 percent of the units that have been under HAP contract for at least three years have been re-inspected within the required three-year period from the last inspection. The PHA fails the indicator if fewer than 98 percent of these units have been re-inspected within the required three-year period.
(e)(1)
Unit condition enforcement.
This indicator shows whether, following the inspection of a unit under contract where the unit fails to meet the required standards, any cited life-threatening and non-life-threatening deficiencies are corrected within the required cure period in accordance with §§ 982.404 and 983.103 of this chapter. In addition, if HQS deficiencies are not corrected timely, the indicator shows whether the PHA stops (abates) housing assistance payments beginning no later than the first of the month following the specified correction period or terminates the HAP contract or, for family-caused defects, takes prompt and vigorous action to enforce the family obligations. (§ 982.404 of this chapter)
(2)
HUD verification method.
The PHA certification and on-site HUD review (if performed), and HUD system data.
(3)
Rating.
In order to pass the indicator, the applicable verification method, which may include sampling, determines that the PHA took corrective action within the required timeframes for at least 98 percent of inspections with identified life-threatening or other HQS deficiencies.
(f)(1)
PHA submission of certifications.
The PHA must submit its certifications for the applicable indicators within the designated timeframe required by HUD, and in the form and manner as required by HUD. HUD will issue instructions on the submission of PHA certifications by
Federal Register
notification, which will be subject to public comment.
(2)
Failure to submit.
Failure of the PHA to submit any certification in accordance with this paragraph will result in the PHA failing the indicator and being designated as troubled under the small rural PHA assessment.
§ 985.205
Determination of assessment rating.
(a)
High performer designation.
(1) A PHA is designated a high performer under the small rural PHA assessment if the PHA has passed all four indicators identified in § 985.203 and the PHA:
(i) Has utilized at least 98 percent of its HCV budget authority in the two
most recent calendar years, or the percent of HCV units leased by renters or occupied by homeowners in the two most recent calendar years was at least 98 percent;
(ii) Did not end that calendar year with excess HAP reserves; and
(iii) Did not end that calendar year in a funding shortfall or receive shortfall prevention funding from HUD.
(2) HUD shall publish the calculation for determining excess HAP reserves in the
Federal Register,
and such calculation shall provide for public comment before becoming effective.
(b)
Standard performer designation.
A PHA that passed all four indicators but did not meet the funding utilization criteria for a high performer designation in paragraph (a) is designated as a standard performer.
(c)
Troubled PHA designation.
A PHA that failed any of the four indicators under § 985.201 is designated as a troubled PHA under the small rural PHA assessment.
§ 985.207
Frequency of assessments.
(a)
Frequency of small rural PHA assessments
—(1)
Initial assessment.
The initial small rural PHA assessment will be effective when the PHA's next SEMAP assessment would have been applied. For PHAs that qualify for SEMAP biennial review as a small PHA (less than 250 assisted units), the transition to the small rural PHA assessment will occur when the PHA's next biennial SEMAP assessment is required.
(2)
Triennial assessments.
HUD shall assess small rural PHAs no more than once every three years, except that a troubled small rural PHA shall be subject to an annual assessment in accordance with § 985.209.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 985.209
Troubled small rural PHAs.
(a)
Appeals
—(1)
HUD action.
HUD must review, consider, and provide a final written determination to a small rural PHA that appeals its designation as a troubled PHA.
(2)
Deciding HUD official.
The HUD decision on the PHA appeal shall be made by a HUD official who has not been involved in and is not subordinate to any person who has been involved in the original determination to designate the PHA as a troubled PHA under the small rural PHA assessment.
(b)
Corrective action agreement.
No later than 60 days after the date on which the PHA is designated a troubled PHA, the PHA and HUD will enter into a corrective action agreement (CAA) under which the PHA shall take actions to correct the deficiencies upon which the troubled PHA designation is based. The PHA must comply with HUD requirements for the submission of the CAA, including but not limited to the date by which the CAA must be submitted to HUD. The CAA must:
(1) Have a term of one year, and shall be renewable at the option of HUD;
(2) Specify goals to be achieved;
(3) Identify obstacles to goal achievement and ways to eliminate or avoid them;
(4) Identify resources that will be used or sought to achieve goals;
(5) Provide, where feasible, for technical assistance to assist the PHA in curing its deficiencies;
(6) Identify a PHA staff person with lead responsibility for completing each goal;
(7) Identify key tasks to reach each goal;
(8) Specify time frames for achievement of each goal, including intermediate time frames to complete each key task;
(9) Provide for regular evaluation of progress toward improvement;
(10) Provide for the reconsideration of the PHA's designation as a troubled PHA no less than annually, and provide for the termination of the CAA when HUD determines the PHA is no longer troubled;
(11) Provide that in the event of substantial noncompliance by the PHA under the CAA, HUD may (i) contract with another PHA or a private entity to administer the HCV program; and (ii) withhold funds otherwise distributable to the troubled PHA;
(12) Be signed by the PHA board of commissioners chairperson and by the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or a State, the CAA must be signed by the Section 8 program director and by the chief executive officer of the unit of government or his or her designee.
(c)
Monitoring.
The PHA and HUD must monitor the PHA's implementation of its CAA to ensure performance targets are met.
(d)
Annual small rural assessment.
A troubled PHA shall be subject to the small rural assessment on an annual basis.
(e)
Use of administrative fee reserve prohibited.
Any PHA designated as troubled may not use any part of the administrative fee reserve for other housing purposes (
see
§ 982.155(b) of this chapter).
(f)
Upgrading poor performance rating.
HUD shall change a PHA's overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer if HUD determines that a change in the rating is warranted because of improved PHA performance and a standard or high designation on a subsequent small rural PHA assessment.
(g)
Default under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
HUD may determine that a PHA's failure to correct identified deficiencies resulting from its small rural PHA assessment or to execute and implement a CAA as required by HUD constitutes a default under the ACC.
§ 985.211
Small rural PHA assessment records.
HUD shall maintain small rural PHA assessment files, including designations, notifications, appeals, corrective action agreements, and related correspondence for at least 3 years.

# Subpart A—Purpose, Applicability, Formula, and Definitions
§ 990.100
Purpose.
This part implements section 9(f) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), (42 U.S.C. 1437g). Section 9(f) establishes an Operating Fund for the purposes of making assistance available to public housing agencies (PHAs) for the operation and management of public housing. In the case of unsubsidized housing, the total expenses of operating rental housing should be covered by the operating income, which primarily consists of rental income and, to some degree, investment and non-rental income. In the case of public housing, the Operating Fund provides operating subsidy to assist PHAs to serve low, very low, and extremely low-income families. This part describes the policies and procedures for Operating Fund formula calculations and management under the Operating Fund Program.
§ 990.105
Applicability.
(a)
Applicability of this part.
(1) With the exception of subpart I of this part, this part is applicable to all PHA rental units under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). This includes PHAs that have not received operating subsidy previously, but are eligible for operating subsidy under the Operating Fund Formula.
(2) This part is applicable to all rental units managed by a resident management corporation (RMC), including a direct-funded RMC.
(b)
Inapplicability of this part.
(1) This part is not applicable to Indian Housing, section 5(h) and section 32 homeownership projects, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the section 23 Leased Housing Program, or the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs.
(2) With the exception of subpart J of this part, this part is not applicable to the Mutual Help Program or the Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Program.
§ 990.110
Operating fund formula.
(a)
General formula.
(1) The amount of annual contributions (operating subsidy) each PHA is eligible to receive under this part shall be determined by a formula.
(2) In general, operating subsidy shall be the difference between formula expense and formula income. If a PHA's formula expense is greater than its formula income, then the PHA is eligible for an operating subsidy.
(3) Formula expense is an estimate of a PHA's operating expense and is determined by the following three components: Project Expense Level (PEL), Utility Expense Level (UEL), and other formula expenses (add-ons). Formula expense and its three components are further described in subpart C of this part. Formula income is an estimate for a PHA's non-operating subsidy revenue and is further described in subpart D of this part.
(4) Certain portions of the operating fund formula (
e.g.
, PEL) are calculated in terms of per unit per month (PUM) amounts and are converted into whole dollars by multiplying the PUM amount by the number of eligible unit months (EUMs). EUMs are further described in subpart B of this part.
(b)
Specific formula.
(1) A PHA's formula amount shall be the sum of the three formula expense components calculated as follows: {[(PEL multiplied by EUM) plus (UEL multiplied by EUM) plus add-ons] minus (formula income multiplied by EUM)}.
(2) A PHA whose formula amount is equal to or less than zero is still eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit cost for its Operating Fund Program.
(3) Operating subsidy payments will be limited to the availability of funds as described in § 990.210(c).
(c)
Non-codified formula elements.
This part defines the major components of the Operating Fund Formula and describes the relationships of these various components. However, this part does not codify certain secondary elements that will be used in the revised Operating Fund Formula. HUD will more appropriately provide this information in non-codified guidance, such as a Handbook,
Federal Register
notice, or other non-regulatory means that HUD determines appropriate.

# Subpart B—Eligibility for Operating Subsidy; Computation of Eligible Unit Months
§ 990.120
Unit months.
(a) Some of the components of HUD's Operating Fund Formula are based on a measure known as unit months. Unit months represent a PHA's public housing inventory during a specified period of time. The unit months eligible for operating subsidy in a 12-month period are equal to the number of months that the units are in an operating subsidy-eligible category, adjusted for changes in inventory (
e.g.
, units added or removed), as described below.
(b) A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for a unit on the date it is both placed under the ACC and occupied. The date a unit is eligible for operating subsidy does not change the Date of Full Availability (DOFA) or the date of the End of Initial Operating Period (EIOP), nor does this provision place a project into management status.
§ 990.125
Eligible units.
A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for public housing units under an ACC for:
(a) Occupied dwelling units as defined in § 990.140;
(b) A dwelling unit with an approved vacancy (as defined in § 990.145); and
(c) A limited number of vacancies (as defined in § 990.150).
§ 990.130
Ineligible units.
(a) Vacant units that do not fall within the definition of § 990.145 or § 990.150 are not eligible for operating subsidy under this part.
(b) Units that are eligible to receive an asset-repositioning fee, as described in § 990.190(h), are not eligible to receive operating subsidy under this subpart.
§ 990.135
Eligible unit months (EUMs).
(a) A PHA's total number of EUMs will be calculated for the 12-month period from July 1st to June 30th that is prior to the first day of the applicable funding period, and will consist of eligible units as defined in § 990.140, § 990.145, or § 990.150.
(b)(1) The determination of whether a public housing unit satisfies the requirements of § 990.140, § 990.145, or § 990.150 for any unit month shall be based on the unit's status as of either the first or last day of the month, as determined by the PHA.
(2) HUD reserves the right to determine the status of any and all public housing units based on information in its information systems.
(c) The PHA shall maintain and, at HUD's request, shall make available to HUD, specific documentation of the status of all units, including, but not limited to, a listing of the units, street
addresses or physical address, and project/management control numbers.
(d) Any unit months that do not meet the requirements of this subpart are not eligible for operating subsidy, and will not be subsidized by the Operating Fund.
§ 990.140
Occupied dwelling units.
A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for public housing units for each unit month that those units are under an ACC and occupied by a public housing-eligible family under lease.
§ 990.145
Dwelling units with approved vacancies.
(a) A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy for vacant public housing units for each unit month the units are under an ACC and meet one of the following HUD-approved vacancies:
(1)
Units undergoing modernization.
Vacancies resulting from project modernization or unit modernization (such as work necessary to reoccupy vacant units) provided that one of the following conditions is met:
(i) The unit is undergoing modernization (
i.e.
, the modernization contract has been awarded or force account work has started) and must be vacant to perform the work, and the construction is on schedule according to a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan; or
(ii) The unit must be vacant to perform the work and the treatment of the vacant unit is included in a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan, but the time period for placing the vacant unit under construction has not yet expired. The PHA shall place the vacant unit under construction within two federal fiscal years (FFYs) after the FFY in which the capital funds are approved.
(2)
Special use units.
Units approved and used for resident services, resident organization offices, and related activities, such as self-sufficiency and anti-crime initiatives.
(b) On a project-by-project basis, subject to prior HUD approval and for the time period agreed to by HUD, a PHA shall receive operating subsidy for the units affected by the following events that are outside the control of the PHA:
(1)
Litigation.
Units that are vacant due to litigation, such as a court order or settlement agreement that is legally enforceable; units that are vacant in order to meet regulatory and statutory requirements to avoid potential litigation (as covered in a HUD-approved PHA Annual Plan); and units under voluntary compliance agreements with HUD or other voluntary compliance agreements acceptable to HUD (
e.g.
, units that are being held vacant as part of a court-order, HUD-approved desegregation plan, or voluntary compliance agreement requiring modifications to the units to make them accessible pursuant to 24 CFR part 8).
(2)
Disasters.
Units that are vacant due to a federally declared, state-declared, or other declared disaster.
(3)
Casualty losses.
Damaged units that remain vacant due to delays in settling insurance claims.

Limited vacancies.
(a)
Operating subsidy for a limited number of vacancies.
HUD will pay operating subsidy for a limited number of vacant units under an ACC. The limited number of vacant units must be equal to or less than 3 percent of the unit months on a project-by-project basis based on the definition of a project under § 990.265 (provided that the number of eligible unit months does not exceed 100 percent of the unit months for a project).
(b)
Exception for PHAs with 100 or fewer units.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA with 100 or fewer units will be paid operating subsidy for up to five vacant units not to exceed 100 percent of the unit months under an ACC. For example, a PHA with an inventory of 100 units and four vacancies during its fiscal year will be eligible for operating subsidy for all 100 units. A PHA with an inventory of 50 units with seven vacancies during its fiscal year will be eligible for operating subsidy for 48 units.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 81 FR 12377, Mar. 8, 2016]
§ 990.155
Addition and deletion of units.
(a)
Changes in public housing unit inventory.
To generate a change to its formula amount within each one-year funding period, PHAs shall periodically (
e.g.
, quarterly) report the following information to HUD, during the funding period:
(1) New units that were added to the ACC, and occupied by a public housing-eligible family during the prior reporting period for the one-year funding period, but have not been included in the previous EUMs' data; and
(2) Projects, or entire buildings in a project, that are eligible to receive an asset repositioning fee in accordance with the provisions in § 990.190(h).
(b)
Revised EUM calculation.
(1) For new units, the revised calculation shall assume that all such units will be fully occupied for the balance of that funding period. The actual occupancy/vacancy status of these units will be included to calculate the PHA's operating subsidy in the subsequent funding period after these units have one full year of a reporting cycle.
(2) Projects, or entire buildings in a project, that are eligible to receive an asset repositioning fee in accordance with § 990.190(h) are not to be included in the calculation of EUMs. Funding for these units is provided under the conditions described in § 990.190(h).

# Subpart C—Calculating Formula Expenses
§ 990.160
Overview of calculating formula expenses.
(a)
General.
Formula expenses represent the costs of services and materials needed by a well-run PHA to sustain the project. These costs include items such as administration, maintenance, and utilities. HUD also determines a PHA's formula expenses at a project level. HUD uses the following three factors to determine the overall formula expense level for each project:
(1)The project expense level (PEL) (calculated in accordance with § 990.165);
(2) The utilities expense level (UEL) (calculated in accordance with §§ 990.170, 990.175, 990.180, and 990.185); and
(3)Other formula expenses (add-ons) (calculated in accordance with § 990.190).
(b)
PEL, UEL, and Add-ons.
Each project of a PHA has a unique PEL and UEL. The PEL for each project is based on ten characteristics and certain adjustments described in § 990.165. The PEL represents the normal expenses of operating public housing projects, such as maintenance and administration costs. The UEL for each project represents utility expenses. Utility expense levels are based on an incentive system aimed at reducing utility expenses. Both the PEL and UEL are expressed in PUM costs. The expenses not included in these expense levels and which are unique to PHAs are titled “other formula expenses (add-ons)” and are expressed in a dollar amount.
(c)
Calculating project formula expense.
The formula expense of any one project is the sum of the project's PEL and the UEL, multiplied by the total EUMs specific to the project, plus the add-ons.
§ 990.165
Computation of project expense level (PEL).
(a)
Computation of PEL.
The PEL is calculated in terms of PUM cost and represents the costs associated with the project, except for utility and add-on costs. Costs associated with the PEL are administration, management fees, maintenance, protective services, leasing, occupancy, staffing, and other expenses, such as project insurance. HUD will calculate the PEL using regression analysis and benchmarking for the actual costs of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) projects to estimate costs for public housing projects. HUD will use the ten variables described in paragraph (b) of this section and their associated coefficient (
i.e.
, values that are expressed in percentage terms) to produce a PEL.
(b)
Variables.
The ten variables are:
(1) Size of project (number of units);
(2) Age of property (Date of Full Availability (DOFA));
(3) Bedroom mix;
(4) Building type;
(5) Occupancy type (family or senior);
(6) Location (an indicator of the type of community in which a property is located; location types include rural,
city central metropolitan, and non-city central metropolitan (suburban) areas);
(7) Neighborhood poverty rate;
(8) Percent of households assisted;
(9) Ownership type (profit, non-profit, or limited dividend); and
(10) Geographic.
(c)
Cost adjustments.
HUD will apply four adjustments to the PEL. The adjustments are:
(1) Application of a $200 PUM floor for any senior property and a $215 PUM floor for any family property;
(2) Application of a $420 PUM ceiling for any property except for New York City Housing Authority projects, which have a $480 PUM ceiling;
(3) Application of a four percent reduction for any PEL calculated over $325 PUM, with the reduction limited so that a PEL will not be reduced to less than $325; and
(4) The reduction of audit costs as reported for FFY 2003 in a PUM amount.
(d)
Annual inflation factor.
The PEL for each project shall be adjusted annually, beginning in 2005, by the local inflation factor. The local inflation factor shall be the HUD-determined weighted average percentage increase in local government wages and salaries for the area in which the PHA is located, and non-wage expenses.
(e)
Calculating a PEL.
To calculate a specific PEL for a given property, the sum of the coefficients for nine variables (all variables except ownership type) shall be added to a formula constant. The exponent of that sum shall be multiplied by a percentage to reflect the non-profit ownership type, which will produce an unadjusted PEL. For the calculation of the initial PEL, the cost adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section will be applied. After these initial adjustments are applied, the audit adjustment described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section will be applied to arrive at the PEL in year 2000 dollars. After the PEL in year 2000 dollars is created, the annual inflation factor as described in paragraph (d) of this section will be applied cumulatively to this number through 2004 to yield an initial PEL in terms of current dollars.
(f)
Calculation of the PEL for Moving to Work PHAs.
PHAs participating in the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration authorized under section 204 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) shall receive an operating subsidy as provided in Attachment A of their MTW Agreements executed prior to November 18, 2005. PHAs with an MTW Agreement will continue to have the right to request extensions of or modifications to their MTW Agreements.
(g)
Calculation of the PELs for mixed-finance developments.
If, prior to November 18, 2005, a PHA has either a mixed-finance arrangement that has closed or has filed documents in accordance with 24 CFR 941.606 for a mixed-finance transaction, then the project covered by the mixed-finance transaction will receive funding based on the higher of its former Allowable Expense Level or the new computed PEL.
(h)
Calculation of PELs when data are inadequate or unavailable.
When sufficient data are unavailable for the calculation of a PEL, HUD may calculate a PEL using an alternative methodology. The characteristics may be used from similarly situated properties.
(i)
Review of PEL methodology by advisory committee.
In 2009, HUD will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders, to review the methodology to evaluate the PEL based on actual cost data. The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). HUD may determine appropriate funding levels for each project to be effective in FY 2011 after following appropriate rulemaking procedures.
§ 990.170
Computation of utilities expense level (UEL): Overview.
(a)
General.
The UEL for each PHA is based on its consumption for each utility, the applicable rates for each utility, and an applicable inflation factor. The UEL for a given funding period is the product of the utility rate multiplied by the payable consumption level multiplied by the inflation factor. The UEL is expressed in terms of PUM costs.
(b)
Utility rate.
The utility rate for each type of utility will be the actual average rate from the most recent 12-
month period that ended June 30th prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period. The rate will be calculated by dividing the actual utility cost by the actual utility consumption, with consideration for pass-through costs (
e.g.
, state and local utility taxes, tariffs) for the time period specified in this paragraph.
(c)
Payable consumption level.
The payable consumption level is based on the current consumption level adjusted by a utility consumption incentive. The incentive shall be computed by comparing current consumption levels of each utility to the rolling base consumption level. If the comparison reflects a decrease in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall retain 75 percent of this decrease. Alternately, if the comparison reflects an increase in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall absorb 75 percent of this increase.
(d)
Inflation factor for utilities.
The UEL shall be adjusted annually by an inflation/deflation factor based upon the fuels and utilities component of the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The annual adjustment to the UEL shall reflect the most recently published and localized data available from BLS at the time the annual adjustment is calculated.
(e)
Increases in tenant utility allowances.
Increases in tenant utility allowances, as a component of the formula income, as described in § 990.195, shall result in a commensurate increase of operating subsidy. Decreases in such utility allowances shall result in a commensurate decrease in operating subsidy.
(f)
Records and reporting.
(1) Appropriate utility records, satisfactory to HUD, shall be developed and maintained, so that consumption and rate data can be determined.
(2) All records shall be kept by utility and by project for each 12-month period ending June 30th.
(3) HUD will notify each PHA when HUD has the automated systems capacity to receive such information. Each PHA then will be obligated to provide consumption and cost data to HUD for all utilities for each project.
(4) If a PHA has not maintained or cannot recapture utility data from its records for a particular utility, the PHA shall compute the UEL by:
(i) Using actual consumption data for the last complete year(s) of available data or data of comparable project(s) that have comparable utility delivery systems and occupancy, in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD; or
(ii) Requesting field office approval to use actual PUM utility expenses for its UEL in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD when the PHA cannot obtain necessary data to calculate the UEL in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.
§ 990.175
Utilities expense level: Computation of the current consumption level.
The current consumption level shall be the actual amount of each utility consumed during the 12-month period ending June 30th that is 6 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.
§ 990.180
Utilities expense level: Computation of the rolling base consumption level.
(a)
General.
(1) The rolling base consumption level (RBCL) shall be equal to the average of yearly consumption levels for the 36-month period ending on the June 30th that is 18 months prior to the first day of the applicable funding period.
(2) The yearly consumption level is the actual amount of each utility consumed during a 12-month period ending June 30th. For example, for the funding period January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2006, the RBCL will be the average of the following yearly consumption levels:
(i) Year 1 = July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002.
(ii) Year 2 = July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003.
(iii) Year 3 = July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(2):
In this example, the current year's consumption level will be July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005.
(b)
Distortions to rolling base consumption level.
The PHA shall have its RBCL determined so as not to distort the
rolling base period in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD if:
(1) A project has not been in operation during at least 12 months of the rolling base period;
(2) A project enters or exits management after the rolling base period and prior to the end of the applicable funding period; or
(3) A project has experienced a conversion from one energy source to another, switched from PHA-supplied to resident-purchased utilities during or after the rolling base period, or for any other reason that would cause the RBCL not to be comparable to the current year's consumption level.
(c)
Financial incentives.
The three-year rolling base for all relevant utilities will be adjusted to reflect any financial incentives to the PHA to reduce consumption as described in § 990.185.
§ 990.185
Utilities expense level: Incentives for energy conservation/rate reduction.
(a)
General/consumption reduction.
If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD, the PHA may qualify for the incentives available under this section. For a PHA to qualify for these incentives, the PHA must enter into a contract to finance the energy conservation measures, and must obtain HUD approval. Such approval shall be based on a determination that payments under a contract can be funded from reasonably anticipated energy cost savings. The contract period shall not exceed 20 years. The energy conservation measures may include, but are not limited to: Physical improvements financed by a loan from a bank, utility, or governmental entity; management of costs under the performance contract; or a shared savings agreement with a private energy service company. All such contracts shall be known as energy performance contracts. PHAs may extend an executed energy performance contract with a term of less than 20 years to a term of not more than 20 years, to permit additional energy conservation improvements without the reprocurement of energy performance contractors. The PHA must obtain HUD approval to extend the term of an executed energy performance contract.
(1)
Frozen rolling base.
(i) If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are approved by HUD, the RBCL for the project and the utilities involved may be frozen during the contract period. Before the RBCL is frozen, it must be adjusted to reflect any energy savings resulting from the use of any HUD funding. The RBCL also may be adjusted to reflect systems repaired to meet applicable building and safety codes as well as to reflect adjustments for occupancy rates increased by rehabilitation. The RBCL shall be frozen at the level calculated for the year during which the conservation measures initially shall be implemented.
(ii) The PHA operating subsidy eligibility shall reflect the retention of 100 percent of the savings from decreased consumption until the term of the financing agreement is complete. The PHA must use at least 75 percent of the cost savings to pay off the debt,
e.g.
, pay off the contractor or bank loan. If less than 75 percent of the cost savings is used for debt payment, however, HUD shall retain the difference between the actual percentage of cost savings used to pay off the debt and 75 percent of the cost savings. If at least 75 percent of the cost savings is paid to the contractor or bank, the PHA may use the full amount of the remaining cost savings for any eligible operating expense.
(iii) The annual three-year rolling base procedures for computing the RBCL shall be reactivated after the PHA satisfies the conditions of the contract. The three years of consumption data to be used in calculating the RBCL after the end of the contract period shall be the yearly consumption levels for the final three years of the contract.
(2) PHAs undertaking energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD may include resident-paid utilities under the consumption reduction incentive, using the following methodology:
(i) The PHA reviews and updates all utility allowances to ascertain that
residents are receiving the proper allowances before energy savings measures are begun;
(ii) The PHA makes future calculations of rental income for purposes of the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility based on these baseline allowances. In effect, HUD will freeze the baseline allowances for the duration of the contract;
(iii) After implementation of the energy conservation measures, the PHA updates the utility allowances in accordance with provisions in 24 CFR part 965, subpart E. The new allowance should be lower than baseline allowances;
(iv) The PHA uses at least 75 percent of the savings for paying the cost of the improvement (the PHA will be permitted to retain 100 percent of the difference between the baseline allowances and revised allowances);
(v) After the completion of the contract period, the PHA begins using the revised allowances in calculating its operating subsidy eligibility; and
(vi) The PHA may exclude from its calculation of rental income the increased rental income due to the difference between the baseline allowances and the revised allowances of the projects involved, for the duration of the contract period.
(3)
Subsidy add-on.
(i) If a PHA qualifies for this incentive (i.e., the subsidy add-on, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section), then the PHA is eligible for additional operating subsidy each year of the contract to amortize the cost of the loan for the energy conservation measures and other direct costs related to the energy project under the contract during the term of the contract subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The PHA's operating subsidy for the current funding year will continue to be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 990.170 (
i.e.
, the rolling base is not frozen). The PHA will be able to retain part of the cost savings in accordance with § 990.170(c).
(ii) The actual cost of energy (of the type affected by the energy conservation measure) after implementation of the energy conservation measure will be subtracted from the expected energy cost, to produce the energy cost savings for the year.
(iii) If the cost savings for any year during the contract period are less than the amount of operating subsidy to be made available under this paragraph to pay for the energy conservation measure in that year, the deficiency will be offset against the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility for the PHA's next fiscal year.
(iv) If energy cost savings are less than the amount necessary to meet amortization payments specified in a contract, the contract term may be extended (up to the 20-year limit) if HUD determines that the shortfall is the result of changed circumstances, rather than a miscalculation or misrepresentation of projected energy savings by the contractor or PHA. The contract term may be extended only to accommodate payment to the contractor and associated direct costs.
(b)
Rate reduction.
If a PHA takes action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings, such as well-head purchase of natural gas, administrative appeals, or legal action to reduce the rate it pays for utilities, then the PHA will be permitted to retain one-half the annual savings realized from these actions.
(c)
Utility benchmarking.
HUD will pursue benchmarking utility consumption at the project level as part of the transition to asset management. HUD intends to establish benchmarks by collecting utility consumption and cost information on a project-by-project basis. In 2009, after conducting a feasibility study, HUD will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders to review utility benchmarking options so that HUD may determine whether or how to implement utility benchmarking to be effective in FY 2011. The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). The HUD study shall take into account typical levels of utilities consumption at public housing developments based upon factors such as building and unit type and size,
temperature zones, age and construction of building, and other relevant factors.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 61352, Oct. 16, 2008]
§ 990.190
Other formula expenses (add-ons).
In addition to calculating operating subsidy based on the PEL and UEL, a PHA's eligible formula expenses shall be increased by add-ons. The allowed add-ons are:
(a)
Self-sufficiency.
A PHA may request operating subsidy for the reasonable cost of program coordinator(s) and associated costs in accordance with HUD's self-sufficiency program regulations and notices.
(b)
Energy loan amortization.
A PHA may qualify for operating subsidy for payments of principal and interest cost for energy conservation measures described in § 990.185(a)(3).
(c)
Payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT).
Each PHA will receive an amount for PILOT in accordance with section 6(d) of the 1937 Act, based on its cooperation agreement or its latest actual PILOT payment.
(d)
Cost of independent audits.
A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs for the Operating Fund Program when an audit is required by the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) (see 2 CFR part 200, subpart F) or when a PHA elects to prepare and submit such an audit to HUD. For the purpose of this rule, the most recent actual audit costs include the associated costs of an audit for the Operating Fund Program only. A PHA whose operating subsidy is determined to be zero based on the formula is still eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs. The most recent actual audit costs are used as a proxy to cover the cost of the next audit. If a PHA does not have a recent actual audit cost, the PHA working with HUD may establish an audit cost. A PHA that requests funding for an audit shall complete an audit. The results of the audit shall be transmitted in a time and manner prescribed by HUD.
(e)
Funding for resident participation activities.
Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $25 per occupied unit per year for resident participation activities, including, but not limited to, those described in 24 CFR part 964. For purposes of this section, a unit is eligible to receive resident participation funding if it is occupied by a public housing resident or it is occupied by a PHA employee, or a police officer or other security personnel who is not otherwise eligible for public housing. In any fiscal year, if appropriations are not sufficient to meet all funding requirements under this part, then the resident participation component of the formula will be adjusted accordingly.
(f)
Asset management fee.
Each PHA with at least 250 units shall receive a $4 PUM asset management fee. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to transition to asset management shall receive an asset management fee of $2 PUM. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to have their entire portfolio treated and considered as a single project as described in § 990.260(b) or PHAs with only one project will not be eligible for an asset management fee. For all PHAs eligible to receive the asset management fee, the fee will be based on the total number of ACC units. PHAs that are not in compliance with asset management as described in subpart H of this part by FY 2011 will forfeit this fee.
(g)
Information technology fee.
Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $2 PUM for costs attributable to information technology. For all PHAs, this fee will be based on the total number of ACC units.
(h)
Asset repositioning fee.
(1) A PHA that transitions projects or entire buildings of a project out of its inventory is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee. This fee supplements the costs associated with administration and management of demolition or disposition, tenant relocation, and minimum protection and service associated with such efforts. The asset-repositioning fee is not intended for individual units within a multi-unit building undergoing similar activities.
(2) Projects covered by applications approved for demolition or disposition shall be eligible for an asset repositioning fee on the first day of the next quarter six months after the date
the first unit becomes vacant after the relocation date included in the approved relocation plan. When this condition is met, the project and all associated units are no longer considered an EUM as described in § 990.155. Each PHA is responsible for accurately applying and maintaining supporting documentation on the start date of this transition period or is subject to forfeiture of this add-on.
(3) Units categorized for demolition and which are eligible for an asset repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months, 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months, and 25 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.
(4) Units categorized for disposition and which are eligible for an asset repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months and 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.
(5) The following is an example of how eligibility for an asset-repositioning fee is determined:
(i) A PHA has HUD's approval to demolish (or dispose of) a 100-unit project from its 1,000 unit inventory. On January 12th, in conjunction with the PHA's approved Relocation Plan, a unit in that project becomes vacant. Accordingly, the demolition/disposition-approved project is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee on October 1st. (This date is calculated as follows: January 12th + six months = July 12th. The first day of the next quarter is October 1st.)
(ii) Although payment of the asset-repositioning fee will not begin until October 1st, the PHA will receive its full operating subsidy based on the 1,000 units through September 30th. On October 1st the PHA will begin to receive the 36-month asset-repositioning fee in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the 100 units approved for demolition. (Asset repositioning fee requirements for projects approved for disposition are found in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.) On October 1st, the PHA's units will be 900.
(i)
Costs attributable to changes in Federal law, regulation, or economy.
In the event that HUD determines that enactment of a Federal law or revision in HUD or other Federal regulations has caused or will cause a significant change in expenditures of a continuing nature above the PEL and UEL, HUD may, at HUD's sole discretion, decide to prescribe a procedure under which the PHA may apply for or may receive an adjustment in operating subsidy.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]

# Subpart D—Calculating Formula Income
§ 990.195
Calculation of formula income.
(a)
General.
For the purpose of the formula, formula income is equal to the amount of rent charged to tenants divided by the respective unit months leased, and is therefore expressed as a PUM. Formula income will be derived from a PHA's year-end financial information. The financial information used in the formula income computation will be the audited information provided by the PHA through HUD's information systems. The information will be calculated using the following PHA fiscal year-end information:
(1) April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004;
(2) July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004;
(3) October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2004; and
(4) January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2004.
(b)
Calculation of formula income.
To calculate formula income in whole dollars, the PUM amount will be multiplied by the EUMs as described in subpart B of this part.
(c)
Frozen at 2004 level.
After a PHA's formula income is calculated as described in paragraph (a) of this section, it will not be recalculated or inflated for fiscal years 2007 through 2009, unless a PHA can show a severe local economic hardship that is impacting the PHA's ability to maintain some semblance of its formula income (see subpart G of this part—Appeals). A PHA's formula income may be recalculated if the PHA appeals to HUD for an adjustment in its formula.
(d)
Calculation of formula income when data are inadequate or unavailable.
When
audited data are unavailable in HUD's information systems for the calculation of formula income, HUD may use an alternative methodology, including, but not limited to, certifications, hard copy reports, and communications with the respective PHAs.
(e)
Inapplicability of 24 CFR 85.25 (as revised April 1, 2013).
Formula income is not subject to the provisions regarding program income in 24 CFR 85.25 (as revised April 1, 2013).
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005; 70 FR 61367, Oct. 24, 2005; 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]

# Subpart E—Determination and Payment of Operating Subsidy
§ 990.200
Determination of formula amount.
(a)
General.
The amount of operating subsidy that a PHA is eligible for is the difference between its formula expenses (as calculated under subpart C of this part) and its formula income (as calculated under subpart D of this part).
(b)
Use of HUD databases to calculate formula amount.
HUD shall utilize its databases to make the formula calculations. HUD's databases are intended to be employed to provide information on all primary factors in determining the operating subsidy amount. Each PHA is responsible for supplying accurate information on the status of each of its units in HUD's databases.
(c)
PHA responsibility to submit timely data.
PHAs shall submit data used in the formula on a regular and timely basis to ensure accurate calculation under the formula. If a PHA fails to provide accurate data, HUD will make a determination as to the PHA's inventory, occupancy, and financial information using available or verified data, which may result in a lower operating subsidy. HUD has the right to adjust any or all formula amounts based on clerical, mathematical, and information system errors that affect any of the data elements used in the calculation of the formula.
§ 990.205
Fungibility of operating subsidy between projects.
(a)
General.
Operating subsidy shall remain fully fungible between ACC projects until operating subsidy is calculated by HUD at a project level. After subsidy is calculated at a project level, operating subsidy can be transferred as the PHA determines during the PHA's fiscal year to another ACC project(s) if a project's financial information, as described more fully in § 990.280, produces excess cash flow, and only in the amount up to those excess cash flows.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and subject to all of the other provisions of this part, the New York City Housing Authority's Development Grant Project Amendment Number 180, dated July 13, 1995, to Consolidated Annual Contributions Contract NY-333, remains in effect.
§ 990.210
Payment of operating subsidy.
(a)
Payments of operating subsidy under the formula.
HUD shall make monthly payments equal to
1/12
of a PHA's total annual operating subsidy under the formula by electronic funds transfers through HUD's automated disbursement system. HUD shall establish thresholds that permit PHAs to request monthly installments. Requests by PHAs that exceed these thresholds will be subject to HUD review. HUD approvals of requests that exceed these thresholds are limited to PHAs that have an unanticipated and immediate need for disbursement.
(b)
Payments procedure.
In the event that the amount of operating subsidy has not been determined by HUD as of the beginning of the funding period, operating subsidy shall be provided monthly, quarterly, or annually based on the amount of the PHA's previous year's formula or another amount that HUD may determine to be appropriate.
(c)
Availability of funds.
In the event that insufficient funds are available, HUD shall have discretion to revise, on a pro rata basis, the amounts of operating subsidy to be paid to PHAs.
§ 990.215
Payments of operating subsidy conditioned upon reexamination of income of families in occupancy.
(a)
General.
Each PHA is required to reexamine the income of each family in accordance with the provisions of the
ACC, the 1937 Act, and HUD regulations. Income reexaminations shall be performed annually, except as provided in the 1937 Act, in HUD regulations, or in the MTW agreements. A PHA must be in compliance with all reexamination requirements in order to be eligible to receive full operating subsidy. A PHA's calculations of rent and utility allowances shall be accurate and timely.
(b)
A PHA in compliance.
A PHA shall submit a certification that states that the PHA is in compliance with the annual income reexamination requirements and its rent and utility allowance calculations have been or will be adjusted in accordance with current HUD requirements and regulations.
(c)
A PHA not in compliance.
Any PHA not in compliance with annual income reexamination requirements at the time of the submission of the calculation of operating subsidy shall furnish to the responsible HUD field office a copy of the procedures it is using to achieve compliance and a statement of the number of families that have undergone reexamination during the 12 months preceding the current funding cycle. If, on the basis of this submission or any other information, HUD determines that the PHA is not substantially in compliance with all of the annual income reexamination requirements, HUD shall withhold payments to which the PHA may be entitled under this part. Payment may be withheld in an amount equal to HUD's estimate of the loss of rental income to the PHA resulting from its failure to comply with the requirements.

# Subpart F—Transition Policy and Transition Funding
§ 990.220
Purpose.
This policy is aimed at assisting all PHAs in transitioning to the new funding levels as determined by the formula set forth in this rule. PHAs will be subject to a transition funding policy that will either increase or reduce their total operating subsidy for a given year.
§ 990.225
Transition determination.
The determination of the amount and period of the transition funding shall be based on the difference in subsidy levels between the formula set forth in this part and the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula set forth in this part. The difference in subsidy levels will be calculated using FY 2004 data. When actual data are not available for one of the formula components needed to calculate the formula of this part for FY 2004, HUD will use alternate data as a substitute (
e.g.
, unit months available for eligible unit months, etc.) If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA shall have its operating subsidy reduced as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to a transition policy as indicated in § 990.230. If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA will have its operating subsidy increased as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to the transition policy as indicated in § 990.235.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005; 70 FR 61367, Oct. 24, 2005]
§ 990.230
PHAs that will experience a subsidy reduction.
(a) For PHAs that will experience a reduction in their operating subsidy, as determined in § 990.225, such reductions will have a limit of:
(1) 5 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the first year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;
(2) 24 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the second year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;
(3) 43 percent of the difference between the two levels in the third year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;
(4) 62 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fourth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part; and
(5) 81 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fifth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.
(b) The full amount of the reduction in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the sixth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.
(c) For example, a PHA has a subsidy reduction from $1 million, under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part, to $900,000, under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million − $900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy reduction would be limited to $5,000 (5 percent of the difference). Thus, the PHA would receive an operating subsidy amount pursuant to this rule plus a transition-funding amount of $95,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $5,000 reduction limit).
(d) If a PHA can demonstrate a successful conversion to the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part, as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will discontinue the reduction at the PHA's next subsidy calculation following such demonstration, as reflected in the schedule in paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding § 990.290(c).
(e) The schedule for successful demonstration of conversion to asset management for discontinuation of PHA subsidy reduction is reflected in the table below:

Calendar Year 2011 and thereafter.
(f)(1) For purposes of this section, compliance with the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part will be based on an independent assessment conducted by a HUD-approved professional familiar with property management practices in the region or state in which the PHA is located.
(2) A PHA must select from a list of HUD-approved professionals to conduct the independent assessment. The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination of compliance with the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part.
(3) Upon completion of the independent assessment, the assessor shall conduct an exit conference with the PHA. In response to the exit conference, the PHA may submit a management response and other pertinent information (including, but not limited to, an additional assessment procured at the PHAs' own expense) within ten working days of the exit conference to be included in the report submitted to HUD.
(4) In the event that HUD is unable to produce a list of independent assessors on a timely basis, the PHA may submit its own demonstration of a successful conversion to asset management directly to HUD for determination of compliance.
(5) The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) shall consider all information submitted and respond with a final determination of compliance within 60 days of the independent assessor's report being submitted to HUD.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005; 70 FR 61367, Oct. 24, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 45874, Aug. 15, 2007]
§ 990.235
PHAs that will experience a subsidy increase.
(a) For PHAs that will experience a gain in their operating subsidy, as determined in § 990.225, such increases will have a limit of 50 percent of the
difference between the two funding levels in the first year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.
(b) The full amount of the increase in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the second year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.
(c) For example, a PHA's subsidy increased from $900,000 under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part to $1 million under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million−$900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy increase would be limited to $50,000 (50 percent of the difference). Thus, in this example the PHA will receive the operating subsidy amount of this rule minus a transition-funding amount of $50,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $50,000 transition amount).
(d) The schedule for a PHA whose subsidy would be increased is reflected in the table below.

# Subpart G—Appeals
§ 990.240
General.
(a) PHAs will be provided opportunities for appeals. HUD will provide up to a two percent hold-back of the Operating Fund appropriation for FY 2006 and FY 2007. HUD will use the hold-back amount to fund appeals that are filed during each of these fiscal years. Hold-back funds not utilized will be added back to the formula within each of the affected fiscal years.
(b) Appeals are voluntary and must cover an entire portfolio, not single projects. However, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) has the discretion to accept appeals of less than an entire portfolio for PHAs with greater than 5,000 public housing units.
§ 990.245
Types of appeals.
(a)
Streamlined appeal.
This appeal would demonstrate that the application of a specific Operating Fund formula component has a blatant and objective flaw.
(b)
Appeal of formula income for economic hardship.
After a PHA's formula income has been frozen, the PHA can appeal to have its formula income adjusted to reflect a severe local economic hardship that is impacting the PHA's ability to maintain rental and other revenue.
(c)
Appeal for specific local conditions.
This appeal would be based on demonstrations that the model's predictions are not reliable because of specific local conditions. To be eligible, the affected PHA must demonstrate a variance of ten percent or greater in its PEL.
(d)
Appeal for changing market conditions.
A PHA may appeal to receive operating subsidy for vacant units due to changing market conditions, after a PHA has taken aggressive marketing and outreach measures to rent these units. For example, a PHA could appeal if it is located in an area experiencing population loss or economic dislocations that faces a lack of demand for housing in the foreseeable future.
(e)
Appeal to substitute actual project cost data.
A PHA may appeal its PEL if it can produce actual project cost data derived from actual asset management, as outlined in subpart H of this part, for a period of at least two years.
§ 990.250
Requirements for certain appeals.
(a) Appeals under § 990.245 (a) and (c) must be submitted once annually. Appeals under § 990.245 (a) and (c) must be submitted for new projects entering a PHA's inventory within one year of the applicable Date of Full Availability (DOFA).
(b) Appeals under § 990.245 (c) and (e) are subject to the following requirements:
(1) The PHA is required to acquire an independent cost assessment of its projects;
(2) The cost of services for the independent cost assessment is to be paid by the appellant PHA;
(3) The assessment is to be reviewed by a professional familiar with property management practices and costs in the region or state in which the appealing PHA is located. This professional is to be procured by HUD. The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination; and
(4) If the appeal is granted, the PHA agrees to be bound to the independent cost assessment regardless of new funding levels.

# Subpart H—Asset Management
§ 990.255
Overview.
(a) PHAs shall manage their properties according to an asset management model, consistent with the management norms in the broader multi-family management industry. PHAs shall also implement project-based management, project-based budgeting, and project-based accounting, which are essential components of asset management. The goals of asset management are to:
(1) Improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of managing public housing assets;
(2) Better preserve and protect each asset;
(3) Provide appropriate mechanisms for monitoring performance at the property level; and
(4) Facilitate future investment and reinvestment in public housing by public and private sector entities.
(b) HUD recognizes that appropriate changes in its regulatory and monitoring programs may be needed to support PHAs to undertake the goals identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 990.260
Applicability.
(a) PHAs that own and operate 250 or more dwelling rental units under title I of the 1937 Act, including units managed by a third-party entity (for example, a resident management corporation) but excluding section 8 units, are required to operate using an asset management model consistent with this subpart.
(b) PHAs that own and operate fewer than 250 dwelling rental units may treat their entire portfolio as a single project. However, if a PHA selects this option, it will not receive the add-on for the asset management fee described in § 990.190(f).
§ 990.265
Identification of projects.
For purposes of this subpart, project means a public housing building or set of buildings grouped for the purpose of management. A project may be as identified under the ACC or may be a reasonable grouping of projects or portions of a project under the ACC. HUD shall retain the right to disapprove of a PHA's designation of a project. PHAs may group up to 250 scattered-site dwelling rental units into a single project.
§ 990.270
Asset management.
As owners, PHAs have asset management responsibilities that are above and beyond property management activities. These responsibilities include decision-making on topics such as long-term capital planning and allocation, the setting of ceiling or flat rents, review of financial information and physical stock, property management performance, long-term viability of properties, property repositioning and replacement strategies, risk management responsibilities pertaining to regulatory compliance, and those decisions otherwise consistent with the PHA's ACC responsibilities, as appropriate.
§ 990.275
Project-based management (PBM).
PBM is the provision of property-based management services that is tailored to the unique needs of each property, given the resources available to that property. These property management services include, but are not limited to, marketing, leasing, resident services, routine and preventive maintenance, lease enforcement, protective services, and other tasks associated with the day-to-day operation of rental housing at the project level. Under PBM, these property management services are arranged, coordinated, or overseen by management personnel who have been assigned responsibility for the day-to-day operation of that property and who are charged with direct
oversight of operations of that property. Property management services may be arranged or provided centrally; however, in those cases in which property management services are arranged or provided centrally, the arrangement or provision of these services must be done in the best interests of the property, considering such factors as cost and responsiveness.
§ 990.280
Project-based budgeting and accounting.
(a) All PHAs covered by this subpart shall develop and maintain a system of budgeting and accounting for each project in a manner that allows for analysis of the actual revenues and expenses associated with each property. Project-based budgeting and accounting will be applied to all programs and revenue sources that support projects under an ACC (
e.g.
, the Operating Fund, the Capital Fund, etc.).
(b)(1) Financial information to be budgeted and accounted for at a project level shall include all data needed to complete project-based financial statements in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), including revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity data. The PHA shall also maintain all records to support those financial transactions. At the time of conversion to project-based accounting, a PHA shall apportion its assets, liabilities, and equity to its respective projects and HUD-accepted central office cost centers.
(2) Provided that the PHA complies with GAAP and other associated laws and regulations pertaining to financial management (
e.g.,
2 CFR part 200it shall have the maximum amount of responsibility and flexibility in implementing project-based accounting.
(3) Project-specific operating income shall include, but is not limited to, such items as project-specific operating subsidy, dwelling and non-dwelling rental income, excess utilities income, and other PHA or HUD-identified income that is project-specific for management purposes.
(4) Project-specific operating expenses shall include, but are not limited to, direct administrative costs, utilities costs, maintenance costs, tenant services, protective services, general expenses, non-routine or capital expenses, and other PHA or HUD-identified costs which are project-specific for management purposes. Project-specific operating costs also shall include a property management fee charged to each project that is used to fund operations of the central office. Amounts that can be charged to each project for the property management fee must be reasonable. If the PHA contracts with a private management company to manage a project, the PHA may use the difference between the property management fee paid to the private management company and the fee that is reasonable to fund operations of the central office and other eligible purposes.
(5) If the project has excess cash flow available after meeting all reasonable operating needs of the property, the PHA may use this excess cash flow for the following purposes:
(i) Fungibility between projects as provided for in § 990.205.
(ii) Charging each project a reasonable asset management fee that may also be used to fund operations of the central office. However, this asset management fee may be charged only if the PHA performs all asset management activities described in this subpart (including project-based management, budgeting, and accounting). Asset management fees are considered a direct expense.
(iii) Other eligible purposes.
(c) In addition to project-specific records, PHAs may establish central office cost centers to account for non-project specific costs (
e.g.
, human resources, Executive Director's office, etc.). These costs shall be funded from the property-management fees received from each property, and from the asset management fees to the extent these are available.
(d) In the case where a PHA chooses to centralize functions that directly support a project (
e.g.
, central maintenance), it must charge each project using a fee-for-service approach. Each project shall be charged for the actual services received and only to the extent that such amounts are reasonable.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 990.285
Records and reports.
(a) Each PHA shall maintain project-based budgets and fiscal year-end financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and shall make these budgets and financial statements available for review upon request by interested members of the public.
(b) Each PHA shall distribute the project-based budgets and year-end financial statements to the Chairman and to each member of the PHA Board of Commissioners, and to such other state and local public officials as HUD may specify.
(c) Some or all of the project-based budgets and financial statements and information shall be required to be submitted to HUD in a manner and time prescribed by HUD.
§ 990.290
Compliance with asset management requirements.
(a) A PHA is considered in compliance with asset management requirements if it can demonstrate substantially, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, that it is managing according to this subpart.
(b) Demonstration of compliance with asset management will be based on an independent assessment.
(1) The assessment is to be conducted by a professional familiar with property management practices and costs in the region or state in which the PHA is located. This professional is to be procured by HUD.
(2) The professional review and recommendation will then be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (or designee) for final determination of compliance to asset management.
(c) Upon HUD's determination of successful compliance with asset management, PHAs will then be funded based on this information pursuant to § 990.165(i).
(d) PHAs must be in compliance with the project-based accounting and budgeting requirements in this subpart by FY 2007. PHAs must be in compliance with the remainder of the components of asset management by FY 2011.

# Subpart I—Operating Subsidy for Properties Managed by Resident Management Corporations (RMCs)
§ 990.295
Resident Management Corporation operating subsidy.
(a)
General.
This part applies to all projects managed by a Resident Management Corporation (RMC), including a direct funded RMC.
(b)
Operating subsidy.
Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of operating subsidy that a PHA or HUD provides a project managed by an RMC shall not be reduced during the three-year period beginning on the date the RMC first assumes management responsibility for the project.
(c)
Change factors.
The operating subsidy for an RMC-managed project shall reflect changes in inflation, utility rates, and consumption, as well as changes in the number of units in the resident managed project.
(d)
Exclusion of increased income.
Any increased income directly generated by activities by the RMC or facilities operated by the RMC shall be excluded from the calculation of the operating subsidy.
(e)
Exclusion of technical assistance.
Any technical assistance the PHA provides to the RMC will not be included for purposes of determining the amount of funds provided to a project under paragraph (b) of this section.
(f) The following conditions may not affect the amounts to be provided under this part to a project managed by an RMC:
(1)
Income reduction.
Any reduction in the subsidy or total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the PHA; and
(2)
Change in total income.
Any change in the total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of project-specific characteristics when these characteristics are not shared by the project managed by the RMC.
(g)
Other project income.
In addition to the operating subsidy calculated in accordance with this part and the amount of income derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges), the management contract between the PHA and the RMC may
specify that income be provided to the project from other legally available sources of PHA income.
§ 990.300
Preparation of operating budget.
(a) The RMC and the PHA must submit operating budgets and calculations of operating subsidy to HUD for approval in accordance with § 990.200. The budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify the expenditures related to the responsibilities of the RMC and the expenditures that are related to the functions that the PHA will continue to perform.
(b) For each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the RMC, the PHA will transfer into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the PHA an operating reserve for the RMC project. When all maintenance responsibilities for a resident-managed project are the responsibility of the RMC, the amount of the reserve made available to a project under this subpart will be the per-unit cost amount available to the PHA operating reserve, excluding all inventories, prepaids, and receivables at the end of the PHA fiscal year preceding implementation, multiplied by the number of units in the project operated. When some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the RMC, the management contract between the PHA and RMC may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the RMC's sub-account.
(c) The RMC's use of the operating reserve is subject to all administrative procedures applicable to the conventionally owned public housing program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve must be for eligible expenditures that are incorporated into an operating budget subject to approval by HUD.
(d) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with HUD regulations and guidance.
§ 990.305
Retention of excess revenues.
(a) Any income generated by an RMC that exceeds the income estimated for the income categories specified in the RMC's management contract must be excluded in subsequent years in calculating:
(1) The operating subsidy provided to a PHA under this part; and
(2) The funds the PHA provides to the RMC.
(b) The RMC's management contract must specify the amount of income that is expected to be derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges) and the amount of income to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the PHA (such as operating subsidy under this part, interest income, administrative fees, and rents). These income estimates must be calculated consistent with HUD's administrative instructions. Income estimates may provide for adjustment of anticipated project income between the RMC and the PHA, based upon the management and other project-associated responsibilities (if any) that are to be retained by the PHA under the management contract.
(c) Any revenues retained by an RMC under this section may be used only for purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the project, establishing business enterprises that employ residents of public housing, or acquiring additional dwelling units for lower income families. Units acquired by the RMC will not be eligible for payment of operating subsidy.

# Subpart J—Financial Management Systems, Monitoring, and Reporting
§ 990.310
Purpose—General policy on financial management, monitoring and reporting.
All PHA financial management systems, reporting, and monitoring of program performance and financial reporting shall be in compliance with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200. Certain HUD requirements provide exceptions for additional specialized procedures that are determined by HUD to be necessary for the proper management of the program in accordance with the requirements of the 1937 Act and the ACC between each PHA and HUD.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 990.315
Submission and approval of operating budgets.
(a) Required documentation:
(1) Prior to the beginning of its fiscal year, a PHA shall prepare an operating budget in a manner prescribed by HUD. The PHA's Board of Commissioners shall review and approve the budget by resolution. Each fiscal year, the PHA shall submit to HUD, in a time and manner prescribed by HUD, the approved Board resolution.
(2) HUD may direct the PHA to submit its complete operating budget with detailed supporting information and the Board resolution if the PHA has breached the ACC contract, or for other reasons, which, in HUD's determination, threaten the PHA's future serviceability, efficiency, economy, or stability. When the PHA no longer is operating in a manner that threatens the future serviceability, efficiency, economy, or stability of the housing it operates, HUD will notify the PHA that it no longer is required to submit a complete operating budget with detailed supporting information to HUD for review and approval.
(b) If HUD finds that an operating budget is incomplete, inaccurate, includes illegal or ineligible expenditures, contains mathematical errors or errors in the application of accounting procedures, or is otherwise unacceptable, HUD may, at any time, require the PHA to submit additional or revised information regarding the budget or revised budget.
§ 990.320
Audits.
All PHAs that receive financial assistance under this part shall submit an acceptable audit and comply with the audit requirements in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
[70 FR 54997, Sept. 19, 2005, as amended at 80 FR 75943, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 990.325
Record retention requirements.
The PHA shall retain all documents related to all financial management and activities funded under the Operating Fund for a period of five fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the funds were received.

# Source:
63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

# Subpart A—General
§ 1000.1
What is the applicability and scope of these regulations?
Under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101
et seq.
) (NAHASDA) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides grants, loan guarantees, and technical assistance to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for the development and operation of low-income housing in Indian areas. The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible recipients under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. This part also applies to loan guarantee assistance under title VI of NAHASDA. The regulations in this part supplement the statutory requirements set forth in NAHASDA. This part, as much as practicable, does not repeat statutory language.
§ 1000.2
What are the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA?
(a) The Secretary shall use the following Congressional findings set forth in section 2 of NAHASDA as the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA:
(1) The Federal government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation:
(i) By using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;
(ii) By working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and
(iii) By developing effective partnerships among the Federal government, state, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities.
(2) There exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people.
(3) The Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people.
(4) The Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition.
(5) Providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the
United States in helping Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status.
(6) The need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the federal government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for Indian tribes and their members.
(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450
et seq.
).
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as releasing the United States government from any responsibility arising under its trust responsibilities towards Indians or any treaty or treaties with an Indian tribe or nation.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 77 FR 71521, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.4
What are the objectives of NAHASDA?
The primary objectives of NAHASDA are:
(a) To assist and promote affordable housing activities to develop, maintain and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by low-income Indian families;
(b) To ensure better access to private mortgage markets for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;
(c) To coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;
(d) To plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for Indian tribes; and
(e) To promote the development of private capital markets in Indian country and to allow such markets to operate and grow, thereby benefiting Indian communities.
§ 1000.6
What is the nature of the IHBG program?
The IHBG program is formula driven whereby eligible recipients of funding receive an equitable share of appropriations made by the Congress, based upon formula components specified under subpart D of this part. IHBG recipients must have the administrative capacity to undertake the affordable housing activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.
§ 1000.8
May provisions of these regulations be waived?
Yes. Upon determination of good cause, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this part and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)).
§ 1000.9
How is negotiated rulemaking conducted when promulgating NAHASDA regulations?
The negotiated rulemaking procedures and requirements set out in section 106(b) of NAHASDA shall be conducted as follows:
(a)
Committee membership.
In forming a negotiated rulemaking committee, HUD shall appoint as committee members representatives of the Federal Government and representatives of diverse tribes and program recipients.
(b)
Initiation of rulemaking.
HUD shall initiate a negotiated rulemaking not later than 90 days after the enactment of any act to reauthorize or significantly amend NAHASDA.
(c)
Work groups.
Negotiated rulemaking committees may form workgroups made up of committee members and other interested parties
to meet during committee sessions and between sessions to develop specific rulemaking proposals for committee consideration.
(d)
Further review.
Negotiated rulemaking committees shall provide recommended rules to HUD. Once rules are proposed by HUD, they shall be published for comment in the
Federal Register.
Any comments will be further reviewed by the committee and HUD before HUD determines if the rule or rules will be adopted.

(f)
Responsibility of recipient.
(1) The recipient shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The recipient shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with the provisions in this section.

(g)
Definition of displaced person.
(1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:
(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an IHP that is later approved.
(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, that the recipient determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.
(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:
(A) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or
(B) 30 percent of gross household income.
(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:
(A) The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or
(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.
(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:
(A) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:
(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the IHP to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project.
(ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).
(iii) The recipient determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.
(3) A recipient may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.
(h)
Definition of initiation of negotiations.
For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition (See 49 CFR part 24).
§ 1000.16
What labor standards are applicable?
(a)
Davis-Bacon wage rates.
(1) As described in section 104(b) of NAHASDA, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale, or lease under NAHASDA must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.
(2) When NAHASDA assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NAHASDA assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.
(3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.
(b)
HUD-determined wage rates.
Section 104(b) also mandates that contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under NAHASDA require that prevailing wages determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable state, tribal or local law) by HUD shall be paid to maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, and to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development, of affordable housing.
(c)
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.
Contracts in excess of $100,000 to which Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply are subject by law to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).
(d)
Volunteers.
The requirements in 24 CFR part 70 concerning exemptions for the use of volunteers on projects subject to Davis-Bacon and HUD-determined wage rates are applicable.
(e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall not apply to any contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease pursuant to NAHASDA, or to any contract for construction, development, operations, or maintenance
thereunder, if such contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease is otherwise covered by one or more laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe that requires the payment of not less than prevailing wages, as determined by the Indian tribe. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall also not apply to work performed directly by tribal or TDHE employees under a contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease, that is covered by one or more such laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe.
(f)
Other laws and issuances.
Recipients, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations issued under the labor standards provisions cited in this section, other applicable Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards, and HUD Handbook 1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs).

§ 1000.18
What environmental review requirements apply?
The environmental effects of each activity carried out with assistance under this part must be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and the related authorities listed in HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. An environmental review does not have to be completed prior to HUD approval of an IHP.
§ 1000.20
Is an Indian tribe required to assume environmental review responsibilities?
(a) No. It is an option an Indian tribe may choose. If an Indian tribe declines to assume the environmental review responsibilities, HUD will perform the environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. The timing of HUD undertaking the environmental review will be subject to the availability of resources. A HUD environmental review must be completed for any NAHASDA assisted activities not excluded from review under 24 CFR 50.19(b) before a recipient may acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair or construct property, or commit HUD or local funds used in conjunction with such NAHASDA assisted activities with respect to the property.
(b) If an Indian tribe assumes environmental review responsibilities:
(1) Its certifying officer must certify that he/she is authorized and consents on behalf of the Indian tribe and such officer to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal courts for the purpose of enforcement of the responsibilities of the certifying officer as set forth in section 105(c) of NAHASDA; and
(2) The Indian tribe must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 58.
(3) No funds may be committed to a grant activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification required by sections 105(b) and 105(c) of NAHASDA, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58 such as for the costs of environmental reviews and other planning and administrative expenses.
(c) Where an environmental assessment (EA) is appropriate under 24 CFR part 50, instead of an Indian tribe assuming environmental review responsibilities under paragraph (b) of this section or HUD preparing the EA itself under paragraph (a) of this section, an Indian tribe or TDHE may prepare an EA for HUD review. In addition to complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 1506.5(a), HUD shall make its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take responsibility for the scope and content of the EA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b).
§ 1000.21
Under what circumstances are waivers of the environmental review procedures available to tribes?
A tribe or recipient may request that the Secretary waive the requirements under section 105 of NAHASDA. The Secretary may grant the waiver if the Secretary determines that a failure on the part of a recipient to comply with provisions of this section:
(a) Will not frustrate the goals of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) or any other provision of law that furthers the goals of that Act;
(b) Does not threaten the health or safety of the community involved by posing an immediate or long-term hazard to residents of that community;
(c) Is a result of inadvertent error, including an incorrect or incomplete certification provided under section 105(c)(1) of NAHASDA; and
(d) May be corrected through the sole action of the recipient.
[77 FR 71522, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.22
Are the costs of the environmental review an eligible cost?
Yes, costs of completing the environmental review are eligible.

If an Indian tribe assumes environmental review responsibility, how will HUD assist the Indian tribe in performing the environmental review?
As set forth in section 105(a)(2)(B) of NAHASDA and 24 CFR 58.77, HUD will provide for monitoring of environmental reviews and will also facilitate training for the performance for such reviews by Indian tribes.
§ 1000.26
What are the administrative requirements under NAHASDA?

There may be circumstances under which the bonding requirements of 2 CFR 200.325 are inconsistent with other responsibilities and obligations of the recipient. In such circumstances, acceptable methods to provide performance and payment assurance may include:
(i) Deposit with the recipient of a cash escrow of not less than 20 percent of the total contract price, subject to reduction during the warranty period, commensurate with potential risk;
(ii) Letter of credit for 25 percent of the total contract price, unconditionally payable upon demand of the recipient, subject to reduction during any warranty period commensurate with potential risk; or

(2) In addition, no person providing consultant services in an employer-employee type of relationship shall receive more than a reasonable rate of compensation for personal services paid with IHBG funds. In no event, however, shall such compensation exceed the equivalent of the daily rate paid for Level IV of the Executive Schedule.

§ 1000.28
May a self-governance Indian tribe be exempted from the applicability of § 1000.26?
Yes. A self-governance Indian tribe shall certify that its administrative requirements, standards and systems meet or exceed the comparable requirements of § 1000.26. For purposes of this section, a self-governance Indian tribe is an Indian tribe that participates in tribal self-governance as authorized under Public Law 93-638, as amended (25 U.S.C. 450

(b)
Conflicts prohibited.
No person who participates in the decision-making process or who gains inside information with regard to NAHASDA assisted activities may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from such activities, except for the use of NAHASDA funds to pay salaries or other related administrative costs.

§ 1000.32
May exceptions be made to the conflict of interest provisions?
(a) Yes. HUD may make exceptions to the conflict of interest provisions set forth in § 1000.30(b) on a case-by-case basis when it determines that such an exception would further the primary objective of NAHASDA and
the effective and efficient implementation of the recipient's program, activity, or project.

§ 1000.34
What factors must be considered in making an exception to the conflict of interest provisions?
In determining whether or not to make an exception to the conflict of interest provisions, HUD must consider whether undue hardship will result, either to the recipient or to the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict.
§ 1000.36
How long must a recipient retain records regarding exceptions made to the conflict of interest provisions?
A recipient must maintain all such records for a period of at least 3 years after an exception is made.

A recipient may define rents and homebuyer payments to exclude utilities.
§ 1000.134
When may a recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) demolish or dispose of current assisted stock?
(a) A recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) may undertake a planned demolition or disposal of current assisted stock owned by the recipient or an entity funded by the recipient when:
(1) A financial analysis demonstrates that it is more cost-effective or housing program-effective for the recipient to demolish or dispose of the unit than to continue to operate or own it; or
(2) The housing unit has been condemned by the government which has authority over the unit; or
(3) The housing unit is an imminent threat to the health and safety of housing residents; or
(4) Continued habitation of a housing unit is inadvisable due to cultural or historical considerations.
(b) No action to demolish or dispose of the property other than performing the analysis cited in paragraph (a) of this section can be taken until HUD has been notified in writing of the recipient's intent to demolish or dispose of the housing units consistent with section 102(c)(4)(H) of NAHASDA. The written notification must set out the analysis used to arrive at the decision to demolish or dispose of the property and may be set out in a recipient's IHP or in a separate submission to HUD.
(c) In any disposition sale of a housing unit, a sale process designed to maximize the sale price will be used. However, where the sale is to a low-income Indian family, the home may be disposed of without maximizing the sale price so long as such price is consistent with a recipient's IHP. The sale proceeds from the disposition of any housing unit are program income under NAHASDA and must be used in accordance with the requirements of NAHASDA and these regulations.

[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.154
How is the recipient to keep criminal conviction information confidential?
(a) The recipient will keep all the criminal conviction record information it receives from the official law enforcement agencies listed in § 1000.150
in files separate from all other housing records.
(b) These criminal conviction records will be kept under lock and key and be under the custody and control of the recipient's housing executive director/lead official and/or his designee for such records.
(c) These criminal conviction records may only be accessed with the written permission of the Indian tribe's or TDHE's housing executive director/lead official and/or his designee and are only to be used for the purposes stated in section 208 of NAHASDA and these regulations.
§ 1000.156
Is affordable housing developed, acquired, or assisted under the IHBG program subject to limitations on cost or design standards?
Yes. Affordable housing must be of moderate design. For these purposes, moderate design is defined as housing that is of a size and with amenities consistent with unassisted housing offered for sale in the Indian tribe's general geographic area to buyers who are at or below the area median income. The local determination of moderate design applies to all housing assisted under an affordable housing activity, including development activities (
e.g.,
acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing and homebuyer assistance) and model activities. Acquisition includes assistance to a family to buy housing. Units with the same number of bedrooms must be comparable with respect to size, cost and amenities.
[66 FR 49790, Sept. 28, 2001]
§ 1000.158
How will a NAHASDA grant recipient know that the housing assisted under the IHBG program meets the requirements of § 1000.156?
(a) A recipient must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if an assisted housing project meets the moderate design requirements of § 1000.156. For purposes of this requirement, a project is one or more housing units, of comparable size, cost, amenities and design, developed with assistance provided by the Act.
(b) The recipient may adopt written standards for its affordable housing programs that reflect the requirement specified in § 1000.156. The standards must describe the type of housing, explain the basis for the standards, and use similar housing in the Indian tribe's general geographic area. For each affordable housing project, the recipient must maintain documentation substantiating compliance with the adopted housing standards. The standards and documentation substantiating compliance for each activity must be available for review by the general public and, upon request, by HUD. Prior to awarding a contract for the construction of housing or beginning construction using its own workforce, the recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC discussed in paragraph (c) of this section and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed by more than 10 percent the TDC maximum cost for the project. In developing standards under this paragraph, the recipient must establish, maintain, and follow policies that determine a local definition of moderate design which considers:
(1) Gross area;
(2) Total cost to provide the housing;
(3) Environmental concerns and mitigations;
(4) Climate;
(5) Comparable housing in geographical area;
(6) Local codes, ordinances and standards;
(7) Cultural relevance in design;
(8) Design and construction features that are reasonable, and necessary to provide decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing; and
(9) Design and construction features that are accessible to persons with a variety of disabilities.
(c) If the recipient has not adopted housing standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Total Development Cost (TDC) limits published periodically by HUD establish the maximum amount of funds (from all sources) that the recipient may use to
develop or acquire/rehabilitate affordable housing. The recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed the TDC maximum cost for the project.
[66 FR 49790, Sept. 28, 2001]
§ 1000.160
Are non-dwelling structures developed, acquired or assisted under the IHBG program subject to limitations on cost or design standards?
Yes. Non-dwelling structures must be of a design, size and with features or amenities that are reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purpose intended by the structures. The purpose of a non-dwelling structure must be to support an affordable housing activity, as defined by the Act.
[66 FR 49790, Sept. 28, 2001]
§ 1000.162
How will a recipient know that non-dwelling structures assisted under the IHBG program meet the requirements of 1000.160?
(a) The recipient must use one of the methods described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if a non-dwelling structure meets the limitation requirements of § 1000.160. If the recipient develops, acquires, or rehabilitates a non-dwelling structure with funds from NAHASDA and other sources, then the cost limit standard established under these regulations applies to the entire structure. If funds are used from two different sources, the standards of the funding source with the more restrictive rules apply.
(b)(1) The recipient may adopt written standards for non-dwelling structures. The standards must describe the type of structures and must clearly describe the criteria to be used to guide the cost, size, design, features, amenities, performance or other factors. The standards for such structures must be able to support the reasonableness and necessity for these factors and to clearly identify the affordable housing activity that is being provided.
(2) When the recipient applies a standard to particular structures, it must document the following: (i) Identification of targeted population to benefit from the structures;
(ii) Identification of need or problem to be solved;
(iii) Affordable housing activity provided or supported by the structures;
(iv) Alternatives considered;
(v) Provision for future growth and change;
(vi) Cultural relevance of design;
(vii) Size and scope supported by population and need;
(viii) Design and construction features that are accessible to persons with a variety of disabilities;
(ix) Cost; and
(x) Compatibility with community infrastructure and services.
(c) If the recipient has not adopted program standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then it must demonstrate and document that the non-dwelling structure is of a cost, size, design and with amenities consistent with similarly designed and constructed structures in the recipient's general geographic area.
[66 FR 49790, Sept. 28, 2001]

# Subpart C—Indian Housing Plan (IHP)
§ 1000.201
How are funds made available under NAHASDA?
Every fiscal year HUD will make grants under the IHBG program to recipients who have submitted to HUD for a tribal program year an IHP in accordance with § 1000.220 to carry out affordable housing activities.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.202
Who are eligible recipients?
Eligible recipients are Indian tribes, or TDHEs when authorized by one or more Indian tribes.
§ 1000.204
How does an Indian tribe designate itself as recipient of the grant?
(a) By resolution of the Indian tribe; or
(b) When such authority has been delegated by an Indian tribe's governing body to a tribal committee(s), by resolution or other written form used by such committee(s) to memorialize the decisions of that body, if applicable.
§ 1000.206
How is a TDHE designated?
(a)(1) By resolution of the Indian tribe or Indian tribes to be served; or
(2) When such authority has been delegated by an Indian tribe's governing body to a tribal committee(s), by resolution or other written form used by such committee(s) to memorialize the decisions of that body, if applicable.
(b) In the absence of a designation by the Indian tribe, the default designation as provided in section 4(21) of NAHASDA shall apply.
§ 1000.208
What happens if an Indian tribe had two IHAs as of September 30, 1996?
Indian tribes which had established and were operating two IHAs as of September 30, 1996, under the 1937 Act shall be allowed to form and operate two TDHEs under NAHASDA. Nothing in this section shall affect the allocation of funds otherwise due to an Indian tribe under the formula.
§ 1000.210
What happens to existing 1937 Act units in those jurisdictions for which Indian tribes do not or cannot submit an IHP?
NAHASDA does not provide the statutory authority for HUD to grant NAHASDA grant funds to an Indian housing authority, Indian tribe or to a default TDHE which cannot obtain a tribal certification, if the requisite IHP is not submitted by an Indian tribe or is determined to be out of compliance by HUD. There may be circumstances where this may happen, and in those cases, other methods of tribal, Federal, or private market support may have to be sought to maintain and operate those 1937 Act units.
§ 1000.212
Is submission of an IHP required?
Yes. An Indian tribe or, with the consent of its Indian tribe(s), the TDHE, must submit an IHP to HUD to receive funding under NAHASDA, except as provided in section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If a TDHE has been designated by more than one Indian tribe, the TDHE can submit a separate IHP for each Indian tribe or it may submit a single IHP based on the requirements of § 1000.220 with the approval of the Indian tribes.
§ 1000.214
What is the deadline for submission of an IHP?
IHPs must be initially sent by the recipient to the Area ONAP no later than 75 days before the beginning of a tribal program year. Grant funds cannot be provided until the plan due under this section is determined to be in compliance with section 102 of NAHASDA and funds are available.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.216
What happens if the recipient does not submit the IHP to the Area ONAP by no later than 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year?
If the IHP is not initially sent by at least 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year, the recipient will not be eligible for IHBG funds for that fiscal year. Any funds not obligated because an IHP was not received before this deadline has passed shall be distributed by formula in the following year.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.218
Who prepares and submits an IHP?
An Indian tribe, or with the authorization of a Indian tribe, in accordance with section 102(d) of NAHASDA a TDHE may prepare and submit a plan to HUD.
§ 1000.220
What are the requirements for the IHP?
The IHP requirements are set forth in section 102(b) of NAHASDA. In addition, §§ 1000.56, 1000.108, 1000.120, 1000.134, 1000.142, 1000.238, 1000.302, and 1000.328 require or permit additional items to be set forth in the IHP for HUD determinations required by those sections. Recipients are only required to provide IHPs that contain these elements in a form prescribed by HUD. If a TDHE is submitting a single IHP that covers two or more Indian tribes, the IHP must contain a separate certification in accordance with section 102(d) of NAHASDA and IHP Tables for each Indian tribe when requested by such Indian tribes. However, Indian tribes are encouraged to perform comprehensive housing needs assessments and develop comprehensive IHPs and
not limit their planning process to only those housing efforts funded by NAHASDA. An IHP should be locally driven.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.222
Are there separate IHP requirements for small Indian tribes and small TDHEs?
No. HUD requirements for IHPs are reasonable.
§ 1000.224
Can any part of the IHP be waived?
Yes. HUD has general authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA to waive any IHP requirements when an Indian tribe cannot comply with IHP requirements due to exigent circumstances beyond its control, for a period of not more than 90 days. The waiver authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA provides flexibility to address the needs of every Indian tribe, including small Indian tribes. The waiver may be requested by the Indian tribe or its TDHE (if such authority is delegated by the Indian tribe), and such waiver shall not be unreasonably withheld.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.225
When may a waiver of the IHP submission deadline be requested?
A recipient may request a waiver for a period of not more than 90 days beyond the IHP submission due date.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.226
Can the certification requirements of section 102(c)(5) of NAHASDA be waived by HUD?
Yes. HUD may waive these certification requirements as provided in section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA.
§ 1000.227
What shall HUD do upon receipt of an IHP submission deadline waiver request?
The waiver shall be decided upon by HUD within 45 days of receipt of the waiver request. HUD shall notify the recipient in writing within 45 days of receipt of the waiver request whether the request is approved or denied.
[77 FR 71526, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.228
If HUD changes its IHP format will Indian tribes be involved?
Yes. HUD will first consult with Indian tribes before making any substantial changes to HUD's IHP format.
§ 1000.230
What is the process for HUD review of IHPs and IHP amendments?
HUD will conduct the IHP review in the following manner:
(a) HUD will conduct a limited review of the IHP to ensure that its contents:
(1) Comply with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA, which outlines the IHP submission requirements; however, the recipient may use either the HUD-estimated IHBG amount or the IHBG amount from their most recent compliant IHP;
(2) Are consistent with information and data available to HUD;
(3) Are not prohibited by or inconsistent with any provision of NAHASDA or other applicable law; and
(4) Include the appropriate certifications.
(b) If the IHP complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of IHP compliance within 60 days after receiving the IHP. If HUD fails to notify the recipient, the IHP shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA and the IHP is approved.
(c) If the submitted IHP does not comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of the determination of non-compliance. HUD will provide this notice no later than 60 days after receiving the IHP. This notice will set forth:
(1) The reasons for noncompliance;
(2) The modifications necessary for the IHP to meet the submission requirements; and
(3) The date by which the revised IHP must be submitted.
(d) If the recipient does not submit a revised IHP by the date indicated in the notice provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the IHP will be determined by HUD to be in non-compliance unless a waiver is requested and approved under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the IHP is determined by
HUD to be in non-compliance and no waiver is granted, the recipient may appeal this determination following the appeal process in § 1000.234.
(e)(1) If the IHP does not contain the certifications identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the recipient will be notified within 60 days of submission of the IHP that the plan is incomplete. The notification will include a date by which the certification must be submitted.
(2) If the recipient has not complied or cannot comply with the certification requirements due to circumstances beyond the control of the Indian tribe(s), within the timeframe established, the recipient can request a waiver in accordance with section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the waiver is approved, the recipient is eligible to receive its grant in accordance with any conditions of the waiver.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.232
Can an Indian tribe or TDHE amend its IHP?
Yes. Section 103(c) of NAHASDA specifically provides that a recipient may submit modifications or revisions of its IHP to HUD. Unless the initial IHP certification provided by an Indian tribe allowed for the submission of IHP amendments without further tribal certifications, a tribal certification must accompany submission of IHP amendments by a TDHE to HUD. HUD's review of an amendment and determination of compliance will be limited to modifications of an IHP which adds new activities or involve a decrease in the amount of funds provided to protect and maintain the viability of housing assisted under the 1937 Act. HUD will consider these modifications to the IHP in accordance with § 1000.230. HUD will act on amended IHPs within 30 days.
§ 1000.234
Can HUD's determination regarding the non-compliance of an IHP or a modification to an IHP be appealed?
(a) Yes. Within 30 days of receiving HUD's disapproval of an IHP or of a modification to an IHP, the recipient may submit a written request for reconsideration of the determination. The request shall include the justification for the reconsideration.
(b) Within 21 days of receiving the request, HUD shall reconsider its initial determination and provide the recipient with written notice of its decision to affirm, modify, or reverse its initial determination. This notice will also contain the reasons for HUD's decision.
(c) The recipient may appeal any denial of reconsideration by filing an appeal with the Assistant Secretary within 21 days of receiving the denial. The appeal shall set forth the reasons why the recipient does not agree with HUD's decision and include justification for the reconsideration.
(d) Within 21 days of receipt of the appeal, the Assistant Secretary shall review the recipient's appeal and act on the appeal. The Assistant Secretary will provide written notice to the recipient setting forth the reasons for the decision. The Assistant Secretary's decision constitutes final agency action.
§ 1000.236
What are eligible administrative and planning expenses?
(a) Eligible administrative and planning expenses of the IHBG program include, but are not limited to:
(1) Costs of overall program and/or administrative management;
(2) Coordination monitoring and evaluation;
(3) Preparation of the IHP including data collection and transition costs;
(4) Preparation of the annual performance report;
(5) Challenge to and collection of data for purposes of challenging the formula; and
(6) Administrative and planning expenses associated with expenditure of non-IHBG funds on affordable housing activities if the source of the non-IHBG funds limits expenditure of its funds on such administrative expenses.
(b) Staff and overhead costs directly related to carrying out affordable housing activities or comprehensive and community development planning activities can be determined to be eligible costs of the affordable housing activity or considered as administration
or planning at the discretion of the recipient.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.238
What percentage of the IHBG funds can be used for administrative and planning expenses?
Recipients receiving in excess of $500,000 may use up to 20 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or may use up to 20 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. Recipients receiving $500,000 or less may use up to 30 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or up to 30 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. When a recipient is receiving grant funds on behalf of one or more grant beneficiaries, the recipient may use up to 30 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 30 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is $500,000 or less, and up to 20 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 20 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is greater than $500,000. HUD approval is required if a higher percentage is requested by the recipient. Recipients combining grant funds with other funding may request HUD approval to use a higher percentage based on its total expenditure of funds from all sources for that year. When HUD approval is required, HUD must take into consideration any cost of preparing the IHP, challenges to and collection of data, the recipient's grant amount, approved cost allocation plans, and any other relevant information with special consideration given to the circumstances of recipients receiving minimal funding.
[77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.239
May a recipient establish and maintain reserve accounts for administration and planning?
Yes. In addition to the amounts established for planning and administrative expenses under §§ 1000.236 and 1000.238, a recipient may establish and maintain separate reserve accounts only for the purpose of accumulating amounts for administration and planning relating to affordable housing activities. These amounts may be invested in accordance with § 1000.58(c). Interest earned on reserves is not program income and shall not be included in calculating the maximum amount of reserves. The maximum amount of reserves, whether in one or more accounts, that a recipient may have available at any one time is calculated as follows:
(a) Determine the 5-year average of administration and planning amounts, not including reserve amounts, expended in a tribal program year.
(b) Establish
1/4
of that amount for the total eligible reserve.
[77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.240
When is a local cooperation agreement required for affordable housing activities?
The requirement for a local cooperation agreement applies only to rental and lease-purchase homeownership units assisted with IHBG funds which are owned by the Indian tribe or TDHE.
§ 1000.242
When does the requirement for exemption from taxation apply to affordable housing activities?
The requirement for exemption from taxation applies only to rental and lease-purchase homeownership units assisted with IHBG funds which are owned by the Indian tribe or TDHE.
§ 1000.244
If the recipient has made a good-faith effort to negotiate a cooperation agreement and tax-exempt status but has been unsuccessful through no fault of its own, may the Secretary waive the requirement for a cooperation agreement and a tax exemption?
Yes. Recipients must submit a written request for waiver to the recipient's Area ONAP. The request must detail a good faith effort by the recipient, identify the housing units involved, and include all pertinent background information about the housing units. The recipient must further demonstrate that it has pursued and exhausted all reasonable channels available to it to reach an agreement to obtain tax-exempt status, and that failure to obtain the required agreement and tax-exempt status has been through no fault of its own. The Area
ONAP will forward the request, its recommendation, comments, and any additional relevant documentation to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native American Programs for processing to the Assistant Secretary.
[77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.246
How must HUD respond to a request for waiver of the requirement for a cooperation agreement and a tax exemption?
(a) HUD shall make a determination to such request for a waiver within 30 days of receipt or provide a reason to the requestor for the delay, identify all additional documentation necessary, and provide a timeline within which a determination will be made.
(b) If the waiver is granted, HUD shall notify the recipient of the waiver in writing and inform the recipient of any special condition or deadlines with which it must comply. Such waiver shall remain effective until revoked by the Secretary.
(c) If the waiver is denied, HUD shall notify the recipient of the denial and the reason for the denial in writing. If the request is denied, IHBG funds may not be spent on the housing units. If IHBG funds have been spent on the housing units prior to the denial, the recipient must reimburse the grant for all IHBG funds expended.
[77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]

# Subpart D—Allocation Formula
§ 1000.301
What is the purpose of the IHBG formula?
The IHBG formula is used to allocate equitably and fairly funds made available through NAHASDA among eligible Indian tribes. A TDHE may be a recipient on behalf of an Indian tribe.
§ 1000.302
What are the definitions applicable for the IHBG formula?
Allowable Expense Level (AEL) factor.
In rental projects, AEL is the per-unit per-month dollar amount of expenses which was used to compute the amount of operating subsidy used prior to October 1, 1997 for the Low Rent units developed under the 1937 Act. The “AEL factor” is the relative difference between a local area AEL and the national weighted average for AEL.
Date of Full Availability (DOFA)
means the last day of the month in which substantially all the units in a housing development are available for occupancy.
Fair Market Rent (FMR) factors
are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent plus the cost of all utilities, except telephones. HUD estimates FMRs on an annual basis for 354 metropolitan FMR areas and 2,355 non-metropolitan county FMR areas. The “FMR factor” is the relative difference between a local area FMR and the national weighted average for FMR.
Formula Annual Income.
For purposes of the IHBG formula, annual income is a household's total income as currently defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Formula area.
(1) Formula areas are:
(i) Reservations for federally recognized Indian tribes, as defined by the U.S. Census;
(ii) Trust lands;
(iii) Department of the Interior Near-Reservation Service Areas;
(iv) Former Indian Reservation Areas in Oklahoma Indian Areas, as defined by the U.S. Census as Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas (OTSAs);
(v) Congressionally Mandated Service Areas;
(vi) State Tribal Areas as defined by the U.S. Census as State Designated American Indian Statistical Areas (SDAISAs);
(vii) Tribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs);
(viii) California Tribal Jurisdictional Areas established or reestablished by federal court judgment; and
(ix) Alaska formula areas described in paragraph (4) of this definition.
(2)(i) For a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, and for expansion or re-definition of a geographic area from the prior year, including those identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, the Indian tribe must submit, on a form agreed to by HUD, information about the geographic area it wishes to include in its Formula Area, including proof that the Indian tribe, where applicable, has agreed to provide housing services pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the tribal and
public governing entity or entities of the area, or has attempted to establish such an MOA, and is providing substantial housing services and will continue to expend or obligate funds for substantial housing services, as reflected in its Indian Housing Plan and Annual Performance Report for this purpose.
(ii) Upon receiving a request for recognition of a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, HUD shall make a preliminary determination. HUD shall notify all potentially affected Indian tribes of the basis for its preliminary determination by certified mail and provide the Indian tribes with the opportunity to comment for a period of not less than 90 days. After consideration of the comments, HUD shall announce its final determination through
Federal Register
notice.
(iii) No Indian tribe may expand or redefine its Formula Area without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) of this definition, notwithstanding any changes recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau.
(iv) The geographic area into which an Indian tribe may expand under this paragraph (2) shall be the smallest U.S. Census unit or units encompassing the physical location where substantial housing services have been provided by the Indian tribe.
(3) Subject to a challenge by an Indian tribe with a Formula Area described under paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition, any federally recognized Indian tribe assigned Formula Area geography in Fiscal Year 2003 not identified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, shall continue to be assigned such Formula Area in subsequent fiscal years, provided that the Indian tribe continues to provide an appropriate level of housing services within the Formula Area as monitored by HUD using the definition of substantial housing services contained in this section as a guideline but not as a requirement.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this definition, Alaska needs data shall be credited as set forth in § 1000.327 to the Alaska Native Village (ANV), the regional Indian tribe, or to the regional corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (33 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
) (ANCSA). For purposes of § 1000.327 and this definition:
(i) The formula area of the ANV shall be the geographic area of the village or that area delineated by the TDSA established for the ANV for purposes of the 1990 U.S. Census or the Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA) established for the ANV. To the extent that the area encompassed by such designation may substantially exceed the actual geographic area of the village, such designation is subject to challenge pursuant to § 1000.336. If the ANVSA or the TDSA is determined pursuant to such challenge to substantially exceed the actual area of the village, then the geographic formula area of the ANV for purposes of § 1000.327 shall be such U.S. Census designation as most closely approximates the actual geographic area of the village.
(ii) The geographic formula area of the regional corporation shall be the area established for the corporation by the ANCSA.
(iii) An Indian tribe may seek to expand its Alaska formula area within its ANCSA region pursuant to the procedures set out in paragraph (2) of this definition. Formula Area added in this way shall be treated as overlapping pursuant to § 1000.326, unless the Indian tribe's members in the expanded area are less than 50 percent of the AIAN population. In cases where the Indian tribe is not treated as overlapping, the Indian tribe shall be credited with population and housing data only for its own tribal member residents within the new or added area. All other population and housing data for the area shall remain with the Indian tribe or tribes previously credited with such data.
(5) In some cases the population data for an Indian tribe within its Formula Area is greater than its tribal enrollment. In general, to maintain fairness for all Indian tribes, the tribe's population data will not be allowed to exceed twice an Indian tribe's enrolled population. However, an Indian tribe subject to this cap may receive an allocation based on more than twice its total enrollment if it can show that it is providing housing assistance to substantially more non-member Indians
and Alaska Natives who are members of another federally recognized Indian tribe than it is to members. For state-recognized Indian tribes, the population data and formula allocation shall be limited to their tribal enrollment figures as determined under enrollment criteria in effect in 1996.
(6) In cases where an Indian tribe is seeking to receive an allocation more than twice its total enrollment, the tribal enrollment multiplier will be determined by the total number of Indians and Alaska Natives to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance (on July 30 of the year before funding is sought) divided by the number of members to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance. For example, an Indian tribe that provides housing to 300 Indians and Alaska Natives, of which 100 are members, the Indian tribe would then be able to receive an allocation for up to three times its tribal enrollment if the Indian and Alaska Native population in the area is three or more times the tribal enrollment.
Formula Median Income.
For purposes of the formula median income is determined in accordance with section 567 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 1437a note).
Formula Response Form
is the form recipients use to report changes to their Formula Current Assisted stock, formula area, and other formula related information before each year's formula allocation.
Indian Housing Authority (IHA) financed
means a homeownership program where title rests with the homebuyer and a security interest rests with the IHA.

Yes, as long as any modification does not conflict with the requirements of NAHASDA.
§ 1000.306
How can the IHBG formula be modified?
(a) The IHBG formula can be modified upon development of a set of measurable and verifiable data directly related to Indian and Alaska Native housing need. Any data set developed shall be compiled with the consultation and involvement of Indian tribes and examined and/or implemented not later than 5 years from the date of issuance of these regulations and periodically thereafter.
(b) The IHBG Formula shall be reviewed not later than May 21, 2012 to determine if a subsidy is needed to operate and maintain NAHASDA units or if any other changes are needed in respect to funding under the Formula Current Assisted Stock component of the formula.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 20024, Apr. 20, 2007; 81 FR 83680, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.308
Who can make modifications to the IHBG formula?
HUD can make modifications in accordance with § 1000.304 and § 1000.306 provided that any changes proposed by HUD are published and made available for public comment in accordance with applicable law before their implementation.
§ 1000.310
What are the components of the IHBG formula?
The IHBG formula consists of four components:
(a) Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) (§ 1000.316);
(b) Need (§ 1000.324);
(c) 1996 Minimum (§ 1000.340); and
(d) Undisbursed IHBG funds factor (§ 1000.342).
[81 FR 83680, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.312
What is current assisted stock?
Current assisted stock consists of housing units owned or operated pursuant to an ACC. This includes all low rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III housing units under management as of September 30, 1997, as indicated in the Formula Response Form.
§ 1000.314
What is formula current assisted stock?
Formula current assisted stock is current assisted stock as described in § 1000.312 plus 1937 Act units in the development pipeline when they become owned or operated by the recipient and are under management as indicated in the Formula Response Form. Formula current assisted stock also includes Section 8 units when their current contract expires and the Indian tribe continues to manage the assistance in a manner similar to the Section 8 program, as reported on the Formula Response Form.
§ 1000.315
Is a recipient required to report changes to the Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) on the Formula Response Form?
(a) A recipient shall report changes to information related to the IHBG formula on the Formula Response Form, including corrections to the number of Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS), during the time period required by HUD. This time period shall be not less than 60 days from the date of the HUD letter transmitting the form to the recipient.
(b) The Formula Response Form is the only mechanism that a recipient shall use to report changes to the number of FCAS.
[72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007]
§ 1000.316
How is the Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) Component developed?
The Formula Current Assisted Stock component consists of two elements. They are:
(a)
Operating subsidy.
The operating subsidy consists of three variables which are:
(1) The number of low-rent FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy;
(2) The number of Section 8 units whose contract has expired but had been under contract on September 30, 1997, multiplied by the FY 1996 national per unit subsidy; and
(3) The number of Mutual Help and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy.
(b)
Modernization allocation.
(1) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated 250 or more public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per-unit amount of allocation for FY 1996 modernization multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation.
(2) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated fewer than 250 public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the average amount of funds received under the assistance program authorized by section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including funds provided as emergency assistance) for FYs 1992 through 1997.
(c)
Conversion.
Conversion of FCAS units from homeownership (Mutual Help or Turnkey III) to low-rent or from low-rent to a home ownership program.
(1) If units were converted before October 1, 1997, as evidenced by an amended ACC, then those units will be counted for formula funding and eligibility purposes as the type of unit to which they were converted.
(2) If units were converted on or after October 1, 1997, the following applies:
(i)
Funding type.
Units that converted after October 1, 1997 will be funded as the type of unit specified on the original ACC in effect on September 30, 1997.
(ii)
Continued FCAS eligibility.
Whether or not it is the first conversion, a unit converted after October 1, 1997, will be considered as the type converted to when determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to low-rent will be treated as a low-rent unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to homeownership will be treated as a homeownership unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility.
(3) The Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA shall report conversions on the Formula Response Form.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007; 81 FR 83680, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.317
Who is the recipient for funds for current assisted stock which is owned by state-created Regional Native Housing Authorities in Alaska?
If housing units developed under the 1937 Act are owned by a state-created Regional Native Housing Authority in Alaska, and are not located on an Indian reservation, then the recipient for funds allocated for the current assisted stock portion of NAHASDA funds for the units is the regional Indian tribe.
§ 1000.318
When do units under Formula Current Assisted Stock cease to be counted or expire from the inventory used for the formula?
(a) Mutual Help and Turnkey III units shall no longer be considered Formula Current Assisted Stock when the Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA no longer has the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit, whether such right is lost by conveyance, demolition, or otherwise, provided that:
(1) Conveyance of each Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit occurs as soon as practicable after a unit becomes eligible for conveyance by the terms of the MHOA; and
(2) The Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA actively enforce strict compliance by the homebuyer with the terms and conditions of the MHOA, including the requirements for full and timely payment.
(b)(1) A Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit not conveyed after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance by the terms of the MHOA may continue to be considered Formula Current Assisted Stock only if a legal impediment prevented conveyance; the legal impediment continues to exist; the tribe, TDHE, or IHA has taken all other steps necessary for conveyance and all that
remains for conveyance is a resolution of the legal impediment; and the tribe, TDHE, or IHA made the following reasonable efforts to overcome the impediments:
(i) No later than four months after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance, the tribe, TDHE, or IHA creates a written plan of action, which includes a description of specific legal impediments as well as specific, ongoing, and appropriate actions for each applicable unit that have been taken and will be taken to resolve the legal impediments within a 24-month period; and
(ii) The tribe, TDHE, or IHA has carried out or is carrying out the written plan of action; and
(iii) The tribe, TDHE, or IHA has documented undertaking the plan of action.
(2) No Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit will be considered FCAS 24 months after the date the unit became eligible for conveyance, unless the tribe, TDHE, or IHA provides evidence from a third party, such as a court or state or federal government agency, documenting that a legal impediment continues to prevent conveyance. FCAS units that have not been conveyed due to legal impediments on December 22, 2016 shall be treated as having become eligible for conveyance on December 22, 2016.
(c) Rental units shall continue to be included for formula purposes as long as they continue to be operated as low income rental units by the Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA.
(d) Expired contract Section 8 units shall continue as rental units and be included in the formula as long as they are operated as low income rental units as included in the Indian tribe's or TDHE's Formula Response Form.
(e) A unit that is demolished pursuant to a planned demolition may be considered eligible as a FCAS unit if, after demolition is completed, the unit is rebuilt within one year. Demolition is completed when the site of the demolished unit is ready for rebuilding. If the unit cannot be rebuilt within one year because of relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity, the Indian tribe, TDHE or IHA may request approval for a one-time, one-year extension. Requests must be submitted in writing and include a justification for the request.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 81 FR 83680, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.319
What would happen if a recipient misreports or fails to correct Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) information on the Formula Response Form?
(a) A recipient is responsible for verifying and reporting changes to their Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) on the Formula Response Form to ensure that data used for the IHBG Formula are accurate (see § 1000.315). Reporting shall be completed in accordance with requirements in this Subpart D and the Formula Response Form.
(b) If a recipient receives an overpayment of funds because it failed to report such changes on the Formula Response Form in a timely manner, the recipient shall be required to repay the funds within 5 fiscal years. HUD shall subsequently distribute the funds to all Indian tribes in accordance with the next IHBG Formula allocation.
(c) A recipient will not be provided back funding for any units that the recipient failed to report on the Formula Response Form in a timely manner.
(d) HUD shall have 3 years from the date a Formula Response Form is sent out to take action against any recipient that fails to correct or make appropriate changes on that Formula Response Form. Review of FCAS will be accomplished by HUD as a component of A-133 audits, routine monitoring, FCAS target monitoring, or other reviews.
[72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007]
§ 1000.320
How is Formula Current Assisted Stock adjusted for local area costs?
There are two adjustment factors that are used to adjust the allocation of funds for the Current Assisted Stock portion of the formula. They are:
(a) Operating Subsidy as adjusted by the greater of the AEL factor or FMR factor (AELFMR); and
(b) Modernization as adjusted by TDC.
§ 1000.322
Are IHA financed units included in the determination of Formula Current Assisted Stock?
No. If these units are not owned or operated at the time (September 30, 1997) pursuant to an ACC then they are not included in the determination of Formula Current Assisted Stock.
§ 1000.324
How is the need component developed?
After determining the FCAS allocation, remaining funds are allocated by need component. The need component consists of seven criteria. They are:
(a) American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) Households with housing cost burden greater than 50 percent of formula annual income weighted at 22 percent;
(b) AIAN Households which are overcrowded or without kitchen or plumbing weighted at 25 percent;
(c) Housing Shortage which is the number of AIAN households with an annual income less than or equal to 80 percent of formula median income reduced by the combination of current assisted stock and units developed under NAHASDA weighted at 15 percent;
(d) AIAN households with annual income less than or equal to 30 percent of formula median income weighted at 13 percent;
(e) AIAN households with annual income between 30 percent and 50 percent of formula median income weighted at 7 percent;
(f) AIAN households with annual income between 50 percent and 80 percent of formula median income weighted at 7 percent;
(g) AIAN persons weighted at 11 percent.
§ 1000.325
How is the need component adjusted for local area costs?
The need component is adjusted by the TDC.
§ 1000.326
What if a formula area is served by more than one Indian tribe?
(a) If an Indian tribe's formula area overlaps with the formula area of one or more other Indian tribes, the funds allocated to that Indian tribe for the geographic area in which the formula areas overlap will be divided based on:
(1) The Indian tribe's proportional share of the population in the overlapping geographic area; and
(2) The Indian tribe's commitment to serve that proportional share of the population in such geographic area.
(3) In cases where a State recognized tribe's formula area overlaps with the formula area of a Federally recognized Indian tribe, the Federally recognized Indian tribe receives the allocation for the formula area up to its population cap, and the State recognized tribe receives the balance of the overlapping area (if any) up to its population cap.
(b) Tribal membership in the geographic area (not to include dually enrolled tribal members) will be based on data that all Indian tribes involved agree to use. Suggested data sources include tribal enrollment lists, the U.S. Census, Indian Health Service User Data, and Bureau of Indian Affairs data.
(c) Upon receiving a request for expansion or redefinition of a tribe's formula area, if approving the request would create an overlap, HUD shall follow the notice and comment procedures set forth in paragraph (2)(ii) of the definition of “Formula area” in § 1000.302.
(d) If the Indian tribes involved cannot agree on what data source to use, HUD will make the decision on what data will be used to divide the funds between the Indian tribes by August 1.
[63 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007; 81 FR 83681, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.327
What is the order of preference for allocating the IHBG formula needs data for Indian tribes in Alaska not located on reservations due to the unique circumstances in Alaska?
(a) Data in areas without reservations. The data on population and housing within an Alaska Native Village is credited to the Alaska Native Village. Accordingly, the village corporation for the Alaska Native Village has no needs data and no formula allocation. The data on population and
housing outside the Alaska Native Village is credited to the regional Indian tribe, and if there is no regional Indian tribe, the data will be credited to the regional corporation.
(b) Deadline for notification on whether an IHP will be submitted. By September 15 of each year, each Indian tribe in Alaska not located on a reservation, including each Alaska Native village, regional Indian tribe, and regional corporation, or its TDHE must notify HUD in writing whether it or its TDHE intends to submit an IHP. If an Alaska Native village notifies HUD that it does not intend either to submit an IHP or to designate a TDHE to do so, or if HUD receives no response from the Alaska Native village or its TDHE, the formula data which would have been credited to the Alaska Native village will be credited to the regional Indian tribe, or if there is no regional Indian tribe, to the regional corporation.
§ 1000.328
What is the minimum amount that an Indian tribe may receive under the need component of the formula?
(a) Subject to the eligibility criteria described in paragraph (b) of this section, the minimum allocation in any fiscal year to an Indian tribe under the need component of the IHBG Formula shall equal 0.007826 percent of the available appropriations for that fiscal year after set asides.
(b) To be eligible for the minimum allocation described in paragraph (a) of this section, an Indian tribe must:
(1) Receive less than $200,000 under the FCAS component of the IHBG Formula for the fiscal year; and
(2) Certify in its Indian Housing Plan the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income.
[72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 71527, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.329
What is the minimum total grant allocated to a tribe if there is carryover funds available?
(a) If in any given year there are carryover funds, then HUD will hold the lesser amount of $3 million or available carryover funds for additional allocations to tribes with grant allocations of less than 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations. All tribes eligible under this section shall receive a grant allocation equal to 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations.
(b)(1) If the set-aside carryover funds are insufficient to fund all eligible tribes at 0.011547 percent of that year's appropriations, the minimum total grant shall be reduced to an amount which can be fully funded with the available set-aside carryover funds.
(2) If less than $3 million is necessary to fully fund tribes under paragraph (a) of this section, any remaining carryover amounts of the set aside shall be carried forward to the next year's formula.
(c) To be eligible, an Indian tribe must certify in its Indian Housing Plan the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income.
(d) For purposes of this section, carryover funds means grant funds voluntarily returned to the formula or not accepted by tribes in a fiscal year.
[81 FR 83681, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.330
What are the data sources for the need variables?
(a) The sources of data for the need variables shall be data that are available and collected in a uniform manner that can be confirmed and verified for all AIAN households and persons living in an identified area. Until fiscal year 2018, the data used are 2000 U.S. Decennial Census data and any HUD-accepted Census challenges. The 2000 U.S. Decennial Census data shall be adjusted annually using IHS projections based upon birth and death rate data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics.
(b)(1) Beginning fiscal year 2018, the data source used to determine the AIAN persons variable described in § 1000.324(g) shall be the most recent U.S. Decennial Census data adjusted for any statistically significant undercount for AIAN population confirmed by the U.S. Census Bureau and updated annually using the U.S. Census Bureau county level Population Estimates for Native Americans. For Remote Alaska as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, Alaska Formula Areas in Remote Alaska shall be treated as Reservation and Trust Lands, unless the U.S. Census Bureau includes Remote Alaska in their Census Coverage
Measurement or comparable study. The data under this paragraph (b) shall be updated annually using the U.S. Census Bureau county level Population Estimates for Native Americans.
(2) Beginning fiscal year 2018, the data source used to determine the variables described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of § 1000.324 shall initially be the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates.
(c) Indian tribes may challenge the data described in this section pursuant to § 1000.336.
[81 FR 83681, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.331
How will the impacts from adoption of a new data source be minimized as the new data source is implemented?
(a) To minimize the impact of funding changes based on the introduction of a new data source under § 1000.330, in fiscal year 2018 and each year thereafter, if, solely as a direct result of the introduction of a new data source, an Indian tribe's allocation under the need component of the formula is less than 90 percent of the amount it received under the need component in the immediate previous fiscal year, the Indian tribe's need allocation shall be adjusted up to an amount equal to 90 percent of the previous year's need allocation.
(b) Nothing in this section shall impact other adjustments under this part, including minimum funding, census challenges, formula area changes, or an increase in the total amount of funds available under the need component.
(c) In the event of a decrease in the total amount of funds available under the need component, an Indian tribe's adjusted allocation under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the reduced amount available for distribution under the need component of the formula.
(d) Adjustments under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made to a tribe's need allocation after adjusting that allocation under paragraph (a) of this section.
[81 FR 83681, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.332
Will data used by HUD to determine an Indian tribe's or TDHE's formula allocation be provided to the Indian tribe or TDHE before the allocation?
Yes. HUD shall provide the Indian tribe or TDHE notice of the data to be used for the formula and projected allocation amount by June 1.
[77 FR 71528, Dec. 3, 2012]
§ 1000.334
May Indian tribes, TDHEs, or HUD challenge the data from the U.S. Decennial Census or provide an alternative source of data?
Yes. Provided that the data are gathered, evaluated, and presented in a manner acceptable to HUD and that the standards for acceptability are consistently applied throughout the Country.
§ 1000.336
How may an Indian tribe, TDHE, or HUD challenge data or appeal HUD formula determinations?
(a) An Indian tribe, TDHE, or HUD may challenge data used in the IHBG Formula and HUD formula determinations regarding:
(1) U.S. Census data;
(2) Tribal enrollment;
(3) Formula area;
(4) Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS);
(5) Total Development Cost (TDC);
(6) Fair Market Rents (FMRs);
(7) Indian Health Service projections based upon birth and death rate data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics; and
(8) The undisbursed funds factor.
(b) An Indian tribe or TDHE may not challenge data or HUD formula determinations regarding Allowable Expense Level (AEL) and the inflation factor.
(c) The challenge and the collection of data and the appeal of HUD formula determinations is an allowable cost for IHBG funds.
(d) An Indian tribe or TDHE that seeks to appeal data or a HUD formula determination, and has data in its possession that are acceptable to HUD, shall submit the challenge or appeal in writing with data and proper documentation to HUD. An Indian tribe or TDHE may appeal the undisbursed
funds factor no later than 30 days after the receipt of the formula determination. Data used to challenge data contained in the U.S. Census must meet the requirements described in § 1000.330(a). Further, in order for a census challenge to be considered for the upcoming fiscal year allocation, documentation must be submitted by March 30th.
(e) HUD shall respond to all challenges or appeals no later than 45 days after receipt and either approve or deny the appeal in writing, setting forth the reasons for its decision.
(1) If HUD challenges the validity of the submitted data HUD and the Indian tribe or TDHE shall attempt in good faith to resolve any discrepancies so that such data may be included in the formula allocation.
(2) If HUD denies a challenge or appeal, the Indian tribe or TDHE may request reconsideration of HUD's denial within 30 calendar days of receipt of HUD's denial. The request shall be in writing and set forth justification for reconsideration.
(3) HUD shall in writing affirm or deny the Indian tribe's or TDHE's request for reconsideration, setting forth HUD's reasons for the decision, within 20 calendar days of receiving the request. HUD's denial of a request for reconsideration shall constitute final agency action.
(4) If HUD approves the Indian tribe or TDHE's appeal, HUD will adjust to the Indian tribe's or TDHE's subsequent fiscal year allocation to include only the disputed fiscal year(s).
(f) In the event HUD questions whether the data contained in the formula accurately represents the Indian tribe's need, HUD shall request the Indian tribe to submit supporting documentation to justify the data and, if applicable, to provide a commitment to serve the population indicated in the geographic area.
[72 FR 20025, Apr. 20, 2007, as amended at 81 FR 83681, Nov. 22, 2016]
§ 1000.340
What if an Indian tribe is allocated less funding under the IHBG Formula than it received in Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization?
(a) If an Indian tribe is allocated less funding under the modernization allocation of the formula pursuant to § 1000.316(b)(2) than the calculation of the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per-unit amount of allocation for FY 1996 modernization multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation, the Indian tribe's modernization allocation is calculated under § 1000.316(b)(1). The remaining grants are adjusted to keep the allocation within available appropriations.
(b) If an Indian tribe is allocated less funding under the formula than an IHA received on its behalf in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization, its grant is increased to the amount received in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization. The remaining grants are adjusted to keep the allocation within available appropriations.
[72 FR 20026, Apr. 20, 2007]
§ 1000.342
Are undisbursed IHBG funds a factor in the grant formula?
Yes, beginning fiscal year 2018. After calculating the initial allocation calculation for the current fiscal year by calculating FCAS, need, the 1996 Minimum, and repayments or additions for past over- or under-funding for each Indian tribe, the undisbursed funds factor shall be applied as follows:
(a) The undisbursed funds factor applies if an Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more and the Indian tribe has undisbursed IHBG funds in an amount that is greater than the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations.
(b) If subject to paragraph (a) of this section, the Indian tribe's grant allocation shall be the greater of the initial allocation calculation minus the amount of undisbursed IHBG funds that exceed the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations, or its 1996 Minimum.
(c) For purposes of this section, “undisbursed IHBG funds” means the amount of IHBG funds allocated to an Indian tribe in HUD's line of credit
control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made. For Indian tribes under an umbrella TDHE (a recipient that has been designated to receive grant amounts by more than one Indian tribe), if the Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more, its undisbursed IHBG funds is the amount calculated by multiplying the umbrella TDHE's total balance in HUD's line of credit control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made by a percentage based on the Indian tribe's proportional share of the initial allocation calculation of all tribes under the umbrella.
(d) Amounts subtracted from an initial allocation calculation under this section shall be redistributed under the need component among all Indian tribes not subject to paragraph (a) of this section (while also retaining the 1996 Minimum).

(c) HUD is responsible for reviewing the recipient as set forth in § 1000.520.
(d) HUD monitoring will consist of on-site as well as off-site review of records, reports and audits. To the extent funding is available, HUD or its designee will provide technical assistance and training, or funds to the recipient to obtain technical assistance and training. In the absence of funds, HUD shall make best efforts to provide technical assistance and training.
§ 1000.503
What is an appropriate extent of HUD monitoring?
(a) Subject to any conflicting or supplementary requirement of specific legislation, and upon the effective date of this regulation, the frequency of HUD monitoring of a particular recipient will be determined by application of the HUD standard risk assessment factors, provided that when a recipient requests to be monitored, HUD shall conduct such monitoring as soon as practicable. The HUD standard risk assessment factors may be but are not limited to the following:
(1) Annual grant amount;
(2) Disbursed amounts—all open grants;
(3) Months since last on-site monitoring;
(4) Delinquent audits under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F;
(5) Open 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, or Inspector General audit findings;

(b) If monitoring indicates noncompliance, HUD may undertake additional sampling and review to determine the extent of such noncompliance. The level of HUD monitoring of a recipient once that recipient has been selected for HUD monitoring is as follows:
(1) Review recipient program compliance for the current program year and the 2 prior program years;
(2) On-site inspection of no more than 10 dwelling units or no more than 10 percent of total dwelling units, whichever is greater;
(3) Review of no more than 10 client files or no more than 10 percent of client files, whichever is greater.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, HUD may at any time undertake additional sampling and review of prior program years, subject to the records retention limitations of § 1000.552, if HUD has credible information suggesting noncompliance. HUD will share this information with the recipient as appropriate.
(d) A recipient may request ONAP to enter into Self-Monitoring Mutual Agreements or other self-monitoring arrangements with recipients. ONAP will monitor the recipient only in accordance with such agreement or arrangement, unless ONAP finds reasonable evidence of fraud, a pattern of noncompliance, or the significant unlawful expenditure of IHBG funds.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if HUD makes a determination that the failure of a recipient to comply substantially with any material provision of NAHASDA or these regulations is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of funds provided under NAHASDA in a manner that is not authorized by law, HUD may, in accordance with section 401(a)(4) of NAHASDA, take action under paragraph (a)(3) of this section prior to conducting a hearing under paragraph (b) of this section. HUD shall provide notice to the recipient at the time that HUD takes that action and conducts a hearing, in accordance with section 401(a)(4)(B) of NAHASDA, within 60 days of such notice.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if HUD determines that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient, if the recipient requests, HUD shall provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability or capacity of the recipient to administer assistance under NAHASDA in compliance with the requirements under NAHASDA. A recipient's eligibility for technical assistance under this subsection is contingent on the recipient's execution of, and compliance with, a performance agreement pursuant to Section 401(b) of NAHASDA.
(e) In lieu of, or in addition to, any action described in this section, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations, HUD may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, with a recommendation that appropriate civil action be instituted.

(a) The noncompliance has a material effect on the recipient meeting its planned activities as described in its Indian Housing Plan;
(b) The noncompliance represents a material pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance with a particular provision of NAHASDA or the regulations, even if a single instance of noncompliance would not be substantial;
(c) The noncompliance involves the obligation or expenditure of a material amount of the NAHASDA funds budgeted by the recipient for a material activity; or
(d) The noncompliance places the housing program at substantial risk of fraud, waste or abuse.

For a recipient not covered by the Single Audit Act, but which chooses to obtain a periodic financial review, the cost of such a review would be an eligible program expense.
§ 1000.548
Must a copy of the recipient's audit pursuant to the Single Audit Act relating to NAHASDA activities be submitted to HUD?
No. A copy of the recipient audit under the Single Audit Act relating to NAHASDA activities is only required to be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
[80 FR 75944, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 1000.550
If the TDHE is the recipient, does it have to submit a copy of its audit to the Indian tribe?
Yes. The Indian tribe as the grant beneficiary must receive a copy of the audit report so that it can fully carry out its oversight responsibilities with NAHASDA.
§ 1000.552
How long must the recipient maintain program records?
(a) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, and statistical records of the recipient which are required to be maintained by the statute, regulation, or grant agreement.
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, records must be retained for 3 years from the end of the tribal program year during which the funds were expended.
(c) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.

# Appendix A to Part 1000—Indian Housing Block Grant Formula Mechanics
This appendix shows the different components of the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) formula. The following text explains how each component of the IHBG formula is calculated.
1. The first step in running the IHBG formula is to determine the amount available for allocation in the Fiscal Year (FY). It is the sum of:
(a) The FY appropriation for the IHBG program less amounts in the Appropriations Act mandated for purposes other than the formula allocation.
(b) The net amount, if any, made available as a result of corrections for over- or under-allocations in prior FYs.
(c) The amount, if any, made available pursuant to § 1000.536.
(d) The amounts, if any, made available because tribes voluntarily returned, or did not accept, the amounts allocated to them in prior FYs, defined as “carryover” (see § 1000.329).
2. If there is carryover as defined in § 1000.329, the amount of carryover up to $3 million, is then held aside for allocation under the minimum total grant provisions of the formula (see 11 below).
3. The IHBG formula first calculates the amount each tribe is allocated under the Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) component (See §§ 1000.310 through 1000.322). The FCAS component is comprised of two parts, Operating Subsidy (§ 1000.316(a)) and Modernization (§ 1000.316(b)).
(a) The Operating Subsidy component is calculated in two steps, as follows:
(i) Each tribe's counts of Low Rent, Homeownership (Mutual Help and Turnkey III), and Section 8 units are multiplied by the National Per Unit Subsidy for operations for that category of unit, which is a 1996 index for the type of unit that is adjusted for inflation (see § 1000.302 defining National Per Unit Subsidy). The amounts are summed to create an initial calculation of the operating subsidy component.
(ii) The initial operating subsidy component amount is then adjusted for local area costs, using an adjustment factor called the AELFMR. The AELFMR factor is calculated for each tribe in three steps. First, an Allowable Expense Level (AEL) factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's AEL, a historic per-unit measure of operating cost, by the national weighted average AEL (see § 1000.302 defining Allowable Expense Level). Second, a Fair Market Rent (FMR) factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's FMR amount, an area-specific index published annually by HUD (see § 1000.302 Fair Market Rent factor), by the national weighted average FMR. Third, an AELFMR factor is created by assigning each tribe the greater of its AEL or FMR factor, and dividing that figure by the national weighted average AELFMR. In all cases, when the national average figure is calculated, tribes are weighted by the amount of their initial operating subsidy as calculated in 3(a)(i).
(See § 1000.320).
(b) The Modernization component is determined using two methods depending on the number of public housing units that a tribe's housing authority operated prior to the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act.
(i) For all tribes, the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III units are multiplied by the National Per Unit Subsidy for modernization from 1996 adjusted for inflation (see § 1000.302 defining National Per Unit Subsidy).
(ii) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority (IHA) that owned or operated fewer than 250 units on October 1, 1997, an alternative modernization component is calculated from the amount of funds the IHA received under the assistance program authorized by Section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including funds provided as emergency assistance) for FYs 1992 through 1997 (see § 1000.316(b)(2)). If this alternative calculation is greater than the amount calculated in paragraph (a) above, it is used to calculate the tribe's modernization component.
(iii) The Modernization component is then multiplied by a local area cost adjustment factor based on the Total Development Cost (TDC) for the tribe (see § 1000.302) divided by
the national weighted average of all TDCs weighted by each tribe's pre-adjustment Modernization calculation in paragraph (b)(i) or (ii) above as applicable.
4. The total amounts calculated under the FCAS component for each tribe are then added together to determine the national total amount allocated under the FCAS component. That total is subtracted from the funds available for allocation less the carryover amount held aside for allocation under the minimum total grant provision in § 1000.329. The remainder is the total amount available for allocation under the need component of the IHBG formula.
5. The first step in calculating need component is identifying weighted needs variables and adjusting for local area cost differences.
(a) Need is first calculated using seven factors, where each factor is a tribe's share of the national totals for each of seven variables. The data used for the seven variables is described in § 1000.330. The person count variable is adjusted for statistically significant undercounts for reservations, trust lands and remote Alaska and for growth in population since the latest Decennial Census. The Population Cap provision in § 1000.302 Formula Area (5) is then applied. Needs data are capped if the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population counts exceed twice tribal enrollment unless a tribe can demonstrate that it serves more than twice as many non-tribal members as tribal members, in which case the cap is adjusted upward.
The factors are weighted as set forth in § 1000.324, as follows:
(i) 22 percent of the amount available for allocation under the needs component are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households paying more than 50 percent of their income for housing and living in each tribe's Formula Area (see § 1000.302);
(ii) 25 percent are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households living in overcrowded housing and/or without kitchen or plumbing in each tribe's Formula Area;
(iii) 15 percent are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households with an annual income less than or equal to 80 percent of Formula Median Income (see § 1000.302) living in each tribe's Formula Area less the tribe's number of FCAS.
(iv) 13 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income less than or equal to 30 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;
(v) 7 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income between 30 percent and 50 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;
(vi) 7 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income between 50 percent and 80 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;
(vii) 11 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN persons living in each tribe's Formula Area.
(b) The result of these calculations for each tribe is then multiplied by a local area cost adjustment based on the Total Development Cost for the tribe (see § 1000.302) divided by the national weighted average of TDCs weighted by each tribe's pre-adjustment need calculation. (See § 1000.325).
6. Each tribe's initial need allocation amount is then adjusted under the minimum need allocation provision of § 1000.328. Tribes that are allocated less than $200,000 under the FCAS component of the IHBG formula and that certify the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income in their Indian Housing Plans will be allocated no less than a specified minimum under the needs component of the formula. The specified minimum amount shall equal 0.007826 percent of the appropriation for that FY after set-asides. The increase in funding for the tribes allocated the minimum need amount is funded by a reallocation from other tribes whose needs allocation exceeds the minimum need amount. This is necessary in order to keep the total allocation within the appropriation level (See § 1000.328).
7. Whenever a new Data Source is first introduced, provision is made to moderate extreme impacts through phase down adjustments. For purposes of these adjustments, new data sources (see § 1000.331) include the initial introduction of the American Community Survey and 2010 Decennial Census in 2018, and the initial introduction of the 2020 Decennial Census when it becomes available. Tribes whose allocation under the need component decrease by more than ten percent in the first year of introduction will have that decrease moderated by subsequent adjustments, as required to prevent a drop of more than ten percent per year in the tribes' needs allocation attributable solely to the introduction of the New Data Source. After allocation adjustments are made under § 1000.331 for a FY, the needs allocation of an Indian tribe whose needs allocation increased as a result of the introduction of a New Data Source under § 1000.331 shall be adjusted downward proportionate to its share of the total increase in funding resulting from the introduction of a New Data Source to keep the overall needs allocation within available appropriations.
8. A tribe's preliminary total allocation for a grant is calculated by summing the amounts calculated under the FCAS and need components. This amount is compared to how much a tribe received in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization under the 1937 Housing Act. If a tribe received more
in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization than it does under the IHBG formula allocation, its preliminary total allocation is adjusted up to the FY 1996 amount (See § 1000.340(b)). Indian tribes receiving more under the IHBG formula than in FY 1996 have their grant allocations adjusted downward to offset the upward adjustments for the other tribes.
9. The initial allocation amount for the current FY is calculated by adding any adjustments for over- or under-funding occurring in prior FYs to the allocation calculated in the previous step. These adjustments typically result from late reporting of FCAS changes, or conveyances which occur in a timely manner following the removal of units from eligibility due to conveyance eligibility.
10. The Undisbursed Funds Factor component is calculated based on the initial allocation amounts calculated above. Tribes with an initial allocation of $5 million or more and undisbursed IHBG grant amounts (the amount available to the tribe in HUD's line of credit control on October 1 of the FY for which the allocation is being made) in an amount greater than the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations will have their initial allocation amount adjusted down by the difference between the tribe's undisbursed grant amounts and the sum of its prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations. If this adjustment would bring the tribe below its FY 1996 minimum (see § 1000.340(b)), then the tribe will be allocated its FY 1996 minimum. The sum of the adjustments will be reallocated among the other tribes proportionally under the need component.
11. A final adjustment is made under § 1000.329 which allocates available carryover amounts up to $3 million to achieve minimum total allocations. Tribes that certify in their Indian Housing Plans the presence of any eligible households at or below 80 percent of median income and whose current FY formula allocation after the Undisbursed Funds Factor adjustment determined in the preceding step is less than 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, will have their allocation adjusted upwards to 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, or to a lesser percentage which can be achieved for all eligible tribes with available carryover held for this adjustment (see 2 above).

# Appendix B to Part 1000—IHBG Block Grant Formula Mechanisms
1. The first step in running the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) formula is to determine the total amount available for allocation in the current Fiscal Year (FY).
ALLOCAMT = APPROP + ADJ1 + ADJ2 + CARRYOVER.
Where:
ALLOCAMT = amount available for allocation under the formula.
APPROP = current FY appropriation for the IHBG program less amounts in the Appropriations Act mandated for purposes other than the formula allocation.
ADJ1= net amount, if any, made available as a result of corrections for over-or under allocations in prior FYs.
ADJ2 = amount, if any, made available under § 1000.536.
CARRYOVER = amounts, if any, made available because tribes voluntarily returned, or did not accept, the amounts allocated to them in prior FYs.
2. If there is carryover as defined in § 1000.329, the amount of carryover up to $3 million, is then held aside for allocation under the minimum total grant provisions of the formula (see Step 10), then:
MGHOLD = amount set-aside for allocation under minimum total grant provision.
If CARRYOVER = 0, MGHOLD = 0.
If CARRYOVER
0 and CARRYOVER
= $3 million, MGHOLD = CARRYOVER.
If CARRYOVER
$3 million, MGHOLD = $3 million.
3. The FCAS component is calculated first. FCAS consists of two parts, Operating Subsidy (OPSUB) and Modernization (MOD), such that:
FCAS = OPSUB + MOD.
a. OPSUB is calculated in two steps, as follows:
(i) First, the number of Low-Rent, Section 8 and homeownership units are multiplied by the applicable national per unit subsidy (§ 1000.302 National Per Unit Subsidy). The amounts are summed to create an initial calculation of the Operating Subsidy component.
OPSUB1 = [LR * LRSUB] + [(MH + TK) * HOSUB] + [S8 * S8SUB].
Where:
OPSUB1 = initial calculation of Operating Subsidy component.
LR = number of Low-Rent units.
LRSUB = national per unit subsidy for Low-Rent units ($2,440 * INF).
INF = adjustment for inflation since 1995, as determined by the Consumer Price Index for housing.
MH + TK = number of Mutual Help and Turnkey III units.
HOSUB = national per unit subsidy for Homeownership units ($528 * INF).
S8 = number of Section 8 units.
S8SUB = national per unit subsidy for Section 8 units = ($3,625 * INF).
(ii) The initial Operating Subsidy component amount is then adjusted for local area
costs, using an adjustment factor called the AELFMR. The AELFMR factor is calculated for each tribe in three steps. First, an AEL factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's Allowable Expense Level (AEL), a historic per-unit measure of operating cost, by the national weighted average AEL (see § 1000.302 defining Allowable Expense Level)
AEL FACTOR = AEL/NAEL.
Where:
AEL = local Allowable Expense Level.
NAEL = national weighted average for AEL, where the weight is a tribe's initial calculation of operating subsidy.
Second, an FMR factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's Fair Market Rent amount (FMR), an area-specific index published annually by HUD (see § 1000.302 Fair Market Rent factor), by the national weighted average FMR.
FMR FACTOR = FMR/NFMR.
Where:
FMR= local Fair Market Rent.
NFMR = national weighted average for FMR, where the weight is a tribe's initial calculation of operating subsidy.
Third, an AELFMR factor is created by assigning each tribe the greater of its AEL or FMR factor, and dividing that figure by the national weighted average AELFMR. In all cases, when the national average figure is calculated, tribes are weighted by the amount of their initial operating subsidy as calculated in 3(a)(i) above. (See § 1000.320).
AELFMRFACTOR = final local area cost adjustment factor (AELFACTOR or FMRFACTOR)/NAELFMR.
Where:
NAELFMR = national weighted average for greater of AEL Factor or FMR factor, where weight is a tribe's initial calculation of operating subsidy
Finally, the AELFMR factor is used to adjust the initial operating subsidy calculation for differences in local area costs.
OPSUB = OPSUB1 * AELFMRFACTOR.
Where:
OPSUB = Operating Subsidy component after adjustment for local cost differences.
b. The modernization component, MOD, is calculated by two different methods, depending on whether the tribe had an Indian housing authority (IHA) that owned or operated more than 250 public housing units on October 1, 1997.
(i) MOD1 is calculated for all tribes and considers the number of Low-Rent, and Mutual Help and Turnkey III FCAS units. Each of these is adjusted by the national per-unit modernization subsidy
MOD1 = [LR + MH + TK] * MODPU.
Where:
LR = number of Low-Rent units.
MH = number of Mutual Help units.
TK = number of Turnkey III units.
MODPU = national per-unit amount for modernization in 1996 adjusted for inflation ($1,974 * INF).
INF = adjustment for inflation since 1995, as determined by the Consumer Price Index for housing.
(ii) MODAVG is calculated only for tribes that had an IHA that owned or operated fewer than 250 public housing units on October 1, 1997, as the annual average amount they received for FYs 1992 through 1997 under the assistance program authorized by section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including emergency assistance). If this alternative calculation is greater than the amount calculated in (i), it is used to calculate the tribe's modernization component.
MODAVG = Average (FY 1992 to FY 1997) amount received by Section 14 of the 1937 Act.
If MODAVG
MOD1, MOD1 = MODAVG.
c. The modernization calculation is adjusted for local area costs:
MOD = MOD1 * (TDC/NTDC).
Where:
TDC = Local Total Development Costs defined in § 1000.302.
NTDC = weighted national average for TDC, where the weight is the initial calculation of modernization amount of tribe with CAS.
4. Now that calculation for FCAS is complete, the amount allocated using the need component of the formula can be determined:
NEEDALLOCAMT = ALLOCAMT − MGHOLD − NATCAS.
Where:
NEEDALLOCAMT = amount allocated using the need component of the formula.
ALLOCAMT = amount available for allocation under the formula.
MGHOLD = amount held for allocation under minimum total grant provision.
NATCAS = national summation of FCAS allocation for all tribes.
5. The first step in calculating needs is identifying weighted needs variables and adjusting for local area cost differences.
a. The basic needs calculation uses seven weighted criteria based on population and housing data in a tribe's Formula Area or share of Formula Area if Formula Areas overlap (see § 1000.302 Formula Area and § 1000.326) to allocate the funds available for the needs component. The person count variable is adjusted for statistically significant undercounts for reservations, trust lands and remote Alaska and for changes in population since the latest Decennial Census.
PERADJ = PER * UCFACTOR * POPCHGFACTOR.
Where:
PER = American Indian and Alaskan Native (AIAN) persons as reported in the most recent Decennial Census.
UCFACTOR= 1+ the percentage undercount identified by the Census by type of land (in 2010 1.0488 for reservation and trust lands only and assumed also to apply to remote Alaska).
POPCHGFACTOR = the ratio of the most recent AIAN Census population estimate for county to the AIAN count for county from the Decennial Census.
The Population Cap provision in § 1000.302 Formula Area (5) is then applied. Needs data are capped if AIAN population counts exceed twice tribal enrollment unless a tribe can demonstrate that it serves more than twice as many non-tribal members as tribal members, in which case the cap is adjusted upward.
POPCAPTEST=1 if PERADJ
TEmultiplier * TE
If POPCAPTEST=1, (tribes subject to Population Cap) then:
PER = TEmultiplier * TE
POPCAPADJF = PER/PERADJ
For tribes NOT subject to Population Cap,
PER = PERADJ and POPCAPADJF = 1.
Where:
POPCAPTEST = an indicator showing whether a tribe's needs data must be adjusted downward because its Formula Area population is disproportionally large relative to tribe's enrollment,
TEmultiplier = 2, or a larger factor if justified by tribe on annual basis.
TE = Tribal enrollment.
POPCAPADJF = factor used to adjust household needs variables.
An initial calculation of the needs component is then calculated by determining each tribe's share of national totals on each variable, and applying weights to the variables as specified in regulation.
BASENEED = [(0.11 * (PER)/NPER) + (0.13 * HHLE30/NHHLE30) + (0.07 * HH30T50/NHH30T50) + (0.07 * HH50T80/NHH50T80) + (0.25 * OCRPR/NOCRPR) + (0.22 * SCBTOT/NSCBTOT) + (0.15 * HOUSHOR/NHOUSHOR)] * NEEDALLOCAMT.
Where:
PER = count of AIAN persons after adjustments.
NPER = national total of PER.
HHLE30 = count of AIAN households less than 30% of formula median income multiplied by POPCAPADJF.
NHHLE30 = national total of HHLE30.
HH30T50 = count of AIAN households 30% to 50% of formula median income multiplied by POPCAPADJF.
NHH30T50 = national total of HH30T50.
HH50T80 = count of AIAN households 50% to 80% of formula median income multiplied by POPCAPADJF.
NHH50T80 = national total of HH50T80.
OCRPR = count of AIAN households crowded or without complete kitchen or plumbing multiplied by POPCAPADJF.
NOCRPR = national total of OCRPR.
SCBTOT = count of AIAN households paying more than 50% of their income for housing multiplied by POPCAPADJF.
NSCBTOT = national total SCBTOT.
HOUSHOR = a measure of housing shortage calculated as (HHLE30 + HH30T50 + HH50T80)—(LR + MH + TKIII)
NHOUSHOR = national total of HOUSHOR.
NEEDALLOCAMT = amount allocated using the need component of the formula.
b. The basic needs calculation is adjusted to reflect differences in local area costs.
NEED = BASENEED * (TDC/NATDC).
Where:
TDC = Local Total Development Costs defined in § 1000.302.
NATDC = average for TDC for all tribes weighted using BASENEED.
6. The need allocation computed above is adjusted to take into account the minimum needs provision. Tribes allocated less than $200,000 under the FCAS component of the IHBG formula and that certify the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income in their Indian Housing Plan are allocated an additional amount so their needs allocation equals 0.007826 percent of the available appropriations for that FY after set-asides.
MINNEED = APPROP * 0.00007826.
Where:
APPROP = current FY appropriation for the IHBG program less amounts in the Appropriations Act mandated for purposes other than the formula allocation.
If in the first need computation, a qualified tribe is allocated less than the minimum needs funding level, its need allocation will go up. Other tribes whose needs allocations are greater than the minimum needs amount will have their allocations adjusted downward to keep the total allocation within available funds:
If NEED
MINNEED and FCAS
$200,000 and income-based need has been identified in a tribe's IHP, then NEED1 = MINNEED.
If NEED
= MINNEED, then NEED1 = NEED1 − {UNDERMIN$ * [(NEED1 − MINNEED)/OVERMIN$]}.
Where:
MINNEED = minimum needs amount.
UNDERMIN$ = for all tribes qualifying for an increase under the minimum needs
provision, sum of the differences between MINNEED and NEED1.
OVERMIN$ = for all tribes with needs allocations larger than the minimum needs amount, the sum of the difference between NEED1 and MINNEED.
7. Whenever a new data source (see § 1000.331) is first introduced, provision is made to moderate extreme impacts through phase down adjustments. Tribes whose allocation under the need component decrease by more than ten percent in the first year of introduction will have that decrease moderated by subsequent adjustments, as required to prevent a drop of more than ten percent per year in the tribes' needs allocation attributable solely to the introduction of the new data source. A phase down adjustment schedule is calculated, containing adjustment amounts (PDADJ
n
) for the first and all subsequent FYs, based on the amount allocated to a tribe under the need component in the FY prior to the introduction of the new data source using the old data source. That is,
If NEED1NewDS
0.9 * NEED1OldDS, then a tribe qualifies for a phase down adjustment (PDADJ) (see § 1000.331(c)).
PDADJ
n
= (((0.9
n
)
* NEED1OldDS)—NEED1NewDS), where n = 1 to ∞ provided PDADJ
n
0 for at least one tribe.
Where:
NEED1NewDS = the amount the tribe would have received in the FY prior to the introduction of the new data source had the new data source been used to determine their need component in that FY.
NEED1OldDS = the amount a tribe actually received in the FY prior to the introduction of the new data source based on the old data source.
PDADJ
n
= the size of the adjustment that qualifying tribes will receive in each year n, where the n represents the number of years elapsed since the introduction of the new data source and is equal to one in the first year.
After allocation adjustments are made under § 1000.331 for a FY, the needs allocation of an Indian tribe whose needs allocation increased as a result of the introduction of a new data source shall be adjusted downward proportionate to its share of the total increase in funding resulting from the introduction of a new data source to keep the overall need component within available appropriations. For each tribe which benefitted from the introduction of the new data source, their share of the total gain is calculated and that share is used to determine the amount of contribution they will make in each year following the introduction of the new data source to allow the phase down adjustments to be made without exceeding the amount available for allocation.
If NEED1NewDS
NEED1OldDS, then tribe gained from the introduction of the new data source and contributes a portion of their gain to offset the phase down adjustments.
GAINSHR = (NEED1NewDS -NEED1OldDS)/TOTGAINYR1.
CONTRIB
n
= GAINSHR * TOTPDADJ
n,
Where:
NEEDd1NewDS = the amount the tribe would have received in the FY prior to the of introduction of the new data source had the new data source been used to determine their needs funding in that FY.
NEED1OldDS = the amount a tribe actually received in the FY prior to the introduction the new data source based on the old data source.
GAINSHR = a tribe's share of the total gains realized by all tribes that benefitted from the introduction of the new data source.
TOTGAINYR1 = the sum of the amounts that tribes gain from the introduction of the new data source in year one.
CONTRIB
n
= the size of the contribution that non-qualifying tribes give in each year n, where the n represents the number of years elapsed since the introduction of the new data source and equal to one in the first year.
TOTPDADJ
n
= the total amount in each year n required to cover the cost of phase down adjustments in that year,
i.e.
S
PDADJ
n.
The initial needs allocation for each tribe is adjusted based on the phase down adjustments and contribution amounts in the phase down schedule.
NEED1PD = NEED1 +__PDADJ
n
− CONTRIB
n
.
Where:
NEED1PD = a tribe's allocation under the need component after applying the phase down adjustment schedule.
NEED1= the initial calculation of need in the current FY from step 6 above.
PDADJ
n
= the size of the adjustment that qualifying tribes will receive in each year n, where the n represents the number of years elapsed since the introduction of the new data source and is equal to one in the first year.
CONTRIB
n
= the size of the contribution that non-qualifying tribes give in each year n, where the n represents the number of years elapsed since the introduction of the new data source and equal to one in the first year.
PDADJ
n
and CONTRIB
n
as calculated in the initial phase down adjustment schedule may have to be adjusted downward in subsequent FYs if the total amount available for allocation under the needs Component (
i.e.
NEEDALLOCAMT in Step 4) is lower than
the amount available for that purpose in the FY prior to the introduction of the new data source. If so, both PDADJ
n
and CONTRIB
n
will be reduced by a factor which is the ratio of NEEDALLOCAMT in current FY to NEEDALLOCAMT in the year prior to the introduction of the new data source.
Furthermore, when the 2020 Decennial Census or other new data source is introduced, a new phase down adjustment schedule will be calculated in a similar manner as that was calculated for FY 2018.
8. A tribe's preliminary total allocation is calculated by summing the amounts calculated under the FCAS and need components that will serve as the basis for further adjustments in accordance with § 1000.340.
GRANT1 = FCAS + NEED1PD.
Where:
GRANT1 = preliminary total allocation before applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8), Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
FCAS = Formula Current Assisted Stock component equal to OPSUB + MOD.
NEED1PD = the Tribe's needs allocation after applying the phase down adjustment schedule.
GRANT1 is compared to how much a tribe received in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization under the 1937 Housing Act. If a tribe received more in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization than its IHBG formula allocation, its preliminary total allocation is adjusted up to the FY 1996 amount (See § 1000.340(b)). Indian tribes receiving more under the IHBG formula than in FY 1996 have their grant allocations adjusted downward to offset the upward adjustment for the other tribes.
TEST = GRANT1 − OPMOD96.
If TEST is
= than 0, then GRANT2 = OPMOD96.
If TEST is greater than 0 and GRANT1
MINNEED, then:
GRANT2 = GRANT1 − [UNDER1996 * (TEST/OVER1996)].
Where:
TEST = variable to decide whether tribes qualify for adjustments under 1996 minimum funding.
GRANT1 = preliminary total allocation before applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8), Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
OPMOD96 = funding received by tribe in FY 1996 for Operating Subsidy and Modernization.
MINNEED = minimum needs amount.
UNDER1996 = for all tribes with TEST less than 0, sum of the absolute value of TEST.
OVER1996 = for all tribes with TEST greater than 0, sum of TEST.
GRANT2 = preliminary total allocation after applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8) but before applying the Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
9. The initial allocation amount for the current FY is calculated by adding any adjustments for over- or under-funding occurring in prior FYs to the allocation calculated in the previous step. These adjustments typically result from late reporting of FCAS changes, or conveyances.
REPGRANT = GRANT2 + ADJUST1.
Where:
REPGRANT = Initial Allocation Amount in current FY (see § 1000.342).
GRANT2 = preliminary total allocation after applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8) but before applying the Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
ADJUST1 = adjustments for over- or under-funding occurring in prior FYs.
10. The Undisbursed Funds Factor is determined by subtracting the sum of each tribe's Initial Allocation Amount for the prior three FYs from the IHBG amounts in HUD's Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) on October 1 of the FY for which the new allocation is being determined. If the undisbursed funds factor is
$0 and the tribe's initial allocation for the FY exceeds $5 million, its final allocation will be the initial allocation minus the Undisbursed Funds Factor or its 1996 minimum, whichever is greater. Reductions to the initial allocation amounts due to the Undisbursed Funds Factor are summed and redistributed to other tribes in proportion to their initial needs allocation, NEED1PD, calculated above.
If REPGRANT
= $5 MILLION and UNDISB$
(REPGRANTYR1 + REPGRANTYR2 + REPGRANTYR3), then UDFFtest = 1.
Where:
REPGRANT = Initial Allocation Amount in current FY.
REPGRANTYR1 = Initial Allocation Amount in one year prior to current FY.
REPGRANTYR2 = Initial Allocation Amount in two years prior to current FY.
REPGRANTYR3 = Initial Allocation Amount in three years prior to current FY.
UDFFTest = is an indicator as to whether the tribe will give up a portion of its
needs allocation due to an excessive amount of undisbursed funds.
For tribes whose UDFFtest = 1, a reduction will occur as follows:
REPGRANTaftUDFF = (GRANT2 − (UNDISB$ − (REPGRANTYR1 + REPGRANTYR2 + REPGRANTYR3))
Except if, OPMOD96
(GRANT2 − (UNDISB$ − (REPGRANTYR + REPGRANTYR2 + REPGRANTYR3)) then, REPGRANTaftUDFF = OPMOD96.
Where:
REPGRANTaftUDFF = Initial Allocation Amount in current FY adjusted for the Undisbursed Funds Factor.
GRANT2 = preliminary total allocation after applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8) but before applying the Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
UNDISB$ = amount in HUD's LOCCS on October 1 of the FY.
REPGRANTYR1 = Initial Allocation Amount in one year prior to current FY.
REPGRANTYR2 = Initial Allocation Amount in two years prior to current FY.
REPGRANTYR3 = Initial Allocation Amount in three years prior to current FY.
OPMOD96 = funding received by tribe in FY 1996 for Operating Subsidy and Modernization.
So the UDFFadj = REPGRANTaftUDFF − GRANT2 and UDFFadjTOT= Absolute value of the sum of UDFF adjustments for tribes subject to reduction.
If UDFFtest is not equal to 1, tribes receive a portion of the funds recovered under the UDFF provision based on their share of total needs excluding any tribes with UDFFtest = 1. For these tribes, then:
UDFFadj = (NEED1PD/
S
Need1PD) * UDFFadjTOT).
REPGRANTaftUDFF = REPGRANT + UDFFadj.
Where:
UDFFadj = amount of the Undisbursed Fund Factor adjustments. Negative amount represents excess undisbursed funds. Positive represents amounts being transferred to other tribes without excess undisbursed funds.
NEED1PD = the Tribe's needs allocation after applying the phase down adjustment schedule.
UDFFadjTOT = absolute value of the sum of Undisbursed Fund Factor adjustments for tribes that meet the criteria for reduction and is equal to the sum available for redistribution among other tribes based on their initial needs allocation.
REPGRANTaftUDFF = Initial Allocation Amount in current FY adjusted for the Undisbursed Funds Factor.
REPGRANT = Initial Allocation Amount in current FY.
11. A final adjustment is made under § 1000.329 which allocates available carryover amounts up to $3 million to achieve minimum total allocations. Tribes that certify in their Indian Housing Plans the presence of any eligible households at or below 80 percent of median income and whose total allocation determined in the preceding step is less than 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, will have their allocation adjusted upwards to 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, or to a lesser percentage which can be achieved for all eligible tribes with available carryover funds set-aside for this purpose.
MINGRANT = APPROP * 0.0001547.
Where:
APPROP = current FY appropriation for the IHBG program less amounts in the Appropriations Act mandated for purposes other than the formula allocation.
If (GRANT2 + UDFFADJ)
MINGRANT and income-based need has been identified in a tribe's IHP, then tribe qualifies for MINGRANTADJ. For Tribes that qualify, calculate:
MINGRTADJTEST = MINGRANT—(GRANT2 + UDFFADJ).
If the Sum for all tribes of MINGRTADJTEST
MGHOLD, then:
MINGRANTADJ = MINGRTADJTEST.
If the Sum for all tribes of MINGRANTADJTEST
MGHOLD, then:
MINGRANTADJ = MINGRANTADJTEST * (MGHOLD/
S
MINGRANTADJ)
Where:
GRANT2 is the approximate grant allocation in any given year for any given tribe.
UDFFADJ = amount of UDFF adjustment.
MINGRANT = Minimum total allocation established in § 1000.329.
MINGRANTADJTEST = amount required to bring all qualifying tribes' allocations up to the minimum total allocation amount. This amount can then be compared.
MGHOLD = amount set-aside for allocation under minimum total grant provision (see Step 2).
MINGRANTADJ = actual amount of the minimum grant adjustment that can be accommodated with the amount set aside from carryover for this purpose.
12. A tribe's final allocation consists of the initial current FY formula allocation with three adjustments.
FINALALLOCATION = GRANT2 + ADJUST1 + UDFFadj + MINGRANTADJ
Where:
FINALALLOCATION = total amount a tribe is eligible to receive as a grant in the current FY.
GRANT2 = preliminary total allocation after applying 1996 Operating Subsidy and Modernization minimum funding (see Step 8) but before applying the Undisbursed Funds Factor (see Step 9) and Minimum Grant provision (see Step 10).
ADJUST1 = adjustments for over- or under-funding occurring in prior FYs.
UDFFadj = amount of the Undisbursed Fund Factor adjustments. Negative amount represents excess undisbursed funds. Positive represents amounts being transferred to other tribes without excess undisbursed funds.
MINGRANTADJ = actual amount of the minimum grant adjustment that can be accommodated with the amount set aside from carryover for this purpose.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1003.1
Applicability and scope.
The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible applicants under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska native villages.
§ 1003.2
Program objective.
The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee covered under the Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaska native communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of tribal financial support for community development activities below the level of such support before the availability of this assistance.
§ 1003.3
Nature of program.
The selection of single purpose grantees under subpart B of this part is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of grantees for funds will reflect consideration of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing tribally determined need. The selection of grantees of imminent threat grants under the provisions of subpart B of this part is not competitive in nature. However, applicants for funding under either subpart must have the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0191)
§ 1003.6
Waivers.
Upon determination of good cause, HUD may waive any provision of this part not required by statute. Each waiver must be in writing and must be supported by documentation of the pertinent facts and grounds.

# Subpart B—Allocation of Funds
§ 1003.100
General.
(a)
Types of grants.
Two types of grants are available under the Indian CDBG Program.
(1)
Single purpose grants
provide funds for one or more single purpose projects consisting of an activity or set of activities designed to meet a specific community development need. This type of grant is awarded through competition with other single purpose projects.
(2)
Imminent threat grants
alleviate an imminent threat to public health or safety that requires immediate resolution. This type of grant is awarded only after an Area ONAP determines that such conditions exist and if funds are available for such grants.
(b)
Size of grants
—(1)
Ceilings.
Each Area ONAP may recommend grant ceilings for single purpose grant applications. Single purpose grant ceilings for each Area ONAP shall be established in the NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability).
(2)
Individual grant amounts.
An Area ONAP may approve a grant amount less than the amount requested. In doing so, the Area ONAP may take into account the size of the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives, the reasonableness of the project costs, and the administrative capacity of the applicant to complete the activities in a timely manner.
[61 FR 40090, July 31, 1996. Redesignated at 62 FR 12349, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 4580, Jan. 17, 2001; 66 FR 8176, Jan. 30, 2001]
§ 1003.101
Area ONAP allocation of funds.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the Area ONAPs responsible for the program on the following basis:
(1) Each Area ONAP will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance of the ICDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated and any amount retained by the Headquarters ONAP to fund imminent threat grants pursuant to the provisions of § 1003.402 is subtracted, will be allocated to each Area ONAP based on the most recent data complied and published by the United States Bureau of the Census referable to the same point or period in time, as follows:
(i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total eligible Indian population;
(ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of poverty among the eligible Indian population; and
(iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population.
(b) HUD will use other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing funds to the Area ONAPs if funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year if it is determined that the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to accomplish the purpose. HUD will use other criteria if it is determined that, based on a limited appropriation of funds, the use of the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to obtain an equitable allocation of funds.
(c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those tribes and villages that are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year.
§ 1003.102
Use of recaptured and unawarded funds.
(a) The Assistant Secretary will determine on a case-by-case basis the use of grant funds which are:
(1) Recaptured by HUD under the provisions of § 1003.703 or § 1003.704;
(2) Recaptured by HUD at the time of the closeout of a program; or
(3) Unawarded after the completion by an Area ONAP of a funding competition.
(b) The recaptured or unawarded funds will remain with the Area ONAP to which they were originally allocated unless the Assistant Secretary determines that there is an overriding reason to redistribute these funds outside of the Area ONAP's jurisdiction. The recaptured funds may be used to fund the highest ranking unfunded project from the most recent funding competition, an imminent threat, or other uses. Unawarded funds may be used to fund an imminent threat or other uses.

# Subpart C—Eligible Activities
§ 1003.200
General policies.
An activity may be assisted in whole or in part with ICDBG funds only if the activity meets the eligibility requirements of section 105 of the Act as further defined in this subpart and if the criteria for compliance with the primary objective of the Act set forth under § 1003.208 have been met. The requirements for compliance with the primary objective of the Act do not apply to imminent threat grants funded under subpart E of this part.
§ 1003.201
Basic eligible activities.
ICDBG funds may be used for the following activities:
(a)
Acquisition.
Acquisition in whole or in part by the grantee, or other public or private nonprofit entity, by purchase, long-term lease, donation, or otherwise, of real property (including air rights, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other interests therein) for any public purpose, subject to the limitations of § 1003.207.
(b)
Disposition.
Disposition, through sale, lease, donation, or otherwise, of any real property acquired with ICDBG funds or its retention for public purposes, including reasonable costs of temporarily managing such property or property acquired under urban renewal, provided that the proceeds from any such disposition shall be program income subject to the requirements set forth in § 1003.503.
(c)
Public facilities and improvements.
Acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or installation of public facilities and improvements, except as provided in § 1003.207(a), carried out by the grantee or other public or private nonprofit entities. In undertaking such activities, design features and improvements which promote energy efficiency may be included. [However, activities under this paragraph may be directed to the removal of material and architectural barriers that restrict the mobility and accessibility of elderly or severely disabled persons to publicly owned and privately owned buildings, facilities, and improvements including those provided for in § 1003.207(a)(1).] Such activities may also include the execution of architectural design features, and similar treatments intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of facilities and improvements receiving ICDBG assistance. Facilities designed for use in providing shelter for persons having special needs are considered public facilities and not subject to the prohibition of new housing construction described in § 1003.207(b)(3). Such facilities include shelters for the homeless; convalescent homes; hospitals, nursing homes; battered spouse shelters; halfway houses for run-away children, drug offenders or parolees; group homes for mentally retarded persons and temporary housing for disaster victims. In certain cases, nonprofit entities and subrecipients including those specified in § 1003.204 may acquire title to public facilities. When such facilities are owned by nonprofit entities or subrecipients, they shall be operated so as to be open for use by the general public during all normal hours of operation. Public facilities and improvements eligible for assistance under this paragraph (c) are subject to the following policies in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section:
(1)
Special policies governing facilities.
The following special policies apply to:
(i)
Facilities containing both eligible and ineligible uses.
A public facility otherwise eligible for assistance under the ICDBG program may be provided with
ICDBG funds even if it is part of a multiple use building containing ineligible uses, if:
(A) The facility which is otherwise eligible and proposed for assistance will occupy a designated and discrete area within the larger facility; and
(B) The grantee can determine the costs attributable to the facility proposed for assistance as separate and distinct from the overall costs of the multiple-use building and/or facility. Allowable costs are limited to those attributable to the eligible portion of the building or facility.
(ii)
Equipment purchase.
As stated in § 1003.207(b)(1), the purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible. However, the purchase of construction equipment for use as part of a solid waste facility is eligible. In addition, the purchase of fire protection equipment is considered to be an integral part of a public facility, and, therefore, the purchase of such equipment is also eligible.
(2)
Fees for use of facilities.
Reasonable fees may be charged for the use of the facilities assisted with ICDBG funds, but charges such as excessive membership fees, which will have the effect of precluding low and moderate income persons from using the facilities, are not permitted.
(3)
Special assessments under the ICDBG program.
The following policies relate to special assessments under the ICDBG program:
(i)
Definition of special assessment.
The term
special assessment
means the recovery of the capital costs of a public improvement, such as streets, water or sewer lines, curbs, and gutters, through a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement, or a one-time charge made as a condition of access to a public improvement. This term does not relate to taxes, or the establishment of the value of real estate for the purpose of levying real estate, property, or ad valorem taxes, and does not include periodic charges based on the use of a public improvement, such as water or sewer user charges, even if such charges include the recovery of all or some portion of the capital costs of the public improvement.
(ii)
Special assessments to recover capital costs.
Where ICDBG funds are used to pay all or part of the cost of a public improvement, special assessments may be imposed as follows:
(A) Special assessments to recover the ICDBG funds may be made only against properties owned and occupied by persons not of low and moderate income. Such assessments constitute program income.
(B) Special assessments to recover the non-ICDBG portion may be made provided that ICDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment on behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income persons; except that ICDBG funds need not be used to pay the special assessments on behalf of properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons if the grantee certifies that it does not have sufficient ICDBG funds to pay the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner-occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are not program income.
(iii)
Public improvements not initially assisted with ICDBG funds.
The payment of special assessments with ICDBG funds constitutes ICDBG assistance to the public improvement. Therefore, ICDBG funds may be used to pay special assessments provided:
(A) The installation of the public improvements was carried out in compliance with requirements applicable to activities assisted under this part including environmental and citizen participation requirements; and
(B) The installation of the public improvement meets a criterion for the primary objective in § 1003.208; and,
(C) The requirements of § 1003.201(c)(3)(ii))(B) are met.
(d)
Clearance activities.
Clearance, demolition, and removal of buildings and improvements, including movement of structures to other sites. Demolition of HUD-assisted housing units may be undertaken only with the prior approval of HUD.
(e)
Public services.
