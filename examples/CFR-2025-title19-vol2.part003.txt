The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based will be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry must not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.

# X. General Manufacturing Drawback Ruling Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for Piece Goods (T.D. 83-73)

# A. Same 8-Digit HTSUS Classification (Parallel Columns)
Imported merchandise or drawback products
1
to be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products.
Duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as that designated which will be used in the production of the exported products.
Piece goods.
Piece goods.
The piece goods used in manufacture will be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as follows:
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;
2. A tolerance of 4% in the aggregate thread count per square inch so that the piece goods used in manufacture will have an aggregate thread count within 4%, more or less of the aggregate thread count of the imported piece goods which will be designated. In each case, the average yarn number of the domestic piece goods will be the same or greater than the average yarn number of the imported piece goods designated, and in each case, the substitution and tolerance will be employed only within the same family of fabrics,
i.e.,
print cloth for print cloth, gingham for gingham, greige for greige, dyed for dyed, bleached for bleached, etc. The piece goods used in manufacture of the exported articles will be designated as containing the identical percentage of identical fibers as the piece goods designated as the basis for allowance of drawback; for example, piece goods containing 65% cotton and 35% dacron will be designated against the use of piece goods shown to contain 65% cotton and 35% dacron. The actual fiber composition may vary slightly from that described on the invoice or other acceptance of the fabric as having the composition described on documents in accordance with trade practices.

# B. Exported Articles on Which Drawback Will Be Claimed
Finished piece goods.

# C. General Statement
The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s. 55027(2) and 55207(1) (
see
§ 190.9).

# D. Process of Manufacture or Production
Piece goods are subject to any one of the following finishing productions:
1. Bleaching,
2. Mercerizing,
3. Dyeing,
4. Printing,
5. A combination of the above, or
6. Any additional finishing processes.

# E. Multiple Products
Not applicable.

# F. Waste
Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the quantity of rag waste, if any, and its value. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical
to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the piece goods put into the finishing processes. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records must also be kept.

# G. Shrinkage, Gain, and Spoilage
Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain and spoilage will also be kept.

# H. [Reserved]

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the designated merchandise;
2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the designated merchandise
2
used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles produced.”
3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation of the designated merchandise, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced
3
the exported articles.
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# J. Inventory Procedures
The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer must show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures and Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of all legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.

# K. Basis of Claim for Drawback
Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of piece goods, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used to produce the exported articles less the amount of piece goods which the value of the waste would replace.

# L. General Requirements
The manufacturer or producer will:
1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;
2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;
4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix (I. General Instructions, 1 through 10), the corporate name, or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;
5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and
6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 190 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

# XI. General Manufacturing Drawback Ruling Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for Raw Sugar (T.D. 83-59)
Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) upon the exportation of hard or soft refined sugars and sirups manufactured from raw sugar, subject to the following special requirements:
A. The drawback allowance must not exceed an amount calculated pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on a quantity of raw sugar designated by the
refiner which contains a quantity of sucrose not in excess of the quantity required to manufacture the exported sugar or sirup, ascertained as provided in this general rule.
B. The refined sugars and sirups must have been manufactured with the use of duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic sugar, or combinations thereof, within 5 years after the date of importation, and must have been exported within 5 years from the date of importation of the designated sugar.
C. All granulated sugar testing by the polariscope 99.5 [degrees] and over will be deemed hard refined sugar. All refined sugar testing by the polariscope less than 99.5 [degrees] will be deemed soft refined sugar. All “blackstrap,” “unfiltered sirup,” and “final molasses” will be deemed sirup.
D. The imported duty-paid sugar selected by the refiner as the basis for the drawback claim (designated sugar) must be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as that used in the manufacture of the exported refined sugar or sirup and must have been used within 5 years after the date of importation. Duty-paid sugar which has been used at a plant of a refiner within 5 years after the date on which it was imported by such refiner may be designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on refined sugars or sirups manufactured at another plant of the same refiner.
E. For the purpose of distributing the drawback, relative values must be established between hard refined (granulated) sugar, soft refined (various grades) sugar, and sirups at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract will be deemed the time of separation of the sugars and sirups covered by such abstract.
F. The sucrose allowance per pound on hard refined (granulated) sugar established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, will be applied to hard refined sugar commercially known as loaf, cut loaf, cube, pressed, crushed, or powdered sugar manufactured from the granulated sugar covered by the abstract.
G. The sucrose allowance per gallon on sirup established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, will be applied to sirup further advanced in value by filtration or otherwise, unless such sirup is the subject of a special manufacturing drawback ruling.
H. As to each lot of imported or domestic sugar used in the manufacture of refined sugar or sirup on which drawback is to be claimed, the raw stock records must show the refiner's raw lot number, the number and character of the packages, the settlement weight in pounds, the settlement polarization, and the 8-digit HTSUS classification. Such records covering imported sugar must show, in addition to the foregoing, the import entry number, date of importation, name of importing carrier, country of origin, the Government weight, and the Government polarization.
I. The melt records must show the date of melting, the number of pounds of each lot of raw sugar melted, and the full analysis at melting.
J. There must be kept a daily record of final products boiled showing the date of the melt, the date of boiling, the magma filling serial number, the number of the vacuum pan or crystallizer filling, the date worked off, and the sirup filling serial number.
K. The sirup manufacture records must show the date of boiling, the period of the melt, the sirup filling serial number, the number of barrels in the filling, the magma filling serial number, the quantity of sirup, its disposition in tanks or barrels and the refinery serial manufacture number.
L. The refined sugar stock records must show the refinery serial manufacture number, the period of the melt, the date of manufacture, the grade of sugar produced, its polarization, the number and kind of packages, and the net weight. When soft sugars are manufactured, the commercial grade number and quantity of each must be shown.
M. Each lot of hard or soft refined sugar and each lot of sirup manufactured, regardless of the character of the containers or vessels in which it is packed or stored, must be marked immediately with the date of manufacture and the refinery manufacture number applied to it in the refinery records provided for and shown in the abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, from such records. If all the sugar or sirup contained in any lot manufactured is not intended for exportation, only such of the packages as are intended for exportation need be marked as prescribed above, provided there is filed with the drawback office immediately after such marking a statement showing the date of manufacture, the refinery manufacture number, the number of packages marked, and the quantity of sugar or sirup contained therein. No drawback will be allowed in such case on any sugar or sirup in excess of the quantity shown on the statement as having been marked. If any packages of sugar or sirup so marked are repacked into other containers, the new containers must be marked with the marks which appeared on the original containers and a revised statement covering such repacking and remarking must be filed with the drawback office. If sirups from more than one lot are stored in the same tank, the refinery records must show the refinery manufacture number and the quantity of sirup from each lot contained in such tank.
N. An abstract from the foregoing records covering manufacturing periods of not less than 1 month nor more than 3 months, unless a different period will have been authorized, must be filed when drawback is to be claimed on any part of the refined sugar or sirup manufactured during such period. Such
abstract must be filed by each refiner with the drawback office where drawback claims are filed on the basis of this general ruling.

1
used to produce the exported articles; and
1
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles produced.”
3. That, within 5 years of the date of importation of the designated merchandise, the refiner used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, the refiner produced
2
the exported articles.
2
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.
Y. General requirements. The refiner will:

# XII. General Manufacturing Drawback Ruling Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for Steel (T.D. 81-74)

# A. Same 8-Digit HTSUS Classification (Parallel Columns)
Imported merchandise or drawback products
1
to be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products.
Duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as that designated which will be used in the production of the exported products.
Steel of one general class, e.g., an ingot, falling within on SAE, AISI, or ASTM
2
specification and, if the specification contains one or more grades, falling within one grade of the specification.
Steel of the same general class, specification, and grade as the steel in the column immediately to the left hereof.
1. The duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used instead of the imported, duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be interchangeable for manufacturing purposes with the duty-paid steel. To be interchangeable a steel must be able to be used in place of the substituted steel without any additional processing step in the manufacture of the article on which drawback is to be claimed.
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
2
Standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), or the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).
2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by “price extra,” and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 4, infra, insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.
3. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the Parallel Columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products)
will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within an SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, then any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel must be covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification).

# B. Exported Articles on Which Drawback Will Be Claimed
The exported articles will have been manufactured in the United States using steels described in the Parallel Columns above.

# C. General Statement
The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account.
The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (
see
§ 190.9).

# D. Process of Manufacture or Production
The steel described in the Parallel Columns will be used to manufacture or produce articles in accordance with § 190.2.

# E. Multiple Products
Not applicable.

# F. Waste
No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of steel appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), quantity, and disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.

# G. Loss or Gain
The manufacturer or producer will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the steel caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.

# H. [Reserved]

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the designated merchandise;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the designated merchandise
3
used to produce the exported articles;

# E. Multiple Products
Not applicable.

# F. Waste
Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the quantity of rag waste, if any, its value, and its disposition. If no waste results, records will be maintained to establish that fact. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the woven piece goods put into process. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept.

# G. Shrinkage, Gain, and Spoilage
Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer must show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain, and spoilage will also be kept.

# H. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:
1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise; and
2. The quantity of imported merchandise
2
used in producing the exported articles.
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of the sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles.”
To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# I. Inventory Procedures
The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer must show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures and Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of all legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.
The records of the manufacturer or producer must show, as to each lot of piece goods manufactured or produced for exportation with benefit of drawback, the lot number and the date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production, the quantity, identity, value, and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the imported (or drawback product) piece goods used, the condition in which imported or received (whether in the gray, bleached, dyed, or mercerized), the working allowance specified in the contract under which they are received, the process or processes applied thereto, and the quantity and description of the piece goods obtained. The records must also show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred.

# J. Basis of Claim for Drawback
Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible merchandise that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible material used to produce the exported articles, less the amount of that merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. (If remnants and/or spoilage occur during manufacture or production, the quantity of imported merchandise used will be determined by deducting from the quantity of piece goods received and put into manufacture or production the quantity of such remnants and/or spoilage. The remaining quantity will be reduced by the quantity thereof which the value of the rag waste, if any, would replace.)

# K. General Requirements
The manufacturer or producer will:
1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;
2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;

# PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 1313(b) (PARALLEL COLUMNS—SAME 8-DIGIT CLASSIFICATION)
Imported merchandise or drawback products
1
to be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products.
Duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise, of the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as that designated which will be used in the production of the exported products.
1.
1.
2.
2.
3.
3.
(Following the items
listed in the Parallel Columns, the applicant must make a statement affirming the same 8-digit HTSUS classification of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
The imported merchandise designated in our claims will be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback.
(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise, which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise, is classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification. To enable CBP to rule on the same 8-digit HTSUS classification, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles. The application must also include the Bill of Materials and/or formulas annotated with the HTSUS classifications.)
(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the identity of the merchandise are specified in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the the same 8-digit HTSUS classification statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different identities.)
(The descriptions should be sufficient to classify the merchandise in the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number included in the Parallel Columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and the 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the imported merchandise. The right-hand column will consist of the name and the 8-digit HTSUS subheading number for the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic designated merchandise. Amendments to rulings will be required if any changes to the HTSUS classifications occur.)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name, state what the product is (e.g., a herbicide). There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, include equations of any chemical reactions. Including a flow chart in the description of the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating how a manufacture or production occurs. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)
(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)

# MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

# 1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise into two or more products. If applicable, list all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)
(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products are necessarily produced in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors, and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders, does not call for relative value distribution.)
(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1,500 or
1/5
. The relative value of B is
2/15
and of product C is
2/3
, calculated in the same manner. This means that
1/5
of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A,
2/15
to product B, and
2/3
to product C.)
(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not permitted on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) The nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)

# 2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)
(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon
the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less any valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered.
See
“Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured by weight unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the merchandise we designate;
2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated merchandise
2
we used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, we produced
3
the exported articles.
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading “PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED”. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)

# RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE

# RECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE

# BILLS OF MATERIALS

# MANUFACTURING RECORDS

# WASTE RECORDS

# RECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC MERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME 8-DIGIT HTSUS SUBHEADING NUMBER WITHIN 5 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF IMPORTATION

# FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# SHIPPING RECORDS
(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is best to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.) (If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, you must state: “All legal requirements will be met by our inventory procedures.” However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application, a judgment as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's recordkeeping procedures if those procedures are solely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)
(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste, or the waste is valueless or unrecovered. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.) (For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)
(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, as reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “used
in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate a “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule follows:)
We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

to be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products.
Duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise of the Same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as that designated which will be used in the production of the exported products.
1.
1.
2.
2.
3.
3.
(Following the items listed in the Parallel Columns, the applicant must make a statement affirming the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading numberof the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:
)
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
The imported merchandise designated in our claims will be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback, such that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the designated merchandise.
(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise, which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise, is “classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number.” To enable CBP to rule on the proper “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number,” the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise, and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise used to produce the exported articles. The application must also include the Bill of Materials and/or formulas annotated with the HTSUS classification.)
(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the identity of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different identities.
(The descriptions of the “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number” merchandise should be included in the Parallel Columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the imported merchandise. The right-hand column will consist of the name and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number for the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic designated merchandise. Amendments to the ruling will be required if any changes to the HTSUS classifications occur.)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, include equations of any chemical reactions. Including a flow chart in the description of the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating how manufacture or production occurs. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)
(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)

# MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

# 1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise into two or more products. If applicable, list all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product or by-product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)
(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products are necessarily produced in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors, and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders, does not call for relative value distribution.)
(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1,500 or
1/5
. The relative value of B is
2/15
and of product C is
2/3
, calculated in the same manner. This means that
1/5
of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A,
2/15
to product B, and
2/3
to product C.)
(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not permitted on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) The nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)

# 2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)
(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation, then state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as waste. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis, and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered, but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles less any valuable waste, state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered.
See
“Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the merchandise we designate;
2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated merchandise
2
we used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, we produced
3
the exported articles;
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback
recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To help ensure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)

# RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE

# RECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE

# BILLS OF MATERIALS

# MANUFACTURING RECORDS

# WASTE RECORDS

# RECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC MERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME 8-DIGIT HTSUS SUBHEADING WITHIN 5 YEARS AFTER IMPORTATION OF THE DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE

# FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# SHIPPING RECORDS
(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is better to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)
(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, you must state: “All legal requirements will be met by our inventory procedures.” However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application, a judgment as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's recordkeeping procedures if those procedures are solely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)
(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste, or the waste is valueless or unrecovered. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)
(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)
(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, as reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “used in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages, or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product, before the material is actually used in production.)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)
We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

# AGREEMENTS
The Applicant specifically agrees that it will:
1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;
2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;
4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the number or locations of its offices or factories, the corporate name, the persons who will sign drawback documents, the basis of claim used for calculating drawback, the decision to use or not to use an agent under § 190.9 or the identity of an agent under that section, or the corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;
5. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to CBP Headquarters, all other changes affecting information contained in this application;

Dear Sir or Madam: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(d), and part 190 of the CBP Regulations. We request that CBP authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

# NAME AND ADDRESS AND IRS NUMBER (WITH SUFFIX) OF APPLICANT
(Section 190.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback must apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.7 of the CBP Regulations. CBP will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (
see
§ 190.8(a)).)

# LOCATION OF FACTORY
(Provide the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. Indicate if the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, and indicate if the applicant is operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)

# PERSONS WHO WILL SIGN DRAWBACK DOCUMENTS
(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (
see
footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)

# GENERAL STATEMENT
(The exact material placed under this heading in individual cases will vary, but it should include such information as the type of business in which the manufacturer is engaged, whether the manufacturer is manufacturing for its own account or is performing the operation on a toll basis (including commission or conversion basis) for the account of others, whether the manufacturer is a direct exporter of its products or sells or delivers them to others for export, and whether drawback will be claimed by the manufacturer or by others.)
(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 190.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (
see
§ 190.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (
see
§ 190.8 and this Appendix B).)
(Regarding drawback operations conducted under § 1313(d), the data may describe the flavoring extracts, medicinal, or toilet preparations (including perfumery) manufactured with the use of domestic tax-paid alcohol; and where such alcohol is obtained or purchased.)

# TAX-PAID MATERIAL USED UNDER SECTION 1313(d)
(Describe or list the tax-paid material)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(d) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. “Manufacture or production” is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(d), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. Describe how the tax-paid material is processed into the export article.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered, but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation, does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in producing the exported articles (less any valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered.
See
“Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that the domestic tax-paid alcohol is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the domestic tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of domestic tax-paid alcohol, and
2. The quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol
1
we used in producing the exported articles.
1
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the tax has been paid on the domestic alcohol. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19
U.S.C. 1313(d) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To help ensure compliance the following areas should be included in your discussion:)

# RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# MANUFACTURING RECORDS

# FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)
(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of flavoring extracts and medicinal or toilet preparation (including perfumery).)
(For example, if 100 gallons of alcohol, valued at $1.00 per gallon, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 100% of the tax paid on the 100 gallons of domestic alcohol used to produce the exported articles.)
The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 gallons of domestic alcohol which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 gallons used in as set forth previously.)
(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of domestic tax-paid alcohol. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the quantity of tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the exported articles, as reduced by the quantity of such alcohol which the value of the waste would replace.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 gallons of waste had a value of $.50 per gallon, then the 10 gallons of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 gallons of the tax-paid alcohol. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 gallons of the alcohol used, and drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on 95 gallons of alcohol rather than on the 100 gallons “used in” or the 90 gallons “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by schedule follows:)
We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback
may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

# FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# SHIPPING RECORDS

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)
(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported article.)
(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 100 pounds of imported material used in constructing and equipping the exported articles.)
(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material which appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of imported material which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported product, as reduced by the quantity of such material which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the imported material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 95 pounds of imported material rather than on the 100 pounds “used in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed
when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)
(An “abstract' is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract' method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)
We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

(ii)
Copies.
Letters of notification of intent shall be submitted in duplicate unless claims are to be filed at more than one drawback office, in which case one additional copy of the letter of notification shall be filed for each additional office. Upon issuance of a letter of acknowledgment (paragraph (c)(1) of this section), the drawback office with which the letter of notification is submitted shall forward the additional copy to such additional office(s), with a copy of the letter of acknowledgment.
(3)
Information required.
Each manufacturer or producer submitting a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under this section must provide the following specific detailed information:
(i) Name and address of manufacturer or producer (if the manufacturer or producer is a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a corporation, the subsidiary corporation must submit a letter of notification in its own name);
(ii) In the case of a business entity, the names of the persons listed in § 191.6(a)(1) through (6) who will sign drawback documents;
(iii) Locations of the factories which will operate under the letter of notification;
(iv) Identity (by T.D. number and title) of the general manufacturing drawback ruling under which the manufacturer or producer will operate;
(v) Description of the merchandise and articles, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling;
(vi) Description of the manufacturing or production process, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling;
(vii) Basis of claim used for calculating drawback; and

§ 191.9
Agency.
(a)
General.
An owner of the identified merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and/or the substituted other merchandise that is used to produce the exported articles may employ another person to do part, or all, of the manufacture or production under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b) and § 191.2(q) of this subpart. For purposes of this section, such owner is the principal and such other person is the agent. Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), the principal shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of merchandise used in manufacture or production by the agent. The principal must be able to establish by its manufacturing records, the manufacturing records of its agent(s), or the manufacturing records of both (or all) parties, compliance with all requirements of this part (see, in particular, § 191.26 of this part).
(b)
Requirements
—(1)
Contract.
The manufacturer must establish that it is the principal in a contract between it and its agent who actually does the work on either the designated or substituted merchandise, or both, for the principal. The contract must include:
(i) Terms of compensation to show that the relationship is an agency rather than a sale;
(ii) How transfers of merchandise and articles will be recorded by the principal and its agent;
(iii) The work to be performed on the merchandise by the agent for the principal;
(iv) The degree of control that is to be exercised by the principal over the agent's performance of work;
(v) The party who is to bear the risk of loss on the merchandise while it is in the agent's custody; and
(vi) The period that the contract is in effect.
(2)
Ownership of the merchandise by the principal.
The records of the principal and/or the agent must establish that the principal had legal and equitable title to the merchandise before receipt by the agent. The right of the agent to assert a lien on the merchandise for work performed does not derogate the principal's ownership interest under this section.
(3)
Sales prohibited.
The relationship between the principal and agent must not be that of a seller and buyer. If the parties' records show that, with respect to the merchandise that is the subject of the principal-agent contract, the merchandise is sold to the agent by the principal, or the articles manufactured by the agent are sold to the principal by the agent, those records are inadequate to establish existence of a principal-agency relationship under this section.
(c)
Specific manufacturing drawback rulings; general manufacturing drawback rulings
—(1)
Owner.
An owner who intends to operate under the principal-agent procedures of this section must state that intent in any letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.7 of this subpart or in any application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.8 of this subpart.
(2)
Agent.
Each agent operating under this section must have filed a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7), for an agent, covering the articles manufactured or produced, or have obtained a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8), as appropriate.

§ 191.14
Identification of merchandise or articles by accounting method.
(a)
General.
This section provides for the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes by the use of accounting methods. This section applies to identification of merchandise or articles in inventory or storage, as well as identification of merchandise used in manufacture or production (see § 191.2(h) of this subpart). This section is not applicable to situations in which the drawback law authorizes substitution (substitution is allowed in specified situations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), 1313(j)(2), 1313(k), and 1313(p); this section does apply to situations in these subsections in which substitution is not allowed, as well as to the subsections of the drawback law under which no substitution is allowed). When substitution is authorized, merchandise or articles may be substituted without reference to this section, under the criteria and conditions specifically authorized in the statutory and regulatory provisions providing for the substitution.
(b)
Conditions and criteria for identification by accounting method.
Manufacturers, producers, claimants, or other appropriate persons may identify for drawback purposes lots of merchandise or articles under this section, subject to each of the following conditions and criteria:
(1) The lots of merchandise or articles to be so identified must be fungible (see § 191.2(o) of this part);
(2) The person using the identification method must be able to establish that inventory records (for example, material control records), prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, account for the lots of merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory. Even if merchandise or articles are received or withdrawn at different geographical locations, if such inventory records treat receipts or withdrawals as being from the same inventory, those inventory records may be used to identify the merchandise or articles under this section, subject to the conditions of this section. If any such inventory records (that is, inventory records prepared and used in the ordinary course of business) treat
receipts and withdrawals as being from different inventories, those inventory records must be used and receipts into or withdrawals from the different inventories may not be accounted for together. If units of merchandise or articles can be specifically identified (for example, by serial number), the merchandise or articles must be specifically identified and may not be identified by accounting method, unless it is established that inventory records, prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, treat the merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory (subject to the above conditions);
(3) Unless otherwise provided in this section or specifically approved by Customs (by a binding ruling under part 177 of this chapter), all receipts (or inputs) into and all withdrawals from the inventory must be recorded in the accounting record;
(4) The records which support any identification method under this section are subject to verification by Customs (see § 191.61 of this part). If Customs requests such verification, the person using the identification method must be able to demonstrate how, under generally accepted accounting procedures, the records which support the identification method used account for all merchandise or articles in, and all receipts into and withdrawals from, the inventory, and the drawback per unit for each receipt and withdrawal; and
(5) Any accounting method which is used by a person for drawback purposes under this section must be used without variation with other methods for a period of at least one year, unless approval is given by Customs for a shorter period.
(c)
Approved accounting methods.
The following accounting methods are approved for use in the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes under this section.
(1)
First-in, first-out (FIFO)
—(i)
General.
The FIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the first merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.
(ii)
Example.
If the beginning inventory is zero, 100 units with $1 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 2nd of the month, 50 units with no drawback attributable per unit are received into inventory on the 5th of the month, 75 units are withdrawn for domestic (non-export) shipment on the 10th of the month, 75 units with $2 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 15th of the month, 100 units are withdrawn for export on the 20th of the month, and no other receipts or withdrawals occurred in the month, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $75 (25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, 50 units from the receipt on the 5th with no drawback attributable per unit, and 25 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 25 with $2 drawback unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $2 drawback/unit).
(2)
Last-in, first out (LIFO)
—(i)
General.
The LIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the last merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the newest (last-in) merchandise
or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.
(ii)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $175 (75 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit and 25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $0 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (all with $1 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (75 with $1 drawback/unit and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (75 with $2 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $1 drawback/unit).
(3)
Low-to-high
—(i)
General.
The low-to-high method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles in inventory. Merchandise or articles with no drawback attributable to them (for example, domestic merchandise or duty-free merchandise) must be accounted for and are treated as having the lowest drawback attributable to them. Under this method, withdrawals are from the merchandise or articles with the least amount of drawback attributable to them, then those with the next higher amount, and so forth. If the same amount of drawback is attributable to more than one lot of merchandise or articles, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles among those lots with the same amount of drawback attributable. Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for unused merchandise drawback) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).
(ii)
Ordinary
—(A)
Method.
Under the ordinary low-to-high method, all receipts into and all withdrawals from the inventory are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal, whether for export or domestic shipment, is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles available in the inventory.
(B)
Example.
In this example, the beginning inventory is zero, and receipts into and withdrawals from the inventory are as follows:
Date
Receipt
($ per unit)
Withdrawals
Jan. 2
100 (zero)
Jan. 5
50 ($1.00)
Jan. 15
50 (export).
Jan. 20
50 ($1.01)
Jan. 25
50 ($1.02)
Jan. 28
50 (domestic).
Jan. 31
50 ($1.03)
Feb. 5
100 (export).
Feb. 10
50 ($.95)
Feb. 15
50 (export).
Feb. 20
50 (zero)
Feb. 23
50 (domestic).
Feb. 25
50 ($1.05)
Feb. 28
100 (export).
Mar. 5
50 ($1.06)
Mar. 10
50 ($.85)
Mar. 15
50 (export).
Mar. 21
50 (domestic).
Mar. 20
50 ($1.08)
Mar. 25
50 ($.90)
Mar. 31
100 (export).
The drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt with the lowest drawback amount per unit is the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the January 28 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the remainder of the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $100.50 (the January 5 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 23 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no
drawback) is zero (the February 20 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $102.50 (the January 25 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the March 21 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is $52.50 (the February 25 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). Remaining in inventory is the March 20 receipt of 50 units ($1.08 drawback/unit). Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $391.00.
(iii)
Low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period
—(A)
Method.
Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into the inventory in the established average inventory turn-over period preceding the withdrawal.
(B)
Accounting for withdrawals (for domestic shipments and for export).
Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.
(C)
Establishment of inventory turn-over period.
For purposes of this section, average inventory turn-over period is based on the rate of withdrawal from inventory and represents the time in which all of the merchandise or articles in the inventory at a given time must have been withdrawn. To establish an average of this time, at least 1 year, or three (3) turn-over periods (if inventory turns over less than 3 times per year), must be averaged. The inventory turn-over period must be that for the merchandise or articles to be identified, except that if the person using the method has more than one kind of merchandise or articles with different inventory turn-over periods, the longest average turn-over period established under this section may be used (instead of using a different inventory turn-over period for each kind of merchandise or article).
(D)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.
(iv)
Low-to-high blanket method
—(A)
Method.
Under the low-to-high blanket
method, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into inventory in the period preceding the withdrawal equal to the statutory period for export under the kind of drawback involved (e.g., 180 days under 19 U.S.C. 1313(p), 3 years under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c) and 1313(j), and 5 years otherwise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(i)). Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for 19 U.S.C. 1313(j); more than 180 days after the date of import or after the close of the manufacturing period for 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).
(B)
Accounting for withdrawals (for domestic shipments and for export).
Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.
(C)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the inventory with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $50.00 (the remainder of the January 2 receipt and the January 5 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $50.50 (the February 20 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $96.00 (the March 25 and January 25 receipts). Receipts not attributed to withdrawals for export are the January 31 (50 units at $1.03), February 25 (50 units at $1.05), March 5 (50 units at $1.06), and March 20 (50 units at $1.08) receipts. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $286.50.
(4)
Average
—(i)
General.
The average method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified on the basis of the calculation by recordkeeping of the amount of drawback that may be attributed to each unit of merchandise or articles in the inventory. In this method, the ratio of:
(A) The total units of a particular receipt of the fungible merchandise in the inventory at the time of a withdrawal to;
(B) The total units of all receipts of the fungible merchandise (including each receipt into inventory) at the time of the withdrawal;
(C) Is applied to the withdrawal, so that the withdrawal consists of a proportionate quantity of units from each particular receipt and each receipt is correspondingly decreased. Withdrawals and corresponding decreases to receipts are rounded to the nearest whole number.
(ii)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $133 (50 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit, 33 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, and 17 units from the receipt on the 5th with $0 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75
units (50 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 100 units from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal) and 25 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 50 units from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 75 units (with 50 with $1 drawback/unit and 25 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit, 25 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (50 with $2 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 75 units from the receipt on the 15th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal), 33 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 50 units remaining from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal, and 17 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 25 units remaining from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 50 units (25 with $2 drawback/unit, 17 with $1 drawback/unit, and 8 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios).
(5)
Inventory turn-over for limited purposes.
A properly established average inventory turn-over period, as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, may be used to determine:
(i) The fact and date(s) of use in manufacture or production of the imported designated merchandise and other (substituted) merchandise (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)); or
(ii) The fact and date(s) of manufacture or production of the finished articles (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and (b)).
(d)
Approval of other accounting methods.
(1) Persons proposing to use an accounting method for identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes which has not been previously approved for such use (see paragraph (c) of this section), or which includes modifications from the methods listed in paragraph (c) of this section, may seek approval by Customs of the proposed accounting method under the provisions for obtaining an administrative ruling (see part 177 of this chapter). The conditions applied and the criteria used by Customs in approving such an alternative accounting method, or a modification of one of the approved accounting methods, will be the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, as well as those in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) In order for a proposed accounting method to be approved by Customs for purposes of this section, it shall meet the following criteria:
(i) For purposes of calculations of drawback, the proposed accounting method must be either revenue neutral or favorable to the Government; and
(ii) The proposed accounting method should be:
(A) Generally consistent with commercial accounting procedures, as applicable for purposes of drawback;
(B) Consistent with inventory or material control records used in the ordinary course of business by the person proposing the method; and
(C) Easily administered by both Customs and the person proposing the method.

§ 191.15
Recordkeeping.
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records which pertain to the filing of a drawback claim or to the information contained in the records required by 19 U.S.C. 1313 in connection with the filing of a drawback claim shall be retained for 3 years after payment of such claims or longer period if required by law (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different period for different purposes).

# Subpart B—Manufacturing Drawback
§ 191.21
Direct identification drawback.
Section 313(a) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a)), provides for drawback upon the exportation, or destruction under Customs supervision, of articles which are not used in the United States prior to their exportation or destruction, and which are manufactured or produced in the United States wholly or in part with the use of particular imported, duty-paid merchandise and/
or drawback product(s). Where two or more products result, drawback shall be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative value (see § 191.2(u)) at the time of separation. Merchandise may be identified for drawback purposes under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) in the manner provided for and prescribed in § 191.14 of this part.
§ 191.22
Substitution drawback.
(a)
General.
If imported, duty-paid, merchandise and any other merchandise (whether imported or domestic) of the same kind and quality are used in the manufacture or production of articles within a period not to exceed 3 years from the receipt of the imported merchandise by the manufacturer or producer of the articles, then upon the exportation, or destruction under Customs supervision, of any such articles, without their having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction, drawback is provided for in § 313(b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)), even though none of the imported, duty-paid merchandise may have been used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles. The amount of drawback allowable cannot exceed that which would have been allowable had the merchandise used therein been the imported, duty-paid merchandise. For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38, 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.
(b)
Use by same manufacturer or producer at different factory.
Duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used at one factory of a manufacturer or producer within 3 years after the date on which the material was received by the manufacturer or producer may be designated as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced in accordance with these regulations at other factories of the same manufacturer or producer.
(c)
Designation.
A manufacturer or producer may designate any eligible imported merchandise or drawback product which it has used in manufacture or production.
(d)
Designation by successor; 19 U.S.C. 1313(s)
—(1)
General rule.
Upon compliance with the requirements in this section and under 19 U.S.C. 1313(s), a drawback successor as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may designate merchandise or drawback product used by a predecessor before the date of succession as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced by the successor after the date of succession.
(2)
Drawback successor.
A “drawback successor” is a manufacturer or producer to whom another entity (predecessor) has transferred, by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution:
(i) All or substantially all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties, and liabilities of the predecessor; or
(ii) The assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of such predecessor, provided that the value of the transferred assets and interests (realty, personalty, and intangibles, exclusive of the drawback rights) exceeds the value of such drawback rights, whether vested or contingent.
(3)
Certifications and required evidence
—(i)
Records of predecessor.
The predecessor or successor must certify that the successor is in possession of the predecessor's records which are necessary to establish the right to drawback under the law and regulations with respect to the merchandise or drawback product.
(ii)
Merchandise not otherwise designated.
The predecessor or successor must certify in an attachment to the claim, that the predecessor has not designated and will not designate, nor enable any other person to designate, such merchandise or product as the basis for drawback.
(iii)
Value of transferred property.
In instances in which assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of a predecessor are transferred, the predecessor or successor must specify, and maintain supporting records to establish, the value of the drawback rights and the value of all other transferred property.
(iv)
Review by Customs.
The written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the records and evidence provided for in paragraph (d)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section, must be retained by the appropriate party(s) for 3 years from the date of payment of the related claim and are subject to review by Customs upon request.
(e)
Multiple products
—(1)
General.
Where two or more products are produced concurrently in a substitution manufacturing operation, drawback shall be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value (see § 191.2(u)) at the time of separation.
(2)
Claims covering a manufacturing period.
Where the claim covers a manufacturing period rather than a manufacturing lot, the entire period covered by the claim is the time of separation of the products and the value per unit of product is the market value for the period (see § 191.2(u) of this part). Manufacturing periods in excess of one month may not be used without specific approval of Customs.
(3)
Recordkeeping.
Records shall be maintained showing the relative value of each product at the time of separation.
[T.D. 98-16, 63 FR 11006, Mar. 5, 1998, as amended by USCBP-2018-0029, 83 FR 65064, Dec. 18, 2018]
§ 191.23
Methods of claiming drawback.
(a)
Used in.
Drawback may be paid based on the amount of the imported or substituted merchandise used in the manufacture of the exported article, where there is no waste or the waste is valueless or unrecoverable. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is no valuable waste (see paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Appearing in.
Drawback is allowable under this method based only on the amount of imported or substituted merchandise that appears in (is contained in) the exported articles. This method may not be used if there are multiple products also necessarily and concurrently resulting from the manufacturing process.
(c)
Used in less valuable waste.
Drawback is allowable under this method based on the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture the exported or destroyed article, reduced by an amount equal to the quantity of this merchandise that the value of the waste would replace. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is valuable waste.
(d)
Abstract or schedule.
A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see § 191.8) shall state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.
(e)
Recordkeeping
—(1)
Valuable waste.
When the waste has a value and the drawback claim is not limited to the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles, as well as the market value of the resulting waste, under the used in less valuable waste method (see § 191.2(u) of this part).
(2)
If claim for waste is waived.
If claim for waste is waived, only the “appearing in” basis may be used (see paragraph (b) of this section). Waste
records need not be kept unless required to establish the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback.
[T.D. 98-16, 63 FR 11006, Mar. 5, 1998; 63 FR 15288, Mar. 31, 1998]
§ 191.24
Certificate of manufacture and delivery.
(a)
When required.
When an article or drawback product manufactured or produced under a general manufacturing drawback ruling or a specific manufacturing drawback ruling is transferred from the manufacturer or producer to another party, a certificate of manufacture and delivery shall be prepared and certified by the manufacturer.
(b)
Information required on certificate.
The following information shall be required on the certificate of manufacture and delivery executed by the manufacturer or producer:
(1) The person to whom the article or drawback product is delivered;
(2) If the article or drawback product was manufactured or produced under a general manufacturing drawback ruling, the unique computer-generated number assigned to the letter of acknowledgment for that ruling, and if the article or drawback product was manufactured or produced under a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, either the unique computer number or the T.D. number for that ruling;
(3) The quantity, kind and quality of imported, duty-paid merchandise or drawback product designated;
(4) Import entry numbers, HTSUS number for the imported merchandise to at least the 6th digit (such HTSUS number shall be from the entry summary and other entry documentation for the imported, duty-paid merchandise unless the issuer of the certificate of manufacture and delivery received the merchandise under another certificate (either of delivery or of manufacture and delivery), in which case such HTSUS number shall be from the other certificate), and applicable duty amounts;
(5) Date received at factory;
(6) Date used in manufacture;
(7) Value at factory, if applicable;
(8) Quantity of waste, if any, if applicable;
(9) Market value of any waste, if applicable;
(10) Total quantity and description of merchandise appearing in or used;
(11) Total quantity and description of articles produced;
(12) Date of manufacture or production of the articles;
(13) The quantity of articles transferred; and
(14) The person from whom the article or drawback product is delivered.
(c)
Filing of certificate.
The certificate of manufacture and delivery shall be filed with the drawback claim it supports (unless previously filed) (see § 191.51 of this part).
(d)
Effect of certificate.
A certificate of manufacture and delivery documents the delivery of articles from the manufacturer or producer to another party, identifies such articles as being those to which a potential right to drawback exists, and assigns such potential rights to the transferee (see also § 191.82 of this part).
§ 191.25
Destruction under Customs supervision.
A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain manufacturing drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 191.71 of this part relating to destruction.
§ 191.26
Recordkeeping for manufacturing drawback.
(a)
Direct identification manufacturing
—(1)
Records required.
Each manufacturer or producer under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) shall keep records to allow the verifying Customs official to trace all articles manufactured or produced for exportation or destruction with drawback, from importation, through production, to exportation or destruction. To this end, these records shall specifically establish:
(i) The date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production;
(ii) The quantity and identity of the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in or appearing in (see § 191.23) the articles manufactured or produced;
(iii) The quantity, if any, of the nondrawback merchandise used, when
these records are necessary to determine the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback product used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles or appearing in them;
(iv) The quantity and description of the articles manufactured or produced;
(v) The quantity of waste incurred, if applicable; and
(vi) That the finished articles on which drawback is claimed were exported or destroyed within 5 years after the importation of the duty-paid merchandise, without having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. (If the completed articles were commingled after manufacture, their identity may be maintained in the manner prescribed in § 191.14 of this part.)
(2)
Accounting.
The merchandise and articles to be exported or destroyed shall be accounted for in a manner which will enable the manufacturer, producer, or claimant:
(i) To determine, and the Customs official to verify, the applicable import entry, certificate of delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture and delivery associated with the claim; and
(ii) To identify with respect to that import entry, certificate of delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture and delivery, the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in manufacture or production.
(b)
Substitution manufacturing.
The records of the manufacturer or producer of articles manufactured or produced in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) shall establish the facts in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (iv) through (vi) of this section, and:
(1) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the merchandise designated (imported duty-paid, or drawback product);
(2) The quantity, identity, and specifications of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise before its use to manufacture or produce (or appearing in) the exported or destroyed articles;
(3) That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its plant, the manufacturer or producer used it in manufacturing or production and that during the same 3-year period it manufactured or produced the exported or destroyed articles; and
(4) If the designated merchandise is a chemical element that was contained in imported material that was subject to an
ad valorem
rate of duty, and a substitution drawback claim is made based on that chemical element:
(i) The duty paid on the imported material must be apportioned among its constituent components. The claim on the chemical element that is the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against the above-determined amount of pure compound.
(ii) The amount claimed as drawback based on the chemical element must be deducted from the duty paid on the imported material that may be claimed on any other drawback claim.

# Example to paragraph (b)(4):
Synthetic rutile that is shown by appropriate analysis in the entry papers to be 91.7% pure titanium dioxide is imported and dutiable at a 5%
ad valorem
duty rate. The amount of imported synthetic rutile is 30,000 pounds with an entered value of $12,000. The total duty paid is $600. Titanium in the synthetic rutile is designated as the basis for a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). The amount of titanium dioxide in the synthetic rutile is determined by converting the purity percentage (91.7%) to its decimal equivalent (.917) and multiplying the entered amount of synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds) by that decimal equivalent (.917 × 30,000 = 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide contained in the 30,000 pounds of imported synthetic rutile). The titanium, based on atomic weight, represents 59.93% of the
constituents in titanium dioxide. Multiplying that percentage, converted to its decimal equivalent, by the amount of titanium dioxide determines the titanium content of the imported synthetic rutile (.5993 × 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide = 16,486.7 pounds of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile). Therefore, up to 16,486.7 pounds of titanium is available to be designated as the basis for drawback. As the per-unit duty paid on the synthetic rutile is calculated by dividing the duty paid ($600) by the amount of imported synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds), the per-unit duty is two cents of duty per pound of the imported synthetic rutile ($600 ÷ 30,000 = $0.02). The duty on the titanium is calculated by multiplying the amount of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile by two cents of duty per pound (16,486.7 × $0.02 = $329.73 duty apportioned to the titanium). The product is then multiplied by 99% to determine the maximum amount of drawback available ($329.73 × .99 = $326.44). If an exported titanium alloy ingot weighs 17,000 pounds, in which 16,000 pounds of titanium was used to make the ingot, drawback is determined by multiplying the duty per pound ($0.02) by the weight of the titanium contained in the ingot (16,000 pounds) to calculate the duty available for drawback ($0.02 × 16,000 = $320.00). Because only 99% of the duty can be claimed, drawback is determined by multiplying this available duty amount by 99% (.99 × $320.00 = $316.80). As the oxygen content of the titanium dioxide is 45% of the synthetic rutile, if oxygen is the designated merchandise on another drawback claim, 45% of the duty claimed on the synthetic rutile would be available for drawback based on the substitution of oxygen.
(c)
Valuable waste records.
When waste has a value and the manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity and market value of the waste incurred (see § 191.2(u) of this part). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b), respectively, shall be based on the quantity of merchandise actually used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the quantity of merchandise actually used the amount of merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.
(d)
Purchase of manufactured articles for exportation.
Where the claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer and exports them, the claimant shall file the related certificate of manufacture and delivery as part of the claim (see § 191.51(a)(1) of this part).
(e)
Multiple claimants
—(1)
General.
Multiple claimants may file for drawback with respect to the same export (for example, if an automobile is exported, where different parts of the automobile have been produced by different manufacturers under drawback conditions and the exporter waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturers under § 191.82 of this part).
(2)
Procedures
—(i)
Submission of letter.
Each drawback claimant shall file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the component article on the export bill of lading to which each claim will relate. Each letter shall show the name of the claimant and bear a statement that the claim shall be limited to its respective component article. The exporter shall endorse the letters, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants.
(ii)
Blanket waivers and assignments of drawback rights.
Exporters may waive and assign their drawback rights for all, or any portion, of their exportations with respect to a particular commodity for a given period to a drawback claimant.
(iii)
Use of export summary procedure.
If the parties elect to use the export summary procedure (§ 191.73 of this part) each drawback claimant shall complete a chronological summary of exports for the respective component product to which each claim will relate. Each claimant shall identify in the chronological summary the name of the other claimant(s) and the component product for which each will independently claim drawback, if known at the time the drawback claim is filed. The exporter shall endorse the summaries, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants. Each claimant shall have on file and
make available to Customs upon request, the endorsement from the exporter assigning the right to claim drawback.
(f)

—(1)
Claimant required to calculate drawback.
Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be 99 percent of the import duties eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 191.52(c).
(2)
Merchandise processing fee apportionment calculation.
Where a drawback claimant seeks unused merchandise drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), or drawback for substitution of finished petroleum derivatives pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)(2)(A)(iii) or (iv), for a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that merchandise that provides the basis for drawback when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:
(i)
Relative value ratio for each line item.
The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The resulting value forms the relative value ratio.
(ii)
Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item.
To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.
(iii)
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item.
The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.
(iv)
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise.
To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).

# Example 1:
Line item 1—5,000 articles valued at $10 each total $50,000
Line item 2—6,000 articles valued at $15 each total $90,000
Line item 3—10,000 articles valued at $20 each total $200,000
Total units = 21,000
Total value = $340,000
Merchandise processing fee = $485 (for purposes of this example, the fee cap of $485, as per 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(B)(i), is applicable)
Line item relative value ratios.
The relative value ratio for line item 1 is calculated by dividing the value of that line item by the total value ($50,000 ÷ 340,000 = .1470). The relative value ratio for line item 2 is .2647. The relative value ratio for line item 3 is .5882.
Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item.
The amount of fee attributable to each line item is calculated by multiplying $485 by the applicable relative value ratio. The amount of the $485 fee attributable to line item 1 is $71.295 (.1470 × $485 = $71.295). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $128.3795 (.2647 × $485 = $128.3795). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $285.277 (.5882 × $485 = $285.277).
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item.
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 1 is $70.5821 ÷ (.99 × $71.295). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $127.0957 (.99 × $128.3795). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 3 is $282.4242 (.99 × $285.277).
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise.
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise is calculated by dividing the amount of fee eligible for drawback for the line item by the number of units in the line item. For line item 1, the amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0141 ($70.5821 ÷ 5,000 = $.0141). If 1,000 widgets form the basis of a claim for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), the total amount of drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $14.10 (1,000 × .0141 = $14.10). For line item 2, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0212 ($127.0957 ÷ 6,000 = $.0212). For line item 3, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0282 ($282.4242 ÷ 10,000 = $.0282).

# Example 2:
This example illustrates the treatment of dutiable merchandise that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee and duty-free merchandise that is subject to the merchandise processing fee.
Line item 1—700 meters of printed cloth valued at $10 per meter (total value $7,000) that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee under 19 U.S.C. 58c(b)(8)(B)(iii)
Line item 2—15,000 articles valued at $100 each (total value $1,500,000)
Line item 3—10,000 duty-free articles valued at $50 each (total value $500,000)
The relative value ratios are calculated using line items 2 and 3 only, as there is no merchandise processing fee imposed by reason of importation on line item 1.
Line item 2—1,500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .75 (line items 2 and 3 form the total value of the merchandise subject to the merchandise processing fee).
Line item 3—500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .25.
If the total merchandise processing fee paid was $485, the amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $363.75 (.75 × $485 = $363.75). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $121.25 (.25 × $485 = $121.25).
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $360.1125 (.99 × $363.75). The amount of fee eligible for line item 3 is $120.0375 (.99 × $121.25).
The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 2 is $.0240 ($360.1125 ÷ 15,000 = $.0240). The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 3 is $.0120 ($120.0375 ÷ 10,000 = $.0120).
If 1,000 units of line item 2 were exported, the drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $24.00 ($.0240 × 1,000 = $24.00).
(c)
HTSUS number(s) or Schedule B commodity number(s) of imports and exports
—(1)
General.
Drawback claimants are required to provide, on all drawback claims they submit, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) number(s) for the designated imported merchandise and the HTSUS number(s) or the Schedule B commodity number(s) for the exported article or articles.

# Subpart G—Exportation and Destruction
§ 191.71
Drawback on articles destroyed under Customs supervision.
(a)
Procedure.
At least 7 working days before the intended date of destruction of merchandise or articles upon which
drawback is intended to be claimed, a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on Customs Form 7553 shall be filed by the claimant with the Customs port where the destruction is to take place, giving notification of the date and specific location where the destruction is to occur. Within 4 working days after receipt of the Customs Form 7553, Customs shall advise the filer in writing of its determination to witness or not to witness the destruction. If the filer of the notice is not so notified within 4 working days, the merchandise may be destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been destroyed under Customs supervision. Unless Customs determines to witness the destruction, the destruction of the articles following timely notification on Customs Form 7553 shall be deemed to have occurred under Customs supervision. If Customs attends the destruction, it must certify the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback.
(b)
Evidence of destruction.
When Customs does not attend the destruction, the claimant must submit evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback. The evidence must be issued by a disinterested third party (for example, a landfill operator). The type of evidence depends on the method and place of destruction, but must establish that the merchandise was, in fact, destroyed within the meaning of “destruction” in § 191.2(g) (
i.e.,
that no articles of commercial value remained after destruction).
(c)
Completion of drawback entry.
After destruction, the claimant must provide the Customs Form 7553, certified by the Customs official witnessing the destruction in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to Customs as part of the completed drawback claim based on the destruction (see § 191.51(a) of this part). If Customs has not attended the destruction, the claimant must provide the evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved Customs Form 7553, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, as part of the completed drawback claim based on the destruction (see § 191.51(a) of this part).

# Subpart H—Liquidation and Protest of Drawback Entries
§ 191.81
Liquidation.
(a)
Time of liquidation.
Drawback entries may be liquidated after:
(1) Liquidation of the designated import entry or entries becomes final pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or
(2) Deposit of estimated duties on the imported merchandise and before liquidation of the designated import entry or entries.
(b)
Claims based on estimated duties.
(1) Drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on estimated duties if one or more of the designated import entries have not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) (
see
also § 173.4(c) of this chapter), only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant must, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.
(2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, will:
(i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or
(ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to have been paid as estimated duties on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.
(c)
Claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties
—(1)
General.
Subject to the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on voluntary tenders of the unpaid amount of lawful ordinary customs duties or any other payment of lawful ordinary customs duties for an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption (
see
§ 191.3(a)(1)(iii)), provided that:
(i) The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption;
(ii) Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or payment; and
(iii) Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically identified import entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption is designated has not become final.
(2)
Written request and waiver.
Drawback may be paid on claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.
(d)
Claims based on liquidated duties.
Drawback will be based on the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties, and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).
(e)
Liquidation procedure.
(1)
General.
When the drawback claim has been
completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and exportation (or destruction) of the merchandise or articles has been established, CBP will determine drawback due on the basis of the complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information. Notice of liquidation will be given electronically as provided in §§ 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3) of this chapter.

# Subpart S—Drawback Compliance Program
§ 191.191
Purpose.
This subpart sets forth the requirements for the Customs drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest, including Customs brokers, may participate after being certified by Customs. Participation in the program is voluntary. Under the program, Customs is required to inform potential drawback claimants and related parties clearly about their rights and obligations under the drawback law and regulations. Reduced penalties and/or warning letters may be issued once a party has been certified for the program, and is in general compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements thereof.
§ 191.192
Certification for compliance program.

General.
A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the core requirements established under the program, or after negotiating an alternative drawback compliance program suited to the needs of both the party and Customs. Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program, the type of drawback claims filed, and the volume of claims filed. Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.
(b)
Core requirements of program.
In order to be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program or negotiated alternative drawback compliance program, the party must be able to demonstrate that it:

To do so, a Customs broker who is employed to assist a claimant in filing for drawback must be able to demonstrate, for and on behalf of such claimant, conformity with the core requirements of the drawback compliance program as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The broker shall ensure that the claimant has the necessary documentation and records to support the drawback compliance program established on its behalf, and that claims to be filed under the program are reviewed by the broker for accuracy and completeness.

removal in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Effect of removal.
The removal of certification will be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification will be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.
(f)
Appeal of certification denial or removal
—(1)
Appeal of certification denial.
A party may challenge a denial of an application for certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program by filing a written appeal, within 30 days of issuance of the notice of denial, with the applicable drawback office.

i. The concentrate is blended with fresh orange juice (single strength juice); or
ii. The concentrate is blended with essential oils, flavoring components, and water; or
iii. The concentrate is blended with water and is heat treated to reduce the enzymatic activity and the number of viable microorganisms.
2. Frozen concentrated orange juice. Concentrated orange juice for manufacturing is reduced to a desired degree Brix of not less than 41.8° Brix by the following optional blending processes:
i. The concentrate is blended with fresh orange juice (single strength juice); or
ii. The concentrate is blended with essential oils and flavoring components and water.
3. Bulk concentrated orange juice. Concentrated orange juice for manufacturing is blended with essential oils and flavoring components which would enable another processor such as a dairy to prepare finished frozen concentrated orange juice or orange juice from concentrate by merely adding water to the (intermediate) bulk concentrated orange juice.

# E. Multiple Products, Waste, Loss or Gain
Not applicable.

# F. Tradeoff
The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

# G. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise
2
used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles produced.”
3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced
3
the exported articles.
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.

# C. Exported Articles on Which Drawback Will Be Claimed
See the General Instructions, I.A.7., for this general drawback ruling. Each article to be exported must be named. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name, there must be a statement as to what the product is, e.g., a herbicide.

# D. General Statement
The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).

# E. Process of Manufacture or Production
Heated crude oil is charged to an atmospheric distillation tower where it is subjected to fractionation. The charge to the distillation tower consists of a single crude oil, or of commingled crudes which are fed to the tower simultaneously or after blending in a tank. During fractionation, components of different boiling ranges are separated.

# F. Multiple Products

# 1. Relative Values
Fractionation results in 17 products. In order to insure proper distribution of drawback to each of these products, the manufacturer or producer agrees to record the relative values as the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract is to be treated at the time of separation. The value per unit of each product shall be the average market value for the abstract period.

# 2. Producibility
The manufacturer or producer can vary the proportionate quantity of each product. The manufacturer or producer understands that drawback is payable on exported products only to the extent that these products could have been produced from the designated merchandise. The records of the manufacturer or producer will show that all of the products exported for which drawback will be claimed under this general manufacturing drawback
ruling could have been produced concurrently on a practical operating basis from the designated merchandise.
The manufacturer or producer agrees to establish the amount to be designated by reference to the Industry Standards of Potential Production published in T.D. 66-16.
2
2
A manufacturer who proposes to use standards other than those in T.D. 66-16 must state the proposed standards and provide sufficient information to the Customs Service in order for those proposed standards to be verified in accordance with T.D. 84-49.
There are no valuable wastes as a result of the processing.

# G. Loss or Gain
Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.

# H. Tradeoff
The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise designated;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise used to produce the exported articles.
3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at its refinery, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced the exported articles.
4(a). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use a 28-31 day period (monthly) abstract period for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling, or
(b). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use an abstract period (not to exceed 1 year) for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer certifies that if it were to file abstracts covering each manufacturing period of not less than 28 days and not more than 31 days (monthly) within the longer period, in no such monthly abstract would the quantity of designated merchandise exceed, for the same class of designated merchandise, the material introduced into the manufacturing process during that monthly period. (Select (a) or (b), and state which is selected in the application, and, if (b) is selected, specify the length of the particular abstract period chosen (not to exceed 1 year (see General Instruction I.A.7.)).)
5. On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.
6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance. Records will be kept in accordance with T.D. 84-49, as amended by T.D. 95-61.

# J. Residual Rights
It is understood that the refiner can reserve as the basis for future payment the right to drawback only on the number of barrels of raw material computed by subtracting from Line E the larger of Lines A or B, of a given Exhibit E. It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights shall be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer shall follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights shall be filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.

# K. Inventory Procedures
The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories,
production and disposals from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.
The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED.

# L. Basis of Claim for Drawback
The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of any one type and class of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry shall not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material of the same type and class which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.

# M. Agreements
The manufacturer or producer specifically agrees that it will:
1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;
2. Open its refinery and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;
4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;
5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and
6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

Piece goods.
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
The piece goods used in manufacture will be the same kind and quality as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods of the same kind and quality as follows:
1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;
2. A tolerance of 4% in the aggregate thread count per square inch so that the piece goods used in manufacture will have an aggregate thread count within 4%, more or less of the aggregate thread count of the imported piece goods which will be designated. In each case, the average yarn number of the domestic piece goods will be the same or greater than the average yarn number of the imported piece goods designated, and in each case, the substitution and tolerance will be employed only within the same family of fabrics,
i.e.,
print cloth for print cloth, gingham for gingham, greige for greige, dyed for dyed, bleached for bleached, etc. The piece goods used in manufacture of the exported articles will be designated as containing the identical percentage of identical fibers as the piece goods designated as the basis for allowance of drawback; for example, piece goods containing 65% cotton and 35% dacron will be designated against the use of piece goods shown to contain 65% cotton and 35% dacron. The actual fiber composition may vary slightly from that described on the invoice or other acceptance of the fabric as having the composition described on documents in accordance with trade practices. The substituted piece goods used in the manufacture of articles for exportation with drawback will be so similar in quality to the imported piece goods designated for the basis of allowance of drawback, that the piece goods used, if imported, would have been subject to the same or greater amount of duty as was paid on the imported designated piece goods. Differences in value resulting from factors other than quality, as for example, price fluctuations, will not preclude an allowance of drawback.

# B. Exported Articles on Which Drawback Will Be Claimed
Finished piece goods.

# C. General Statement
The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s. 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).

# D. Process of Manufacture or Production
Piece goods are subject to any one of the following finishing productions:
1. Bleaching,
2. Mercerizing,
3. Dyeing,
4. Printing,
5. A combination of the above, or
6. Any additional finishing processes.

# E. Multiple Products
Not applicable.

# F. Waste
Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the quantity of rag waste, if any, and its value. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the piece goods put into the finishing processes.

# G. Shrinkage, Gain, and Spoilage
Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain and spoilage will also be kept.

# H. Tradeoff
The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise
2
used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles produced.”
3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced
3
the exported articles.
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# J. Inventory Procedures
The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures And Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.

# K. Basis of Claim for Drawback
Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of piece goods, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used to produce the exported articles less the amount of piece goods which the value of the waste would replace.

# L. General Requirements
The manufacturer or producer will:
1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;
2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;
4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9)
or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;
5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and
6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.

# XI. General Manufacturing Drawback Ruling under 19 U.S.C. 1313(
b

# ) for Raw Sugar (T.D. 83-59)
Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) upon the exportation of hard or soft refined sugars and sirups manufactured from raw sugar, subject to the following special requirements:
A. The drawback allowance shall not exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on a quantity of raw sugar designated by the refiner which contains a quantity of sucrose not in excess of the quantity required to manufacture the exported sugar or sirup, ascertained as provided in this general rule.
B. The refined sugars and sirups shall have been manufactured with the use of duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic sugar, or combinations thereof, within 3 years after the date on which designated sugar was received by the refiner, and shall have been exported within 5 years from the date of importation of the designated sugar.
C. All granulated sugar testing by the polariscope 99.5° and over shall be deemed hard refined sugar. All refined sugar testing by the polariscope less than 99.5° shall be deemed soft refined sugar. All “blackstrap,” “unfiltered sirup,” and “final molasses” shall be deemed sirup.
D. The imported duty-paid sugar selected by the refiner as the basis for the drawback claim (designated sugar) shall be of the same kind and quality as that used in the manufacture of the exported refined sugar or sirup and shall have been used within 3 years after the date on which it was received by the refiner. Duty-paid sugar which has been used at a plant of a refiner within 3 years after the date on which it was received by such refiner may be designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on refined sugars or sirups manufactured at another plant of the same refiner.
E. For the purpose of distributing the drawback, relative values shall be established between hard refined (granulated) sugar, soft refined (various grades) sugar, and sirups at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract shall be deemed the time of separation of the sugars and sirups covered by such abstract.
F. The sucrose allowance per pound on hard refined (granulated) sugar established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to hard refined sugar commercially known as loaf, cut loaf, cube, pressed, crushed, or powdered sugar manufactured from the granulated sugar covered by the abstract.
G. The sucrose allowance per gallon on sirup established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to sirup further advanced in value by filtration or otherwise, unless such sirup is the subject of a special manufacturing drawback ruling.
H.

# ) for Steel (T.D. 81-74)
A. Same Kind and Quality (Parallel Columns)
Imported Merchandise or Drawback Products
1
to be Designated as the Basis for Drawback on the Exported Products
Duty-Paid, Duty-Free or Domestic Merchandise of the Same Kind and Quality as that Designated which will be Used in the Production of the Exported Products.
Steel of one general class, e.g., an ingot, falling within one SAE, AISI, or ASTM
2
specification and, if the specification contains one or more grades, falling within one grade of the specification
Steel of the same general class, specification, and grade as the steel in the column immediately to the left hereof.
1
Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
2
Standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), or the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).
1. The duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used instead of the imported, duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be interchangeable for manufacturing purposes with the duty-paid steel. To be interchangeable a steel must be able to be used in place of the substituted steel without any additional processing step in the manufacture of the article on which drawback is to be claimed.
2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by “price extra”, and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 5,
infra,
insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.
3. The duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be so similar in quality to the steel used to manufacture the articles on which drawback will be claimed that the steel so used, if imported, would be classifiable in the same tariff subheading number and at the same rate of duty as the duty-paid imported steel.
4. Any fluctuation in market value caused by a factor other than quality does not affect drawback.
5. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the parallel columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within a SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification) is considered to meet this criterion for “same kind and quality.”

# B. Exported Articles on Which Drawback Will Be Claimed
The exported articles will have been manufactured in the United States using steels described in the parallel columns above.

# C. General Statement
The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account.

Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of steel appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), the quantity, and the disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.

# G. Loss or Gain
The manufacturer or producer will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the steel caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.

# H. Tradeoff
The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise
3
used to produce the exported articles;
3
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles produced.”
3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced
4
the exported articles.
4
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Entry Process and Duty Refunds, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229.
Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, §§ 1313 (a)
(b), and part 191 of the CBP Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

# NAME AND ADDRESS AND IRS NUMBER (WITH SUFFIX) OF APPLICANT
(Section 191.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.7 of the CBP Regulations. Customs will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (see § 191.8(a)).)

# LOCATION OF FACTORY
(Give the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. If the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, so state and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)

# PERSONS WHO WILL SIGN DRAWBACK DOCUMENTS
(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 191.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a Customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A Customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed Customs broker. This heading should be changed to Names of Partners or Proprietor in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (see footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)

# CBP OFFICE WHERE DRAWBACK CLAIMS WILL BE FILED
(The four offices where drawback claims can be filed are located at: New York, NY; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA)
(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)

# GENERAL STATEMENT
(The following questions must be answered:)
1. Who will be the importer of the designated merchandise?
(If the applicant will not always be the importer of the designated merchandise, does the applicant understand its obligations to obtain the appropriate certificates of delivery (19 CFR 191.10), certificates of manufacture and delivery (19 CFR 191.24), or both?)
2. Will an agent be used to process the designated or the substituted merchandise into articles?
(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) and § 191.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see § 191.7 and Appendix A) or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8 and this Appendix B).)
3. Will the applicant be the exporter?
(If the applicant will not be the exporter in every case but will be the claimant, the manufacturer must state that it will reserve the right to claim drawback with the knowledge and written consent of the exporter (19 CFR 191.82).)
(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Customs office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)

TO BE DESIGNATED AS THE BASIS FOR DRAWBACK ON THE EXPORTED PRODUCTS
DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC MERCHANDISE OF THE SAME KIND AND QUALITY AS THAT DESIGNATED WHICH WILL BE USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE EXPORTED PRODUCTS.

Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under section 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.)
(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the “same kind and quality” of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)
The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.
Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.
(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the “same kind and quality”. “Same kind and quality” does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (“same kind”) and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (“same quality”). In order to enable Customs to rule on “same kind and quality”, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)
(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same kind and quality” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind
of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the “same kind and quality” determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)
(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)
(The descriptions of the “same kind and quality” merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)
(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)

# MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

# 1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)
Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)
(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or
1/5
. The relative value of B is
2/15
and of product C is
2/3
, calculated in the same manner. This means that
1/5
of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A,
2/15
to product B, and
2/3
to product C.)
(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)

# 2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)
(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# TRADEOFF
(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provision has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or
quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise we designate;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise
2
we used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at our factory, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, we produced
3
the exported articles.
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)
RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
RECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
BILLS OF MATERIALS
MANUFACTURING RECORDS
WASTE RECORDS
RECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC MERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME KIND AND QUALITY WITHIN 3 YEARS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS
SHIPPING RECORDS
(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g. within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)
(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)
(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)
(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)
(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated,
which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base his claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule follows:)
We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “Appearing In” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

# PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 1313(a)

# IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR DRAWBACK PRODUCTS USED UNDER 1313(a)
(List the imported merchandise or drawback products)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)
(If the merchandise used under § 1313(a) is not also used under § 1313(b), the sections entitled PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION, BY-PRODUCTS, LOSS OR GAIN, and STOCK IN PROCESS should be included here to cover merchandise used under § 1313(a). However, if the merchandise used under § 1313(a) is also used under § 1313(b) these sections need not be repeated unless they differ in some way from the § 1313(b) descriptions.)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise, and
2. The quantity of imported merchandise
4
we used in producing the exported articles

If claims are to be made on an “appearing In” basis, the remainder of the sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(This section must be completed separately from that set forth under the § 1313(b) portion of your application. The legal requirements under § 1313(a) differ from those under § 1313(b).) (Describe your inventory procedures and state how you will identify the imported merchandise from the time it is received at your factory until it is incorporated in the articles to be exported. Also describe how you will identify the finished articles from the time of manufacture until shipment.)

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(See section with this title for procedures under § 1313(b). Either repeat the same basis of claim or use a different basis of claim, as described above, specifically for drawback claimed under § 1313(a).)

Drawback products are those produced in the United States in accordance with the drawback law and regulations. Such products have “dual status” under § 1313(b). They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.
(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the “same kind and quality” of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)
The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in
quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.
Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.
(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the “same kind and quality”. “Same kind and quality” does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (“same kind”) and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (“same quality”). In order to enable Customs to rule on “same kind and quality”, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)
(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same kind and quality” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the “same kind and quality” determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)
(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling review process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)
(The descriptions of the “same kind and quality” merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)
(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)

# MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

# 1. Relative Values
(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product or by-product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)
(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the same operation. For instance, the refining of
flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)
(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or
1/5
. The relative value of B is
2/15
and of product C is
2/3
, calculated in the same manner. This means that
1/5
of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A,
2/15
to product B, and
2/3
to product C.)
(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)

# 2. Producibility
(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)
(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles less valuable waste, state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in”
or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# TRADEOFF
(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provisions has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise we designate;
2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise
2
we used to produce the exported articles;
2
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at our factory, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, we produced
3
the exported articles;
3
The date of production is the date an article is completed.
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)
RECEIPT AND STORAGE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
RECORDS OF USE OF DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
BILLS OF MATERIALS
MANUFACTURING RECORDS
WASTE RECORDS
RECORDS OF USE OF DUTY-PAID, DUTY-FREE OR DOMESTIC
MERCHANDISE OF THE REQUIRED SAME KIND AND QUALITY
WITHIN 3 YEARS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESIGNATED MERCHANDISE
FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS
SHIPPING RECORDS
(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)
(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it
does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)
(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)
(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)
(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base his claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)
We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “Appearing In” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

# COMPANY LETTERHEAD (Optional)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229.
Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(d), and part 191 of the Customs Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

# NAME AND ADDRESS AND IRS NUMBER (WITH SUFFIX) OF APPLICANT
(Section 191.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.7 of the CBP Regulations. Customs will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (see § 191.8(a)).)

# LOCATION OF FACTORY
(Give the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. If the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, so state and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)

# PERSONS WHO WILL SIGN DRAWBACK DOCUMENTS
(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 191.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a Customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A Customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed Customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (see footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).

# CBP OFFICE WHERE DRAWBACK CLAIMS WILL BE FILED
(The four offices where drawback claims can be filed are located at: New York, NY; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA)
(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)

# GENERAL STATEMENT
(The exact material placed under this heading in individual cases will vary, but it should include such information as the type of business in which the manufacturer is engaged, whether the manufacturer is manufacturing for his own account or is performing the operation on a toll basis (including commission or conversion basis) for the account of others, whether the manufacturer is a direct exporter of his products or sells or delivers them to others for export, and whether drawback will be claimed by the manufacturer or by others.)
(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 191.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see § 191.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8 and this Appendix B).)
(Regarding drawback operations conducted under § 1313(d), the data may describe the flavoring extracts, medicinal, or toilet preparations (including perfumery) manufactured with the use of domestic tax-paid alcohol; and where such alcohol is obtained or purchased.)
(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Drawback office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)

# TAX-PAID MATERIAL USED UNDER SECTION 1313(d)
(Describe or list the tax-paid material)

# EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED
(Name each article to be exported)

# PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION
(Drawback under § 1313(d) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. “Manufacture or production” is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(d), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. Describe how the tax-paid material is processed into the export article.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.) (If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation, does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity
of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# STOCK IN PROCESS
(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).
(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that the domestic tax-paid alcohol is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the domestic tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of domestic tax-paid alcohol, and
2. The quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol
1
we used in producing the exported articles.
1
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the tax has been paid on the domestic alcohol. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(d) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas should be included in your discussion:)
RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDS
MANUFACTURING RECORDS
FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)
(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of flavoring extracts and medicinal or toilet preparation (including perfumery).)
(For example, if 100 gallons of alcohol, valued at $1.00 per gallon, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 100% of the tax paid on the 100 gallons of domestic alcohol used to produce the exported articles.)
The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the
merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 gallons of domestic alcohol which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 gallons used in as set forth previously.)
(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of domestic tax-paid alcohol. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the quantity of tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the exported articles, reduced by the quantity of such alcohol which the value of the waste would replace.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 gallons of waste had a value of $.50 per gallon, then the 10 gallons of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 gallons of the tax-paid alcohol. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 gallons of the alcohol used, and drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on 95 gallons of alcohol rather than on the 100 gallons “Used In” or the 90 gallons “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract.

# COMPANY LETTERHEAD (Optional)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20229.
Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(g), and part 191 of the Customs Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

# NAME AND ADDRESS AND IRS NUMBER (WITH SUFFIX) OF APPLICANT
(Section 191.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.7 of the CBP Regulations. Customs will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (see § 191.8(a).)

# LOCATION OF FACTORY OR SHIPYARD
(Give the address of the factory(s) or shipyard(s) at which the construction and equipment will take place. If the factory or shipyard is a different legal entity from the applicant, so state and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)

# PERSONS WHO WILL SIGN DRAWBACK DOCUMENTS
(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 191.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a Customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A Customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed Customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (see footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)

# CBP OFFICE WHERE DRAWBACK CLAIMS WILL BE FILED
(The four offices where drawback claims can be filed are located at: New York, NY; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA)
(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)

# GENERAL STATEMENT
(The following questions must be answered:
1. Who will be the importer of the merchandise?
(If the applicant will not always be the importer, does the applicant understand its obligations to obtain the appropriate certificates of delivery (19 CFR 191.10), certificates of manufacture and delivery (19 CFR 191.24), or both?)
2. Who is the manufacturer?
(Is the applicant constructing and equipping for his own account or merely performing the operation on a toll basis for others?)
(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 191.9, as applicable, and that its
agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see § 191.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8 and this Appendix B).)
3. Will the applicant be the drawback claimant?
(State how the vessel will qualify for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(g). Who is the foreign person or government for whom the vessel is being made or equipped?)
(There shall be included under this heading the following statement:
We are particularly aware of the terms of § 191.76(a)(1) of and subpart M of part 191 of the Customs Regulations, and shall comply with these sections where appropriate.)
(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Drawback office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)

# IMPORTED MERCHANDISE OR DRAWBACK PRODUCTS USED
(Describe the imported merchandise or drawback products)

# ARTICLES CONSTRUCTED AND EQUIPPED FOR EXPORT
(Name the vessel or vessels to be made with imported merchandise or drawback products)

# PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT
(What is required here is a clear, concise description of the process of construction and equipment involved. The description should also trace the flow of materials through the manufacturing process for the purpose of establishing physical identification of the imported merchandise or drawback products and of the articles resulting from the processing.)

# WASTE
(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)
(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)
(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)
(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)
(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)

# LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)
(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)

# PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED
We will maintain records to establish:
1. That the exported article on which drawback is claimed was constructed and equipped with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of imported material; and
2. The quantity of imported merchandise
1
we used in producing the exported article.
1
If claims are to be made on an “appearing in” basis, the remainder of this sentence should read “appearing in the exported articles we produce.”
We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business
hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

# INVENTORY PROCEDURES
(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313 and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following should be included in your discussion:)
RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDS
CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT RECORDS
FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS
SHIPPING RECORDS

# BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK
(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)
(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported article.)
(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of imported material used in constructing and equipping the exported articles.)
(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material which appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)
(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of imported material which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)
(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported product, reduced by the quantity of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)
(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the imported material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)
(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)
(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)
(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)
(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base his claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)
We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.
(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)
We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
(Neither the “Appearing In” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

# Source:
T.D. 99-57, 64 FR 40987, July 28, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 192.11
Description of the AES.
The Automated Export System (AES) is the information system for collecting Electronic Export Information (EEI) from persons exporting goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; between Puerto Rico and the United States; and to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the United States or Puerto Rico. Pursuant to the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR), all commodity export information for which EEI is required must be filed through the AES. This system is the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system used for purposes of filing EEI as required by § 192.14. AES is also the system by which certain sea carriers may report required outbound vessel information electronically (
see,
§§ 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and application procedures are found in the General Requirements section of the FTR, codified at 15 CFR part 30, subpart A. The Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR part 30, subpart A) provides that exporters may choose to submit export information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options available.
Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies before it can be used by AES participants.

Criteria for denial of applications requesting AES post-departure (Option 4) filing status; appeal procedures.
(a)
Approval process.
Applications for the option of filing export commodity information electronically through AES after the vessel has departed (Option 4 filing status) must be unanimously approved by Customs, Census and other participating government agencies. Disapproval by one of the participating agencies will cause rejection of the application.
(b)
Grounds for denial.
Customs may deny a participant's application for any of the following reasons:
(1) The applicant is not an exporter, as defined in the Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.7(d));
(2) The applicant has a history of non-compliance with export regulations (e.g., exporter has a history of late electronic submission of commodity records or a record of non-submission of required export documentation);
(3) The applicant has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency; or
(4) The applicant has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.
(c)
Notice of denial; appeal procedures.
Applicants will be notified of approval or denial in writing by Census. (Applicants whose applications are denied by other agencies must contact those agencies for their specific appeal procedures.) Applicants whose applications are denied by Customs will be provided with the specific reason(s) for non-selection. Applicants may challenge Customs decision by following the appeal procedure provided at § 192.13(b).
§ 192.13
Revocation of participants' AES post-departure (Option 4) filing privileges; appeal procedures.
(a)
Reasons for revocation.
Customs may revoke Option 4 privileges of participants for the following reasons:
(1) The exporter has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact;
(2) The exporter submitting the “Letter of Intent” is indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency;
(3) The exporter fails to substantially comply with export regulations; or
(4) Continued participation in AES as an Option 4 filer would pose a threat to national security, such that continued participation in Option 4 should be terminated.
(b)
Notice of revocation; appeal procedures.
When Customs has decided to revoke a participant's Option 4 filing privileges, the participant will be notified in writing of the reason(s) for the decision. The participant may challenge Customs decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the notice of decision. Except as stated elsewhere in this paragraph, the revocation will become effective when the participant has either exhausted all appeal proceedings or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation if no appeal is filed. However, in cases of intentional violations of any Customs law on the part of the program participant or when required by the national security, revocations will become effective immediately upon notification. Appeals should be addressed to the Director, Outbound Programs, U.S. Customs, Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Room 5.4c, Washington, DC 20229. Customs will issue a written decision or notice of extension to the participant within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. If a notice of extension is forwarded, the applicant will be provided with the reason(s) for extension of this time period and an expected date of decision. Participants who have had their Option 4 filing
privileges revoked and applicants not selected to participate in Option 4 of AES may not reapply for this filing status for one year following written notification of rejection or revocation.
§ 192.14
Electronic information for outward cargo required in advance of departure.
(a)
General requirement.
Pursuant to section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2071 note), for any commercial cargo that is to be exported from the United States by vessel, aircraft, rail, or truck, unless exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI), the USPPI's authorized agent, or the authorized filing agent of the Foreign Principal Party in Interest (FPPI) must electronically transmit for receipt by CBP, no later than the time period specified in paragraph (b) of this section, certain Electronic Export Information (EEI), as enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section. Specifically, to effect the advance electronic transmission of the required cargo information to CBP, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must use a CBP-approved electronic data interchange system (currently, the Automated Export System (AES)).
(b)
Transmission of data
—(1)
Time for transmission of EEI.
The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must electronically transmit the EEI required by § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.6) and have received the AES Internal Transaction Number (ITN) (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for outbound cargo no later than the time period specified as follows:
(i) For vessel cargo, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 24 hours prior to loading cargo on the vessel at the U.S. port of lading;
(ii) For air cargo, including cargo being transported by air express couriers, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 2 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the aircraft from the U.S. port of export;
(iii) For truck cargo, including cargo departing by express consignment courier, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 1 hour prior to the arrival of the truck at the border;
(iv) For rail cargo, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 2 hours prior to the arrival of the train at the border;
(v) For shipments of used self-propelled vehicles as defined in § 192.1, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier at least 72 hours prior to export; and
(vi) For cargo shipped by pipeline, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent should refer to § 30.4 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.4, 30.46) for applicable time frames for the transmission of EEI.
(2)
Applicability of time frames.
The time periods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for reporting required EEI to CBP for outward vessel, air, truck, or rail cargo only apply to shipments without an export license, license exemption, or license exception that require full predeparture reporting of shipment data, in order to comply with the advance cargo information filing requirements under section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended. Requirements placed on exports controlled by other government agencies will remain in force unless changed by the agency having the regulatory authority to do so. CBP will also continue to require 72-hour advance notice for used vehicle exports pursuant to § 192.2(c)(1) and
(c)(2)(i). The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent should refer to the relevant titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for pre-filing requirements of other government agencies. In particular, for the advance reporting requirements for exports of U.S. Munitions List items, see the U.S. Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
(3)
System verification of data acceptance or rejection.
Once the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent has transmitted the EEI required under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and AES has received and accepted this data, AES will generate and transmit to the party that filed the EEI a confirmation number, the Internal Transaction Number (ITN), assigned to that shipment confirming acceptance of the EEI transmission. When the submission is not accepted, a rejection message will be transmitted to the filer.
(c)
EEI required
—(1)
Commodity data.
The commodity data elements that are required to be reported electronically through the approved system are found in § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.6).
(2)
Transportation data.
The following transportation data elements are also required to be reported electronically through the approved system. These data elements are also found in § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (30 CFR 30.6):
(i) Method of transportation (the method of transportation is defined as that by which the goods are exported or shipped (vessel, air, rail, or truck));
(ii) Carrier identification (for vessel, rail and truck shipments, the unique carrier identifier is the 4-character Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC); for aircraft, the carrier identifier is the 2- or 3-character International Air Transport Association (IATA) code);
(iii) Conveyance name (the conveyance name is the name of the carrier; for sea carriers, this is the name of the vessel; for others, the carrier name);
(iv) Country of ultimate destination (this is the country as known to the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent at the time of exportation, where the cargo is to be consumed or further processed or manufactured; this country would be identified by the 2-character International Standards Organization (ISO) code for the country of ultimate destination);
(v) Date of export (the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the date the cargo is scheduled to leave the United States for all modes of transportation; if the actual date is not known, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the best estimate as to the time of departure); and
(vi) Port of export (the port where the outbound cargo departs from the United States is designated by its unique code, as set forth in Annex C, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the port of exportation as known when the USPPI, USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent tenders the cargo to the outbound carrier; should the carrier export the cargo from a different port and the carrier so informs the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent, the port of exportation must be corrected by the filer in AES.).
(3)
Proof of electronic filing; exemption from filing.
The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must furnish to the exporting carrier a proof of EEI filing citation (the ITN), post-departure filing citation, AES downtime filing citation (when allowed), and the exclusion, and/or exemption legends (see paragraph (d) of this section) for annotation on the carrier's outward manifest, waybill, or other export documentation covering the cargo to be shipped. The proof of EEI filing citation (the ITN), post-departure filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exclusion, and/or exemption legend must conform to the approved EEI filing citation, exclusion, and/or exemption legend formats in Appendix B to the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR part 30, Appendix B).
(4)
Carrier responsibility
—(i)
Loading of cargo.
The carrier may not load cargo without first receiving from the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent either the related electronic filing citation as prescribed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or an appropriate exemption legend for the cargo as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
High-risk cargo.
For cargo that CBP has identified as potentially high-risk, the carrier, after being duly notified by CBP, will be responsible for delivering the cargo for inspection/examination. When cargo identified as high risk has already been exported, CBP may demand that the export carrier redeliver the cargo in accordance with the terms of its international carrier bond (see § 113.64(m)(2) of this chapter).
(5)
USPPI receipt of information believed to be accurate.
When the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent electronically presenting the cargo information required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section receives any of this information from another party, CBP will take into consideration how, in accordance with ordinary commercial practices, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent acquired this information, and whether and how the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent is able to verify this information. When the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent is not reasonably able to verify any information received, CBP will permit this party to electronically present the information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be true.
(d)
Exemptions from reporting; Census exemptions or exclusions applicable.
The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must furnish to the outbound carrier an appropriate exemption or exclusion legend for any export shipment laden that is not subject to predeparture electronic information filing under this section. The exemption or exclusion legend must conform to the proper format approved by the Census Bureau (see 15 CFR part 30, Appendix B). Any exemptions or exclusions from reporting requirements for export cargo are enumerated in §§ 30.2 and 30.35 through 30.40 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.2 and 30.35 through 30.40). These exemptions or exclusions under §§ 30.2 and 30.35 through 30.40 of the Census Bureau's FTR are equally applicable under this section.
