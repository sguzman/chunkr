Account holder
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), the account holder is the person listed or identified as the holder or owner of the account with the FFI that maintains the account, regardless of whether such person is a flow-through entity. Thus, for example, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if a trust (including a simple or grantor trust) or an estate is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, the trust or estate is the account holder, rather than its owners or beneficiaries. Similarly, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners in the partnership. In the case of an account held by an entity that is disregarded for U.S. federal tax purposes under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter, the account shall be treated as held by the person owning such entity. With respect to an account held by an exempt beneficial owner, such account is treated as held by an exempt beneficial owner only when all payments
made to such account would be treated as made to an exempt beneficial owner. See § 1.1471-6(h) for when a payment derived from certain commercial activities is not treated as made to an exempt beneficial owner.
(ii)
Financial accounts held by agents that are not financial institutions.
A person, other than a financial institution, that holds a financial account for the benefit or account of another person as an agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as an account holder with respect to such account for purposes of this section. Instead, such other person is treated as the account holder.
(iii)
Jointly held accounts.
With respect to a jointly held account, each joint holder is treated as an account holder for purposes of determining whether the account is a U.S. account. Thus, an account is a U.S. account if any of the account holders is a specified U.S. person or a U.S. owned foreign entity and the account is not otherwise excepted from U.S. account status under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. When more than one U.S. person is a joint holder, each U.S. person will be treated as an account holder and will be attributed the entire balance of the jointly held account, including for purposes of applying the aggregation rules set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iv)
Account holder for insurance and annuity contracts.
An insurance or annuity contract is held by each person that is entitled to access the contract's value (for example, through a loan, withdrawal, surrender, or otherwise) or change a beneficiary under the contract. If no person can access the contract's value or change a beneficiary, the account holders are any person named in the contract as an owner and any person who is entitled to receive a future payment under the terms of the contract. When an obligation to pay an amount under the contract becomes fixed, each person entitled to receive a payment is an account holder.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

# Example 1. Account held by agent.
F, a nonresident alien, holds a power of attorney from U, a specified U.S. person, that authorizes F to open, hold, and make deposits and withdrawals with respect to a depository account on behalf of U. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. F is listed as the holder of the depository account at a participating FFI, but because F holds the account as an agent for the benefit of U, F is not ultimately entitled to the funds in the account. Because the depository account is treated as held by U, a specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.

# Example 2. Jointly held accounts.
U, a specified U.S. person, holds a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is jointly held with A, an individual who is a nonresident alien. Because one of the joint holders is a specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.

# Example 3. Jointly held accounts.
U and Q, both specified U.S. persons, hold a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is a U.S. account and both U and Q are treated as holders of the account.
(4)
Exceptions to U.S. account status
—(i)
Exception for certain individual accounts of participating FFIs.
Unless a participating FFI elects under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section not to apply this paragraph (a)(4)(i), the term
U.S. account
shall not include any depository account maintained by such financial institution during a calendar year if the account is held solely by one or more individuals and, with respect to each holder of such account, the aggregate balance or value of all depository accounts held by each such individual does not exceed $50,000 as of the end of the calendar year or on the date the account is closed. For rules for determining the account balance or value, see paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (b)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Election to forgo exception.
A participating FFI may elect to disregard the exception described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section by reporting all U.S. accounts, including those accounts that would otherwise meet the conditions of the exception.
(iii)
Example. Aggregation rules for exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts.
In Year 1, a U.S. resident individual, U, holds a depository account with CB, a commercial bank that is a participating FFI. The balance in U's CB account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. In Year 1, U also holds
a custodial account with CB's brokerage business. The custodial account has a $45,000 balance as of the end of Year 1. CB's retail banking and brokerage businesses share computerized information management systems that associate U's depository account and U's custodial account with U and with one another within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. For purposes of applying the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, however, a depository account is aggregated only with other depository accounts. Therefore, U's depository account is eligible for the paragraph (a)(4)(i) exception to U.S. account status because the balance of the depository account does not exceed $50,000.

(4)
Account balance or value.
This paragraph (b)(4) provides rules for determining the balance or value of a financial account for purposes of chapter 4. For example, the rules of this paragraph apply for purposes of determining whether an FFI meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(ii) or (f)(3) of this section to certify to a deemed-compliant FFI status. The rules of this paragraph also apply to a participating FFI's due diligence and reporting obligations to the extent required under § 1.1471-4(c) or (d) and to a U.S. withholding agent's due diligence obligations to the extent required under § 1.1471-3.
(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section with respect to immediate annuities, the balance or value of a financial account is the balance or value calculated by the financial institution for purposes of reporting to the account holder. In the case of an account described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this
section, the balance or value of an equity interest is the value calculated by the financial institution for the purpose that requires the most frequent determination of value, and the balance or value of a debt interest is its principal amount. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, the balance or value of an insurance or annuity contract is the balance or value as of either the calendar year end or the most recent contract anniversary date. The balance or value of the account is not to be reduced by any liabilities or obligations incurred by an account holder with respect to the account or any of the assets held in the account and is not to be reduced by any fees, penalties, or other charges for which the account holder may be liable upon terminating, transferring, surrendering, liquidating, or withdrawing cash from the account. Each holder of a jointly held account is attributed the entire balance or value of the joint account. See § 1.1473-1(b)(3) for rules regarding the valuation of trust interests that also apply under this paragraph (b)(4)(i) to determine the value of trust interests that are financial accounts.
(ii)
Special rule for immediate annuity
—(A)
Immediate annuities without minimum benefit guarantees.
If the value of an immediate annuity contract with no minimum benefit guarantee is not reported to the account holder, the account balance or value of the contract is the sum of the net present values on the valuation date of the amounts reasonably expected to be payable in future periods under the contract.
(B)
Immediate annuities with a minimum benefit guarantee.
The account balance or value of an annuity contract with a minimum guarantee is the sum of the net present values on the valuation date of—
(
1
) The non-guaranteed amounts reasonably expected to be payable in future periods; and
(
2
) The guaranteed amounts payable in future periods.
(C)
Net present value of amounts payable in future periods.
The net present value of an amount payable in a future period shall be determined using—
(
1
) A reasonable actuarial valuation method, and
(
2
) The mortality tables and interest rate(s)—
(
i
) Prescribed pursuant to section 7520 and the regulations thereunder; or
(
ii
) Used by the issuer of the contract to determine the amounts payable under the contract.
(iii)
Account aggregation requirements
—(A)
In general.
To the extent a financial institution is required under chapter 4 to determine the aggregate balance or value of an account, the financial institution is required to aggregate the account balance or value of all accounts that are held (in whole or in part) by the same person and that are maintained by the financial institution or members of its expanded affiliated group, but only to the extent that the financial institution's computerized systems link the accounts by reference to a data element, such as client number, EIN, or foreign tax identifying number, and allow the account balances of such accounts to be aggregated. Notwithstanding the rules set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), a financial institution is required to aggregate the balance or value of accounts that it treats as consolidated obligations.
(B)
Aggregation rule for relationship managers.
To the extent a financial institution is required under chapter 4 to apply the aggregation rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the financial institution also is required to aggregate all accounts that a relationship manager knows are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, as well as all accounts that the relationship manager has associated with one another through a relationship code, customer identification number, TIN, or similar indicator, or that the relationship manager would typically associate with each other under the procedures of the financial institution (or the department, division, or unit with which the relationship manager is associated).
(
C
)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the account aggregation requirements of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii):

# Example 1. FFI not required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account exception.
A U.S. resident individual, U, holds a depository account with Branch 1 of CB, a commercial
bank that is a participating FFI. The balance in U's Branch 1 account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also holds a depository account with Branch 2 of CB, with a $45,000 balance at the end of Year 1. CB's retail banking businesses share computerized information management systems across its branches, but U's accounts are not associated with one another in the shared computerized information system. In addition, CB has not assigned a relationship manager to U or U's accounts. Because the accounts are not associated in CB's system or by a relationship manager, CB is not required to aggregate the accounts under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) and both accounts are eligible for the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section as neither account exceeds the $50,000 threshold.

# Example 2. FFI required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account exception.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that both of U's depository accounts are associated with U and with one another by reference to CB's internal identification number. The system shows the account balances for both accounts, and such balances may be electronically aggregated, though the system does not show a combined balance for the accounts. In determining whether such accounts meet the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less, CB is required to aggregate the account balances of all depository accounts under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Under those rules, U is treated as holding depository accounts with CB with an aggregate balance of $80,000. Accordingly, neither account is eligible for the exception to U.S. account status, because the accounts, when aggregated, exceed the $50,000 threshold.

# Example 3. Aggregation rules for joint accounts maintained by a participating FFI.
In Year 1, a U.S. resident individual, U, holds a custodial account that is a preexisting account at custodial institution CI, a participating FFI. The balance in U's CI custodial account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also holds a joint custodial account that is a preexisting account with her sister, A, a nonresident alien for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with another custodial institution, CI2. The balance in the joint account at the end of Year 1 is also $35,000. CI and CI2 are part of the same expanded affiliated group and share computerized information management systems. Both U's custodial account at CI and U and A's custodial account at CI2 are associated with U and with one another by reference to CI's internal identification number and the system allows the balances to be aggregated. In determining whether such accounts meet the documentation exception described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4)(iv) for certain preexisting individual accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less, CI is required to aggregate the account balances of accounts held in whole or in part by the same account holder under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Under those rules, U is treated as having financial accounts with C1 and CI2, each with an aggregate balance of $70,000. Accordingly, neither account is eligible for the documentation exception.

# Example 4. Aggregation for applying indefinite validity periods.
In Year 1, an owner-documented FFI, O, holds an offshore account with Branch 1 of CB, a commercial bank that is a U.S. withholding agent. The balance in O's CB account at the end of Year 1 is $600,000. In Year 1, O also holds an account in the United States with Branch 2 of CB. The Branch 2 account has a $450,000 balance at the end of Year 1. CB's banking businesses share computerized information management systems across its branches. O's accounts are associated with one another in the shared computerized information system and the system allows the balances to be aggregated. In determining whether CB is permitted to apply an indefinite validity period for the documentation submitted for O's account at Branch 1 pursuant to § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(
4
) (permitting indefinite validity for a withholding statement of an owner-documented FFI if the balance or value of all accounts held by the owner-documented FFI does not exceed $1,000,000), CB is required to aggregate the account balance of O's accounts at Branch 1 and Branch 2 to the extent required under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, O is treated as holding financial accounts with CB with an aggregate balance of $1,050,000 and the documentation submitted for O's account at Branch 1 is not eligible for the indefinite validity period described under § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(
4
).
(iv)
Currency translation of balance or value.
If the balance or value of a financial account, other obligation, or the aggregate amount payable under a group life or group annuity contract described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4) is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, a withholding agent must calculate the balance or value by applying a spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) to translate such balance or value into the U.S. dollar equivalent. For the purpose of a participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI reporting an account under § 1.1471-4(d), the spot rate must be determined as of the last day of the calendar year (or, in the case of
an insurance contract or annuity contract, the most recent contract anniversary date, when applicable) for which the account is being reported or, if the account was closed during such calendar year, the date the account was closed. In the case of an FFI determining whether an account meets (or continues to meet) a preexisting account documentation exception described in § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii) or (c)(5)(iii), or whether the account is an account described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the spot rate must be determined on the date for which the FFI is determining the threshold amount as prescribed in those provisions.
(5)
Account maintained by financial institution.
A custodial account is maintained by the financial institution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a financial institution that holds assets in street name for an account holder in such institution). A depository account is maintained by the financial institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an agent of a financial institution regardless of whether such agent is a financial institution under paragraph (e)(1) of this section). Any equity or debt interest in a financial institution that constitutes a financial account under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is maintained by such financial institution. A cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section is maintained by the financial institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract.
(c)
U.S. owned foreign entity.
The term
U.S. owned foreign entity

(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section:

# Example 1. Investment advisor.
Fund Manager is an investment entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Fund Manager, among its various business operations, organizes and manages a variety of funds, including Fund A, a fund that invests primarily in equities. Fund Manager hires Investment Advisor, a foreign entity, to provide advice and discretionary management of a portion of the financial assets held by Fund A. Investment Advisor earned more than 50% of its gross income for the last three years from providing similar services. Because Investment Advisor primarily conducts a business of managing financial assets on behalf of clients, Investment Advisor is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Example 2. Entity that is managed by an FFI.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, in every year since it was organized, Fund A has earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing in financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed by Fund Manager and Investment Advisor and its gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets.

# Example 3. Investment manager.
Investment Manager, a U.S. entity, is an investment entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Investment Manager organizes and registers Fund A in Country A. Investment Manager is authorized to facilitate purchases and sales of financial assets held by Fund A in accordance with Fund A's investment strategy. In every year since it was organized, Fund A has earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Example 4. Foreign real estate investment fund that is managed by an FFI.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that Fund A's assets consist solely of non-debt, direct interests in real property located within and without the United States. Fund A is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, even though it is managed by Investment Manager, because less than 50% of its gross income is attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets.

# Example 5. Trust managed by an individual.
On January 1, 2013, X, an individual, establishes Trust A, a nongrantor foreign trust for the benefit of X's children, Y and Z. X appoints Trustee A, an individual, to act as the trustee of Trust A. Trust A's assets consists solely of financial assets, and its income consists solely of income from those financial assets. Pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, Trustee A manages and administers the assets of the trust. Trustee A does not hire any entity as a third-party service provider to perform any of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Trust A is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed solely by Trustee A, an individual.

# Example 6. Trust managed by a trust company.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that X hires Trust Company, an FFI, to act as trustee on behalf of Trust A. As trustee, Trust Company manages and administers the assets of Trust A in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument for the benefit of Y and Z. Because Trust A is managed by an FFI, Trust A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Example 7.
Individual introducing broker.
IB, an individual introducing broker, primarily conducts a business of providing advice to clients, has discretionary authority to manage clients' assets, and uses the services of a foreign entity to conduct and execute trades on behalf of clients. IB provides services as an investment advisor and manager to Entity, a foreign corporation. Entity has earned 50% or more of its gross income for the past three years from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. Because IB is an individual, notwithstanding that IB primarily conducts certain investment-related activities, IB is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
Further, Entity is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because Entity is managed by IB, an individual.

# Example 8.
Entity introducing broker.
IB, a foreign entity introducing broker, primarily conducts a business of providing advice to clients, has discretionary authority to manage clients' assets, and uses the services of a foreign entity to conduct and execute trades on behalf of clients. IB provides its services as an investment advisor and manager to Entity, a foreign corporation. Entity has earned 50% or more of its gross income for the past three years from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. Because IB is an entity that primarily conducts certain investment-related activities, IB is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Further, Entity is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed by IB, an investment entity that performs certain of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section on behalf of Entity.

(
2
) The entity is a holding company, treasury center, or captive finance company and substantially all the activities of such entity are to perform one or more of the functions described in paragraphs (e)(5)(i)(C), (D), or (E) of this section; and

For purposes of determining whether an entity was formed in connection with or availed of by such an arrangement or investment vehicle, any entity that existed at least six months prior to its acquisition by such arrangement or investment vehicle and that, prior to the acquisition, regularly conducted activities described in paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C), (D), or (E) of this section will not be considered to have been formed in connection with or availed of by the arrangement or investment vehicle, in the absence of other facts suggesting the existence of an investment strategy described in the prior sentence.
(B)
Nonfinancial group.
An expanded affiliated group defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section is a nonfinancial group if, taking into account the application of this section—
(

) For the three-year period (or the period during which the expanded affiliated group has been in existence, if shorter) ending on December 31 (or the end of the fiscal year of one or more members of the group) of the year preceding the year in which the determination is made, no more than 25 percent of the gross income of the expanded affiliated group (excluding income derived by any member that is an entity described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section, income derived from transactions between members of the expanded affiliated group, and interest income on notes issued by customers to a member of the expanded affiliated group that is a captive finance company to finance the customer's purchase of inventory or goods that are manufactured by a member of the expanded affiliated group) consists of passive income (as defined in § 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iv)); no more than five percent of the gross income of the expanded affiliated group is derived by members of the expanded affiliated group that are FFIs (excluding income derived from transactions between members of the expanded affiliated group or by any member of the expanded affiliated group that is a certified deemed-compliant FFI); and no more than 25 percent of the value of assets held by the expanded affiliated group (excluding assets held by a member that is an entity described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section, assets resulting from transactions between related
members of the expanded affiliated group, and receivables that are notes issued by customers to a member of the expanded affiliated group that is a captive finance company to finance the customer's purchase of inventory or goods that are manufactured by a member of the expanded affiliated group) are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income; and
(
2
) Any member of the expanded affiliated group that is an FFI is a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner. However, an acquisition by a member of the expanded affiliated group of an FFI that is not a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, or a change in the chapter 4 status of a member of the expanded affiliated group, will not cause a nonfinancial group to cease to be a nonfinancial group until 90 days after the acquisition or change in chapter 4 status.
(C)
Holding company.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(i), an entity is a holding company if its primary activity consists of holding (directly or indirectly) all or part of the outstanding stock of one or more members of its expanded affiliated group. A partnership or any other non-corporate entity shall be treated as a holding company if substantially all the activities of such partnership (or other entity) consist of holding more than 50 percent of the voting power and value of the stock of one or more common parent corporation(s) of one or more expanded affiliated group(s). If a partnership or other non-corporate entity owns more than 50 percent of the voting power and value of the stock of more than one common parent corporation of an expanded affiliated group, each common parent corporation's expanded affiliated group will be treated as a separate expanded affiliated group for purposes of applying the rules of this section unless a non-corporate entity is treated as the common parent entity of the expanded affiliated group in accordance with § 1.1471-5(i)(10).
(D)
Treasury center
—(
1
) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an entity is a treasury center for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(i) if the primary activity of such entity is to enter into investment, hedging, and financing transactions with or for members of its expanded affiliated group for purposes of—

(
v
) Acting as a financing vehicle for the expanded affiliated group (or any member thereof).

A deemed-compliant FFI that complies with the due diligence and withholding requirements applicable to such entity as provided in this paragraph (f) will also be deemed to have met its withholding obligations under sections 1471(a) and 1472(a). For this purpose, an intermediary or flow-through entity that has a residual withholding obligation under § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii) must fulfill such obligation to be considered a deemed-compliant FFI.
(1)
Registered deemed-compliant FFIs.
A registered deemed-compliant FFI means an FFI that meets the procedural requirements described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section and that either is described in any of paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A) through (F) of this section or is treated as a registered deemed-compliant FFI under a Model 2 IGA. A registered deemed-compliant FFI also includes any FFI, or branch of an FFI, that is a reporting Model 1 FFI that complies with the registration requirements of a Model 1 IGA.
(i)
Registered deemed-compliant FFI categories
—(A)
Local FFIs.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) if the FFI meets the following requirements.
(
1
) The FFI is licensed and regulated as a financial institution under the laws of its country of incorporation or organization (which must be a FATF-compliant jurisdiction at the time the FFI registers for deemed-compliant status).
(
2
) The FFI does not have a fixed place of business outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.
(
3
) The FFI does not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, an FFI will not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it operates a Web site, provided that the Web site does not specifically indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents, and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders. An FFI will also not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not specifically indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders.
(
4
) The FFI is required under the laws of its country of incorporation or organization to identify resident account holders for purposes of either information reporting or withholding of tax with respect to accounts held by residents or is required to identify resident accounts for purposes of satisfying such country's AML due diligence requirements.
(
5
) At least 98 percent of the accounts by value maintained by the FFI as of the last day of the preceding calendar year are held by residents (including residents that are entities) of the country in which the FFI is incorporated or organized. An FFI that is incorporated or organized in a member state of the European Union may treat account holders that are residents (including residents that are entities) of other member states of the European Union as residents of the country in which the FFI is incorporated or organized for purposes of this calculation.
(
6
) By the later of June 30, 2014, or the date it registers as a deemed-compliant FFI, the FFI implements policies and procedures, consistent with those set forth for a participating FFI under § 1.1471-4(c), to monitor whether the FFI opens or maintains an account for a specified U.S. person who is not a resident of the country in which the FFI is incorporated or organized (including a U.S. person that was a resident when the account was opened but subsequently ceases to be a resident), an entity controlled or beneficially owned (as determined under the FFI's AML due diligence) by one or more specified U.S. persons that are not residents of the country in which the FFI is incorporated or organized, or a nonparticipating FFI. Such policies and procedures must provide that if any such account is discovered, the FFI will close such account, transfer such account to a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, or withhold and report on such account as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if the FFI were a participating FFI.
(
7
) With respect to each preexisting account held by a nonresident of the country in which the FFI is organized or held by an entity, the FFI reviews those accounts in accordance with the procedures described in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to preexisting accounts to identify any U.S. account or account held by a nonparticipating FFI, and certifies to the IRS that it did not identify any such account as a result of its review, that it has closed any such accounts that were identified or transferred them to a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, or that it agrees to withhold and report on such accounts as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if it were a participating FFI. Such certification must be submitted by the due date of the FFI's first certification of compliance required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(
8
) In the case of an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group, each FFI in the group is incorporated or organized in the same country and, with the exception of any member that is a retirement plan described in § 1.1471-6(f), meets the requirements set forth in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) and the procedural requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.
(
9
) The FFI does not have policies or practices that discriminate against opening or maintaining accounts for individuals who are specified U.S. persons and who are residents of the FFI's country of incorporation or organization.
(B)
Nonreporting members of participating FFI groups.
An FFI that is a member of a participating FFI group is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) if it meets the following requirements.
(
1
) By the later of June 30, 2014, or the date it registers with the IRS pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the FFI implements policies and procedures to ensure that within six months of opening a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI, the FFI either transfers such account to an affiliate that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, closes the account, or becomes a participating FFI.
(
2
) The FFI reviews its accounts that were opened prior to the time it implements the policies and procedures (including time frames) described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, using the procedures described in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to preexisting accounts of participating FFIs, to identify any U.S. account or account held by a nonparticipating FFI. Within six months of the identification of any account described in this paragraph, the FFI transfers the account to an affiliate that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, closes the account, or becomes a participating FFI.
(
3
) By the later of June 30, 2014, or the date it registers with the IRS pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the FFI implements policies and procedures to ensure that it identifies any account that becomes a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI due to a change in circumstances. Within six months of the date on which the FFI first has knowledge or reason to know of the change
in the account holder's chapter 4 status, the FFI transfers any such account to an affiliate that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, closes the account, or becomes a participating FFI.
(C)
Qualified collective investment vehicles.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) if it meets the following requirements.
(
1
) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity, and it is regulated as an investment fund either in its country of incorporation or organization or in all of the countries in which it is registered and all of the countries in which it operates. A fund will be considered to be regulated as an investment fund under this paragraph if its manager is regulated with respect to the investment fund in all of the countries in which the investment fund is registered and in all of the countries in which the investment fund operates.
(
2
) Each holder of record of direct debt interests in the FFI in excess of $50,000, of any direct equity interests in the FFI (for example the holders of its units or global certificates), and of any other account holder of the FFI is a participating FFI, a registered deemed-compliant FFI, a retirement plan described in § 1.1471-6(f), a non-profit organization described in paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section, a U.S. person that is not a specified U.S. person, a nonreporting IGA FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, an FFI will not be prohibited from qualifying as a qualified collective investment vehicle solely because it has issued interests in bearer form provided that the FFI ceased issuing interests in such form after December 31, 2012, retires all such interests upon surrender, and establishes policies and procedures to redeem or immobilize all such interests prior to January 1, 2017, and that prior to payment the FFI documents the account holder in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to accounts other than preexisting accounts and agrees to withhold and report on such accounts as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if it were a participating FFI. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C), an FFI may disregard equity interests owned by specified U.S. persons acquired with seed capital within the meaning of paragraph (i)(4) of this section if the specified U.S. person is described in paragraph (i)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section (substituting the term
U.S. person
for the terms
FFI
and
member
), and the specified U.S. person neither has held, nor intends to hold, such interest for more than three years.
(
3
) In the case of an FFI that is part of an expanded affiliated group, all other FFIs in the expanded affiliated group are participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, sponsored FFIs described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section, nonreporting IGA FFIs, or exempt beneficial owners.
(D)
Restricted funds.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D) if it meets the following requirements.
(
1
) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity, and it is regulated as an investment fund under the laws of its country of incorporation or organization (which must be a FATF-compliant jurisdiction at the time the FFI registers for deemed-compliant status) or in all of the countries in which it is registered and in all of the countries in which it operates. A fund will be considered to be regulated as an investment fund for purposes of this paragraph if its manager is regulated with respect to the fund in all of the countries in which the investment fund is registered and in all of the countries in which the investment fund operates.
(
2
) Interests issued directly by the fund are redeemed by or transferred by the fund rather than sold by investors on any secondary market. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, an FFI will not be prohibited from qualifying as a restricted fund solely because it issued interests in bearer form provided that the FFI ceased issuing interests in bearer form after December 31, 2012, retires all such interests upon surrender, and establishes policies and procedures to redeem or immobilize all such interests prior to January 1, 2017, and that prior to payment the FFI documents the account holder in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to accounts other than preexisting accounts and
agrees to withhold and report on such accounts as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if it were a participating FFI. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D), interests in the FFI that are issued by the fund through a transfer agent or distributor that does not hold the interests as a nominee of the account holder will be considered to have been issued directly by the fund.
(
3
) Interests that are not issued directly by the fund are sold only through distributors that are participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, nonregistering local banks described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, or restricted distributors described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D) and paragraph (f)(4) of this section, a distributor means an underwriter, broker, dealer, or other person who participates, pursuant to a contractual arrangement with the FFI, in the distribution of securities and holds interests in the FFI as a nominee.
(
4
) The FFI ensures that by the later of December 31, 2014, or six months after the date the FFI registers as a deemed-compliant FFI, each agreement that governs the distribution of its debt or equity interests prohibits sales and other transfers of debt or equity interests in the FFI (other than interests that are both distributed by and held through a participating FFI) to specified U.S. persons, nonparticipating FFIs, or passive NFFEs with one or more substantial U.S. owners. In addition, by that date, the FFI's prospectus and all marketing materials must indicate that sales and other transfers of interests in the FFI to specified U.S. persons, nonparticipating FFIs, or passive NFFEs with one or more substantial U.S. owners are prohibited unless such interests are both distributed by and held through a participating FFI.
(
5
) The FFI ensures that by the later of December 31, 2014, or six months after the date the FFI registers as a deemed-compliant FFI, each agreement entered into by the FFI that governs the distribution of its debt or equity interests requires the distributor to notify the FFI of a change in the distributor's chapter 4 status within 90 days of the change. The FFI must, with respect to any distributor that ceases to qualify as a distributor identified in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D)(
3
) of this section, terminate its distribution agreement with the distributor, or cause the distribution agreement to be terminated, within 90 days of the notification of the distributor's change in status and, with respect to all debt and equity interests of the FFI issued through that distributor, redeem those interests, convert those interests to direct holdings in the fund, or cause those interests to be transferred to another distributor identified in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D)(
3
) of this section within six months of the distributor's change in status.
(
6
) With respect to any of the FFI's preexisting direct accounts that are held by the beneficial owner of the interest in the FFI, the FFI reviews those accounts in accordance with the procedures (and time frames) described in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to preexisting accounts to identify any U.S. account or account held by a nonparticipating FFI. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the FFI will not be required to review the account of any individual investor that purchased its interest at a time when all of the FFI's distribution agreements and its prospectus contained an explicit prohibition of the issuance and/or sale of shares to U.S. entities and U.S. resident individuals. An FFI will not be required to review the account of any investor that purchased its interest in bearer form until the time of payment, but at such time will be required to document the account in accordance with procedures set forth in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to accounts other than preexisting accounts. The FFI is required to certify to the IRS either that it did not identify any U.S. account or account held by a nonparticipating FFI as a result of its review or, if any such accounts were identified, that the FFI will either redeem such accounts, transfer such accounts to an affiliate or other FFI that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, or withhold and report on such accounts as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if it were a participating FFI. Such certification must be submitted to the IRS by the due date
of the FFI's first certification of compliance required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(
7
) By the later of June 30, 2014, or the date that it registers as a deemed-compliant FFI, the FFI implements the policies and procedures described in § 1.1471-4(c) to ensure that it either—
(
i
) Does not open or maintain an account for, or make a withholdable payment to, any specified U.S. person, nonparticipating FFI, or passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners and, if it discovers any such accounts, closes all accounts for any such person within six months of the date that the FFI had reason to know the account holder became such a person; or
(
ii
) Withholds and reports on any account held by, or any withholdable payment made to, any specified U.S. person, nonparticipating FFI, or passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners to the extent and in the manner that would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if the FFI were a participating FFI.
(
8
) For an FFI that is part of an expanded affiliated group, all other FFIs in the expanded affiliated group are participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, sponsored FFIs described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section, nonreporting IGA FFIs, or exempt beneficial owners.
(E)
Qualified credit card issuers and servicers.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(E) if the FFI meets the following requirements.
(
1
) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an issuer or servicer of credit cards that accepts deposits, on its own behalf or, in the case of a servicer, on behalf of a credit card issuer, only when a customer makes a payment in excess of a balance due with respect to the credit card account and the overpayment is not immediately returned to the customer.
(
2
) By the later of June 30, 2014, or the date it registers as a deemed-compliant FFI, the FFI implements policies and procedures to either prevent a customer deposit in excess of $50,000 or to ensure that any customer deposit in excess of $50,000 is refunded to the customer within 60 days. For this purpose, a customer deposit does not refer to credit balances to the extent of disputed charges but does include credit balances resulting from merchandise returns.
(F)
Sponsored investment entities and controlled foreign corporations.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) if the FFI is described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section and the sponsoring entity meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
) of this section.
(
1
) An FFI is a sponsored investment entity described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
1
) if—
(
i
) It is an investment entity that is not a QI, WP (except to the extent permitted in the WP agreement), or WT; and
(
ii
) An entity, other than a nonparticipating FFI, has agreed with the FFI to act as a sponsoring entity for the FFI.
(
2
) An FFI is a sponsored controlled foreign corporation described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
2
) if the FFI meets the following requirements—
(
i
) The FFI is a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957(a) that is not a QI, WP, or WT;
(
ii
) The FFI is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. financial institution that agrees with the FFI to act as a sponsoring entity for the FFI; and
(
iii
) The FFI shares a common electronic account system with the sponsoring entity that enables the sponsoring entity to identify all account holders and payees of the FFI and to access all account and customer information maintained by the FFI including, but not limited to, customer identification information, customer documentation, account balance, and all payments made to the account holder or payee.
(
3
) A sponsoring entity described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
1
)(
ii
) or (f)(1)(i)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section meets the requirements of this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
) if the sponsoring entity—
(
i
) Is authorized to act on behalf of the FFI (such as a fund manager, trustee, corporate director, or managing partner) to fulfill all due diligence, withholding, and reporting responsibilities that the FFI would have assumed if it were a participating FFI;
(
ii
) Has registered with the IRS as a sponsoring entity;
(
iii
) Has registered the FFI with the IRS by the later of January 1, 2017, or the date that the FFI identifies itself as qualifying under this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F);
(
iv
) Agrees to perform, on behalf of the FFI, all due diligence, withholding, reporting, and other requirements that the FFI would have been required to perform if it were a participating FFI;
(
v
) Identifies the FFI in all reporting completed on the FFI's behalf to the extent required under §§ 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(C) and 1.1474-1;
(
vi
) Complies with the verification procedures described in paragraph (j) of this section; and
(
vii
) Has not had its status as a sponsoring entity revoked.
(
4
) The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs based on the provisions of paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section (describing notice of event of default, remediation, and termination procedures) if there is an event of default as defined in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
(
5
) A sponsoring entity is not liable for any failure to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
) of this section unless the sponsoring entity is a withholding agent that is separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. A sponsored FFI will remain liable for any failure of its sponsoring entity to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
) of this section that the sponsoring entity has agreed to undertake on behalf of the FFI, even if the sponsoring entity is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.
(ii)
Procedural requirements for registered deemed-compliant FFIs.
A registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section may use one or more agents to perform the necessary due diligence to identify its account holders and to take any required action associated with obtaining and maintaining its deemed-compliant status. The FFI, however, remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements for its deemed-compliant status are met. Unless otherwise provided in this section, a registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section is required to—
(A) Register with the IRS pursuant to procedures prescribed by the IRS and agree to comply with the terms of its registered deemed-compliant status.
(B) Have its responsible officer certify, on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of each certification period, that all of the requirements for the deemed-compliant status claimed by the FFI have been satisfied during the certification period. The responsible officer may certify collectively for the FFI's expanded affiliated group that all of the requirements for the deemed-compliant status claimed by each member of the expanded affiliated group that is a registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a member that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable Model 1 IGA) have been satisfied. The certification must be made on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. The first certification period begins on the later of the date the FFI registers as a deemed-compliant FFI and is issued a GIIN, or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following that date. Each subsequent certification period is the three calendar year period following the previous certification period.
(C) Maintain in its records the confirmation from the IRS of the FFI's registration as a deemed-compliant FFI and GIIN or such other information as the IRS specifies in forms or other guidance; and
(D) Agree to notify the IRS if there is a change in circumstances that would make the FFI ineligible for the deemed-compliant status for which it has registered, and to do so within six months of the change in circumstances
unless the FFI is able to resume its eligibility for its registered-deemed compliant status within the six month notification period.
(iii)
Deemed-compliant FFI that is merged or acquired.
A deemed-compliant FFI that becomes a participating FFI or a member of a participating FFI group as a result of a merger or acquisition will not be required to redetermine the chapter 4 status of any account maintained by the FFI prior to the date of the merger or acquisition unless that account has a subsequent change in circumstances.
(iv)
IRS review of compliance by registered deemed-compliant FFIs
—(A)
General inquiries.
With respect to a registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A), (C), or (D) of this section, the IRS, based upon the information reporting forms described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) filed with the IRS for each calendar year (if applicable), may request additional information with respect to the information reported (or required to be reported) on the forms, the account statements described in § 1.1471-4(d)(4)(v), or confirmation that the FFI has no reporting requirements for the calendar year. The IRS may request additional information from the FFI to determine the FFI's compliance with § 1.1471-4 (if applicable) and to assist the IRS with its review of account holder compliance with tax reporting requirements. For IRS review of compliance with respect to a registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) of this section (describing sponsored investment entities and controlled foreign corporations), see paragraph (j)(4) of this section.
(B)
Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.
With respect to a registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section, the IRS may determine in its discretion that the FFI may not have substantially complied with the requirements of the deemed-compliant status claimed by the FFI. This determination is based on the information reporting forms described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) filed with the IRS for each calendar year (if applicable), the certifications made by the responsible officer described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (or the absence of such certifications), or any other information related to the FFI's compliance with the requirements of the deemed-compliant status claimed by the FFI. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer (or designee) information necessary to verify the FFI's compliance with the requirements for the deemed-compliant status claimed by the FFI. For example, in the case of a local FFI under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the IRS may request a description or copy of the FFI's policies and procedures for identifying accounts held by specified U.S. persons not resident in the jurisdiction in which the FFI is incorporated or organized, identifying entities controlled or beneficially owned by such persons, and identifying nonparticipating FFIs. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the facts and circumstances surrounding the FFI's potential failure to comply with the requirements of the deemed-compliant category claimed by the FFI. If the IRS determines that the FFI has not complied with the requirements of the deemed-compliant status claimed by the FFI, the IRS may terminate the FFI's deemed-compliant status. If the FFI's deemed-compliant status is terminated, the FFI must send notice of the termination to each withholding agent from which it receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided within 30 days after the termination. An FFI that has had its deemed-compliant status terminated may not reregister on the FATCA registration website as a registered deemed-compliant FFI or register on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI unless it receives written approval from the IRS. A registered deemed-compliant FFI may request, within 90 days of a notice of termination, reconsideration of the notice of termination by written request to the IRS.
(2)
Certified deemed-compliant FFIs.
A certified deemed-compliant FFI means an FFI described in any of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (v) of this section that has certified as to its status as a deemed-compliant FFI by providing a withholding agent with the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(5) applicable to the relevant deemed-compliant category. A certified deemed-compliant FFI is not required to register with the IRS.
(i)
Nonregistering local bank.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(i) if the FFI meets the following requirements.
(A) The FFI operates solely as (and is licensed and regulated under the laws of its country of incorporation or organization as)—
(
1
) A bank; or
(
2
) A credit union or similar cooperative credit organization that is operated without profit.
(B) The FFI's business consists primarily of receiving deposits from and making loans to, with respect to a bank, retail customers that are unrelated to such bank and, with respect to a credit union or similar cooperative credit organization, members, provided that no such member has a greater than 5 percent interest in such credit union or cooperative credit organization. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B), a customer is related to a bank if the customer and the bank have a relationship described in section 267(b). For purposes of determining whether a member has a greater than 5 percent interest in a credit union or cooperative credit organization, the member must aggregate the ownership or beneficial interests in the credit union or cooperative credit organization that are owned or held by a related member. A member of a credit union or cooperative credit organization is related to another member if the relationship of such members is described in section 267(b).
(C) The FFI does not have a fixed place of business outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.
(D) The FFI does not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, an FFI will not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it operates a Web site, provided that the Web site does not permit account opening, does not indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents, and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders. An FFI will also not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders.

(F) With respect to an FFI that is part of an expanded affiliated group, each member of the expanded affiliated group is incorporated or organized in the same country and does not have a fixed place of business outside of that country. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions. Further, each FFI in the group, other than an FFI described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section or § 1.1471-6(f), meets the requirements set forth in this paragraph (f)(2)(i). For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.
(ii)
FFIs with only low-value accounts.
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) if the FFI meets the following requirements:
(A) The FFI is not an investment entity.
(B) No financial account maintained by the FFI (or, in the case of an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group, by any member of the expanded affiliated group) has a balance or value in excess of $50,000. The balance or value of a financial account shall be determined by applying the rules described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, substituting the term
financial account
for the term
depository account
and the term
person
for the term
individual.
(C) The FFI does not have more than $50 million in assets on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent accounting year. In the case of an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group, the entire expanded affiliated group does not have more than $50 million in assets on its consolidated or combined balance sheet as of the end of its most recent accounting year.
(iii)
Sponsored, closely held investment vehicles.
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, an FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(iii) if it meets the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity and is not a QI, WP, or WT.
(B) A participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution agrees to fulfill all due diligence, withholding, and reporting responsibilities that the FFI would have assumed if it were a participating FFI.
(C) Twenty or fewer individuals own all of the debt and equity interests in the FFI (disregarding debt interests owned by U.S. financial institutions, participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, and certified deemed-compliant FFIs and equity interests owned by an entity if that entity owns 100 percent of the equity interests in the FFI and is itself a sponsored FFI under this paragraph (f)(2)(iii)).
(D) The sponsoring entity complies with the following requirements—
(
1
) The sponsoring entity has registered with the IRS as a sponsoring entity;
(
2
) The sponsoring entity agrees to perform, on behalf of the FFI, all due diligence, withholding, reporting, and other requirements that the FFI would have been required to perform if it were a participating FFI and retains documentation collected with respect to the FFI for a period of six years;
(

(
5
) The sponsoring entity has not had its status as a sponsor revoked.
(E) The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status as a sponsoring entity with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs based on the provisions of paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section (describing notice of event of default, remediation, and termination procedures) if there is an event of default as defined in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. A sponsoring entity is not liable for any failure to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D) of this section unless the sponsoring entity is a withholding agent that is separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. A sponsored FFI will remain liable for any failure of its sponsoring entity to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D) of this section that the sponsoring entity has agreed to undertake on behalf of the FFI, even if the sponsoring entity is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for the failure to withhold on or report with respect to a payment made by the sponsoring entity on behalf of the sponsored FFI. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.
(iv)
Limited life debt investment entities (transitional).
An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(iv) if the FFI is the beneficial owner of the payment (or of payments made with respect to the
account) and the FFI meets the following requirements.

(C) The FFI was formed and operated for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring specific types of debt instruments or interests therein and holding those assets subject to reinvestment only under prescribed circumstances to maturity.
(D) Substantially all of the assets of the FFI consist of debt instruments or interests therein (including assets acquired pursuant to a foreclosure, restructuring, workout, or similar event with respect to a debt instrument).
(E) All payments made to the investors of the FFI (other than holders of a de minimis interest) are either cleared through a clearing organization or custodial institution that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution or made through a transfer agent that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution.
(F) The FFI's trustee or fiduciary is not authorized through a fiduciary duty or otherwise to fulfill the obligations of a participating FFI under § 1.1471-4 and no other person has the authority to fulfill the obligations of a participating FFI under § 1.1471-4 on behalf of the FFI.

(3)
Owner-documented FFIs
—(i)
In general.
An owner-documented FFI means an FFI that meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. An FFI may only be treated as an owner-documented FFI with respect to payments received from and accounts held with a designated withholding agent (or with respect to payments received from and accounts held with another FFI that is also treated as an owner-documented FFI by such designated withholding agent). A designated withholding agent is a U.S. financial institution, participating FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI that agrees to undertake the additional due diligence and reporting required under paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section in order to treat the FFI as an owner-documented FFI. An FFI meeting the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3) will only be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI with respect to a payment or account for which it does not act as an intermediary.
(ii)
Requirements of owner-documented FFI status.
An FFI meets the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii) only if—
(A) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity;
(B) The FFI is not owned by or in an expanded affiliated group with any FFI that is a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company;
(C) The FFI does not maintain a financial account for any nonparticipating FFI;
(D) The FFI provides the designated withholding agent with all of the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(6) and agrees to notify the withholding agent if there is a change in circumstances; and
(E) The designated withholding agent agrees to report to the IRS (or, in the case of a reporting Model 1 FFI, to the relevant foreign government or agency thereof) all of the information described in § 1.1471-4(d) or § 1.1474-1(i) (as appropriate) with respect to any specified U.S. persons that are identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(
1
) and (
2
). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the designated withholding agent is
not required to report information with respect to an indirect owner of the FFI that holds its interest through a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI (other than an owner-documented FFI), an entity that is a U.S. person, an exempt beneficial owner, or an excepted NFFE.
(4)
Definition of a restricted distributor.
An entity is a restricted distributor for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D) of this section (relating to registered deemed-compliant restricted funds) if it operates as a distributor that holds debt or equity interests in a restricted fund as a nominee and meets the following requirements.
(i) The distributor provides investment services to at least 30 customers unrelated to each other and fewer than half of the distributor's customers are related to each other. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4)(i), customers are related to each other if they have a relationship with each other described in section 267(b).
(ii) The distributor is required to perform AML due diligence procedures under the anti-money laundering laws of its country of incorporation or organization (which must be a FATF-compliant jurisdiction).
(iii) The distributor operates solely in its country of incorporation or organization, does not have a fixed place of business outside that country, and, if such distributor belongs to an expanded affiliated group, has the same country of incorporation or organization as all other members of its expanded affiliated group. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.
(iv) The distributor does not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, a distributor will not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of organization merely because it operates a Web site, provided that the Web site does not permit account opening by persons identified as nonresidents, does not specifically state that nonresidents may acquire securities from the distributor, and does not otherwise target U.S. customers or account holders. A distributor will also not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not indicate that the distributor maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders.
(v) The distributor does not have more than $175 million in total assets under management and has no more than $7 million in gross revenue on its income statement for the most recent financial accounting year and, if the distributor belongs to an expanded affiliated group, the entire group does not have more than $500 million in total assets under management or more than $20 million in gross revenue for its most recent financial accounting year on a combined or consolidated income statement.
(vi) The distributor provides the restricted fund (or another distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and with which the distributor has entered into its distribution agreement) with a valid Form W-8 indicating that the distributor satisfies the requirements to be a restricted distributor.
(vii) The agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt or equity interests of the restricted fund—
(A) Prohibits the distributor from distributing any securities to specified U.S. persons, passive NFFEs that have one or more substantial U.S. owners, and nonparticipating FFIs;
(B) Requires that if the distributor does distribute securities to any of the persons described in this paragraph (f)(4)(vii), it will cause the restricted fund to redeem or retire those interests, or it will transfer those interests to a distributor that is a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI, within six months and the commission paid to
the distributor will be forfeited to the restricted fund or to the participating FFI to which those interests are transferred; and
(C) Requires the distributor to notify the restricted fund (or another distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or registered deemed-compliant FFI and with which the distributor has entered into its distribution agreement) of a change in the distributor's chapter 4 status within 90 days of the change in status.
(viii) With respect to sales after December 31, 2011, and prior to the time the restrictions described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this section were incorporated into the distribution agreement, either the agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt or equity interests of the relevant FFI contained a prohibition of the sale of such securities to U.S. entities or U.S. resident individuals, or the distributor reviews all accounts relating to such sales in accordance with the procedures (and time frames) described in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to preexisting accounts and certifies that it has caused the restricted fund to redeem or retire, or it has transferred all securities sold to any of the persons described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this section. If the distribution agreement addressed in the prior sentence contained only a prohibition on the sale of securities to U.S. resident individuals, the distributor will not be required to review the individual accounts relating to such sales but must review and make certifications with respect to all entity accounts in the manner described in the previous sentence.
(g)
Recalcitrant account holders
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (g) provides rules for determining when an account holder of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is a recalcitrant account holder. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section defines the term recalcitrant account holder. Paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section provide timing rules for when an account holder will begin to be treated as a recalcitrant account holder by a participating FFI and when an account holder will cease to be treated as a recalcitrant account holder by such institution. For rules for determining the holder of an account, see paragraph (a)(3) of this section. For the withholding requirements of an FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.1471-4(b). For the reporting requirements of an FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see § 1.1471-4(d)(6), and, for the reporting required with respect to payments made to such account holders, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person shall apply the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) (for foreign entity account holders) and chapter 3 or 61 (for individual payees) to determine the status of a payee if it cannot reliably associate a payment made to the payee with valid documentation and does not apply this paragraph (g).
(2)
Recalcitrant account holder.
The term
recalcitrant account holder
means any holder of an account maintained by an FFI if such account holder is not an FFI (or presumed to be an FFI under § 1.1471-3(f)), the account does not meet the requirements of the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section (for depository accounts with a balance of $50,000 or less) and does not qualify for any of the exceptions from the documentation requirements described in § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii), (c)(4)(iii), (c)(5)(iii), (c)(5)(iv)(E) (or the participating FFI elects to forego such exceptions) and—
(i) The account holder fails to comply with requests by the FFI for the documentation or information that is required under § 1.1471-4(c) for determining the status of such account as a U.S. account or other than a U.S. account;
(ii) The account holder fails to provide a valid Form W-9 upon request from the FFI or fails to provide a correct name and TIN combination upon request from the FFI when the FFI has received notice from the IRS indicating that the name and TIN combination reported by the FFI for the account holder is incorrect;
(iii) If foreign law would (but for a waiver) prevent reporting by the FFI (or branch or division thereof) of the information described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (5) with respect to such account, the account holder (or substantial U.S.
owner of an account holder that is a U.S. owned foreign entity) fails to provide a valid and effective waiver to permit such reporting; or
(iv) The account holder provides the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(12) to establish its status as a passive NFFE (other than a WP or WT) but fails to provide the information regarding its owners required under § 1.1471-3(d)(12)(iii).

Accounts other than high-value accounts.
Account holders of preexisting accounts maintained by a participating FFI that are not high-value accounts (as described in § 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(D)) and that are described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as recalcitrant account holders beginning on the date that is two years after the effective date of the FFI agreement.
(C)
High-value accounts.
Account holders of preexisting accounts maintained by a participating FFI that are high-value accounts (as described in § 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(D)) and that are described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as recalcitrant account holders beginning on the date that is one year after the effective date of the FFI agreement.
(D)
Preexisting accounts that become high-value accounts.
With respect to a calendar year beginning after December 31, 2015, an account holder that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and that holds a preexisting account that a participating FFI identifies as a high-value account pursuant to § 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(D) will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the earlier of the date a withholdable payment is made to the account following end of the calendar year in which the account is identified as a high-value account or the date that is six months after the calendar year end.

An account holder of an account other than a preexisting account and that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the date that is the earlier of 90 days after the account is opened by the participating FFI or the date that a withholdable payment that is subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a) is made to the account. An account holder for which the participating FFI received a notice from the IRS indicating that the name and TIN combination provided for the account holder is incorrect will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder following the date of such notice within the time prescribed in § 31.3406(d)-5(a) of this chapter.
(iii)
Accounts with changes in circumstances.
An account holder holding an account that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section following a change in circumstances (other than a change in account balance or value in a subsequent year that causes an individual account to be identified as a high-value account) will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the date that is 90 days after the change in circumstances. For the definition of a change in circumstances with respect to an account, see § 1.1471-4(c)(2)(iii).
(4)
End of recalcitrant account holder status.
An account holder that is treated as a recalcitrant account holder under paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section will cease to be so treated as of the date on which the account holder is no longer described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

Expanded affiliated group
—(1)
Scope of paragraph.
This paragraph (i) defines the term
expanded affiliated group
for purposes of chapter 4. For the requirements of a participating FFI with respect to members of its expanded affiliated group that are FFIs, see § 1.1471-4(e).
(2)
Expanded affiliated group defined.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i), an expanded affiliated group is defined in accordance with the principles of section 1504(a) to mean one or more chains of members connected through ownership by a common parent entity if the common parent entity directly owns stock or other equity interests meeting the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section in at least one of the other members (for purposes of this paragraph (i), the constructive ownership rules of section 318 do not apply). Generally, only a corporation shall be treated as the common parent entity of an expanded affiliated group, unless the taxpayer elects to follow the approach described in paragraph (i)(10) of this section.
(3)
Member of an expanded affiliated group.
The term
member of an expanded affiliated group
means a corporation or any entity other than a corporation (such as a partnership or trust) with respect to which the ownership requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section are met, regardless of whether such entity is a U.S. person or a foreign person, but excluding corporations described in paragraphs (1), (4), (6), (7), or (8) of section 1504(b).
(4)
Ownership test.
The ownership requirements of this paragraph (i)(4) are met if—
(i)
Corporations.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, a corporation (except the common parent entity) will be considered owned by another member entity or by the common parent entity if more than 50 percent of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation and more than 50 percent of the total value of the stock of such corporation is owned directly by one or more other members of the group (including the common parent entity).
(A)
Stock not to include certain preferred stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), the term
stock
does not include any stock which is described in section 1504(a)(4).
(B)
Valuation.
For purposes of section 1471(e) and this section, all shares of stock within a single class are considered to have the same value in determining the ownership percentage. Thus, control premiums and minority blockage discounts within a single class are not taken into account.
(ii)
Partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, a partnership will be considered owned by another member entity (including the common parent entity) if more than 50 percent (by value) of the capital or profits interest in the partnership is owned directly by one or more other members of the group (including the common parent entity).
(iii)
Trusts.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, a trust will be considered owned by another member entity or by the common parent entity if more than 50 percent (by value) of the beneficial interest in such trust is owned directly by one or more other members of the group (including the common parent entity). A beneficial interest in a trust includes an interest held by an entity treated as a grantor or other owner of the trust under sections 671 through 679 and a beneficial trust interest.
(5)
Treatment of warrants, options, and obligations convertible into equity for determining ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(4) of this section, ownership of warrants, options, obligations convertible into the equity of a corporation or entity other than a corporation, and other similar interests is not considered for purposes of determining whether an entity is a member of an expanded affiliated group, except as follows:
(i) Ownership of a warrant, option, obligation convertible into stock, or other similar instrument creating an interest in a corporation will be considered for purposes of paragraph (i)(4) of this section to the extent that the
common parent or member of the expanded affiliated group that holds such instrument also maintains voting rights with respect to such corporation. However, interests described in § 1.1504-4(d)(2) will not be treated as options.
(ii) Ownership of a warrant, option, obligation convertible into an equity interest, or other similar instrument creating an interest in a corporation or entity other than a corporation will be considered for purposes of paragraph (i)(4) of this section to the extent that such instrument is reasonably certain to be exercised, based on all of the facts and circumstances and in accordance with the principles set forth in § 1.1504-4(g).
(6)
Exception for FFIs holding certain capital investments.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(4) of this section, an investment entity will not be considered a member of an expanded affiliated group as a result of a contribution of seed capital by a member of such expanded affiliated group if—
(i) The member that owns the investment entity is an FFI that is in the business of providing seed capital to form investment entities, the interests in which it intends to sell to investors that do not have a relationship with each other described in section 267(b);
(ii) The investment entity is created in the ordinary course of such other FFI's business described in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section;
(iii) As of the date the FFI acquired the equity interest, any equity interest in the investment entity in excess of 50 percent of the total value of the stock of the investment entity is intended to be held by such other FFI (including ownership by other members of such other FFI's expanded affiliated group) for no more than three years from the date on which such other FFI first acquired an equity interest in the investment entity; and
(iv) In the case of an equity interest that has been held by such other FFI for over three years from the date referenced in paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of the equity interest held by such other FFI and the equity interests held by other members of its expanded affiliated group is 50 percent or less of the total value of the stock of the investment entity.
(7)
Seed capital.
For purposes of this paragraph (i), the term
seed capital
means an initial capital contribution made to an investment entity that is intended as a temporary investment and is deemed by the manager of the entity to be necessary or appropriate for the establishment of the entity, such as for the purpose of establishing a track record of investment performance for such entity, achieving economies of scale for diversified investment, avoiding an artificially high expense to return ratio, or similar purposes.
(8)
Anti-abuse rule.
A change in ownership, voting rights, or the form of an entity that results in an entity meeting or not meeting the ownership requirements described in paragraph (i)(4) of this section will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether an entity is a member of an expanded affiliated group if the change is pursuant to a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid reporting or withholding that would otherwise be required under any chapter 4 provision. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(8), a change in voting rights includes a separation of voting rights and value.
(9)
Exception for limited life debt investment entities.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (i)(2) and (4) of this section, an entity that meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, including the requirements to have been in existence as of January 17, 2013, and to have issued interests in the entity on or before January 17, 2013, will not be considered a member of an expanded affiliated group as a result of any member of such expanded affiliated group owning interests in such entity.
(10)
Partnerships, trusts, and other non-corporate entities.
For purposes of determining the composition of an expanded affiliated group, an entity other than a corporation may elect to be treated as the common parent entity. Taxpayers following this approach may not, in a later year, follow the rule described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section without the approval of the Commissioner. See also paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
(j)
Sponsoring entity verification
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (j) describes the requirements for a sponsoring entity of a sponsored FFI to establish and implement a compliance program for satisfying its requirements as a sponsoring entity and to provide a certification of compliance with its requirements. This paragraph (j) also describes the procedures for the IRS to review the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to each sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA. For purposes of a sponsoring entity's certification of compliance under this paragraph (j), a sponsoring entity must have in place a written sponsorship agreement described in paragraph (j)(6) of this section with each sponsored FFI. See paragraph (j)(3)(v)(B) of this section for the certification regarding a sponsoring entity's sponsorship agreement with each sponsored FFI.
(2)
Compliance program.
The sponsoring entity must appoint a responsible officer to oversee the compliance of the sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA. The responsible officer must (either personally or through designated persons) establish a compliance program that includes policies, procedures, and processes sufficient for the sponsoring entity to satisfy the requirements described in the preceding sentence. The responsible officer (or designee) must periodically review the sufficiency of the sponsoring entity's compliance program, the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to each sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA, and the compliance of each sponsored FFI with the due diligence, withholding, and reporting requirements of § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA during the certification period described in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section. The results of the periodic review must be considered by the responsible officer in making the periodic certifications described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(3)
Certification of compliance
—(i)
Certification requirement
—(A)
In general.
In addition to the certification required under paragraph (j)(5) of this section (preexisting account certification), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) or (j)(3)(ii) of this section, on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the certification period, the responsible officer of the sponsoring entity must make the certification described in paragraph (j)(3)(v) of this section and either the certification described in paragraph (j)(3)(vi)(A) of this section or the certification described in paragraph (j)(3)(vi)(B) of this section with respect to all sponsored FFIs for which the sponsoring entity acts during the certification period on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. To the extent that a sponsoring entity satisfies the certification requirements of paragraph (j)(3) of this section on behalf of a sponsored FFI, the sponsored FFI does not have a certification requirement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Extension of time for the certification period ending on December 31, 2017.
The certifications required for a certification period ending on December 31, 2017, must be submitted on or before March 31, 2019.
(ii)
Late-joining sponsored FFIs.
In general, with respect to a certification period, a sponsoring entity is not required to make a certification for a sponsored FFI that first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity during the six-month period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes certifications for such sponsored FFI for subsequent certification periods and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the sponsoring entity during which such FFI was sponsored by the sponsoring entity. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a sponsored FFI that, immediately before the FFI agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or
sponsored, closely held investment vehicle of another sponsoring entity. The sponsoring entity may certify for a sponsored FFI described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the sponsoring entity before the date that the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity if the sponsoring entity obtains from the FFI (or the FFI's sponsoring entity, if applicable) a written certification that the FFI has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: the sponsoring entity does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the sponsored FFI for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which such FFI was sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
(iii)
Certification period.
The first certification period of a sponsoring entity begins on the later of the date the sponsoring entity is issued a GIIN to act as a sponsoring entity or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following such date. Each subsequent certification period is the three-calendar-year period following the previous certification period.
(iv)
Additional certifications or information.
The certification of compliance described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section may be modified to include additional certifications or information (such as quantitative or factual information related to the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to each sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA), provided that such additional information or certifications are published at least 90 days before being made effective in order to allow for public comment.
(v)
Certifications regarding sponsoring entity and sponsored FFI requirements.
The responsible officer of the sponsoring entity must certify to the following statements—
(A) The sponsoring entity meets all of the requirements of a sponsoring entity as described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
) or (f)(2)(iii)(D) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA, including the chapter 4 status required of such entity;
(B) The sponsoring entity has a written sponsorship agreement in effect with each sponsored FFI authorizing the sponsoring entity to fulfill the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to each sponsored FFI; and
(C) Each sponsored FFI treated as a sponsored investment entity, a sponsored controlled foreign corporation, or a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle by the sponsoring entity meets the requirements of its respective status.
(vi)
Certifications regarding internal controls
—(A)
Certification of effective internal controls.
The responsible officer of the sponsoring entity must certify to the following statements—
(
1
) The responsible officer of the sponsoring entity has established a compliance program that is in effect as of the date of the certification and that has been subject to the review as described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section;
(
2
) With respect to material failures (defined in paragraph (j)(3)(vii) of this section)—
(
i
) There are no material failures for the certification period; or
(
ii
) If there were any material failures, appropriate actions were taken to remediate such failures and to prevent such failures from reoccurring; and
(
3
) With respect to any failure to withhold, deposit, or report to the extent required under § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to any sponsored FFI for any year during the certification period, the sponsored FFI has corrected such failure by paying (or directing the sponsoring entity to pay) any taxes due (including interest and penalties) and filing (or directing the sponsoring entity to file) the appropriate return (or amended return).
(B)
Qualified certification.
If the responsible officer of the sponsoring entity has identified an event of default (defined in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) or a material failure (defined in paragraph (j)(3)(vii) of this section)
that the sponsoring entity has not corrected as of the date of the certification, the responsible officer must certify to the following statements—
(
1
) The responsible officer of the sponsoring entity has established a compliance program that is in effect as of the date of the certification and that has been subjected to the review as described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section;
(
2
) With respect to the event of default or material failure—
(
i
) The responsible officer (or designee) has identified an event of default; or
(
ii
) The responsible officer has determined that there are one or more material failures as defined in paragraph (j)(3)(vii) of this section and that appropriate actions will be taken to prevent such failures from reoccurring;
(
3
) With respect to any failure to withhold, deposit, or report to the extent required under § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to any sponsored FFI for any year during the certification period, the sponsored FFI will correct such failure by paying (or directing the sponsoring entity to pay) any taxes due (including interest and penalties) and filing (or directing the sponsoring entity to file) the appropriate return (or amended return); and
(
4
) The responsible officer (or designee) will respond to any notice of default under paragraph (k)(2) of this section or will provide to the IRS a description of each material failure and a written plan to correct each such failure when requested under paragraph (j)(4) of this section.
(vii)
Material failures defined.
A material failure is a failure of the sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored FFI to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA if the failure was the result of a deliberate action on the part of one or more employees of the sponsoring entity or was an error attributable to a failure of the sponsoring entity to implement internal controls sufficient for the sponsoring entity to meet its requirements. A material failure will not constitute an event of default unless such material failure occurs in more than limited circumstances when a sponsoring entity has not substantially complied with the requirements described in the preceding sentence. Material failures include the following—
(A) With respect to any sponsored FFI, the deliberate or systematic failure of the sponsoring entity to report accounts that such sponsored FFI was required to treat as U.S. accounts, withhold on passthru payments to the extent required, deposit taxes withheld to the extent required, accurately report recalcitrant account holders (or non-consenting U.S. accounts under an applicable Model 2 IGA), or accurately report with respect to nonparticipating FFIs as required under § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F) or an applicable Model 2 IGA;
(B) A criminal or civil penalty or sanction imposed on the sponsoring entity or any sponsored FFI (or any branch or office of the sponsoring entity or any sponsored FFI) by a regulator or other governmental authority or agency with oversight over the sponsoring entity's or sponsored FFI's compliance with the AML due diligence procedures to which it (or any branch or office thereof) is subject and that is imposed based on a failure to properly identify account holders under the requirements of those procedures;
(C) A potential future tax liability of any sponsored FFI related to its compliance (or lack thereof) with the due diligence, withholding, and reporting requirements of § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA for which such sponsored FFI has established, for financial statement purposes, a tax reserve or provision;
(D) A potential contractual liability under the agreement described in paragraph (j)(3)(v)(B) of this section of the sponsoring entity to any sponsored FFI related to such sponsoring entity's compliance (or lack thereof) with paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA for which the sponsoring entity has established, for financial statement purposes, a reserve or provision; and
(E) Failure to register with the IRS as a sponsoring entity or to register each sponsored FFI required to be registered under paragraph
(f)(1)(i)(F)(
3
)(
iii
) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA.
(4)
IRS review of compliance
—(i)
General inquiries.
The IRS, based upon the information reporting forms described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) filed with the IRS (or the absence of such reporting) by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsoring FFI, may request additional information with respect to the information reported (or required to be reported) on the forms, the account statements described in § 1.1471-4(d)(4)(v) with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs, or confirmation that the FFI has no reporting requirements. The IRS may also request any additional information from the sponsoring entity (including a copy of each sponsorship agreement the sponsoring entity has entered into with each sponsored FFI) necessary to determine the compliance with the due diligence, withholding, and reporting requirements of § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to each sponsored FFI and to assist the IRS with its review of account holder compliance with tax reporting requirements.
(ii)
Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.
The IRS may determine in its discretion that a sponsoring entity may not have substantially complied with the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to any sponsored FFI. This determination is based on the information reporting forms described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) filed with the IRS by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsored FFI (or the absence of reporting), the certifications made by the responsible officer described in paragraphs (j)(3) and (5) of this section (or the absence of such certifications), or any other information related to the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to any sponsored FFI for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer (or designee) information necessary to verify the sponsoring entity's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may request, for example, a description or copy of the sponsoring entity's policies and procedures for fulfilling the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA, a description or copy of the sponsoring entity's procedures for conducting its periodic review, or a copy of any written reports documenting the findings of such review. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the facts and circumstances surrounding the sponsoring entity's potential failure to comply with respect to each sponsored FFI with the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F) or (f)(2)(iii) of this section or an applicable Model 2 IGA.
(iii)
Compliance procedures for a sponsored FFI subject to a Model 2 IGA.
In the case of a sponsored FFI subject to the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA, the procedures described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section apply, except as otherwise provided in the applicable Model 2 IGA.
(5)
Preexisting account certification.
The responsible officer of a sponsoring entity must make the certification described in § 1.1471-4(c)(7) (preexisting account certification of a participating FFI) with respect to each sponsored FFI that enters into the sponsorship agreement with the sponsoring entity during the certification period (as defined in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section). However, the preexisting account certification is not required for a sponsored FFI that, immediately before the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a participating FFI, a sponsored FFI of another sponsoring entity, or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a local FFI or a restricted fund, if the FFI (or the FFI's former sponsoring entity, if applicable) provides a written certification to the sponsoring entity that the FFI has made the preexisting account certification required under § 1.1471-4(c)(7) or paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A)(
7
) or (f)(1)(i)(D)(
6
) of this section (as applicable), unless the sponsoring entity knows that such written certification is unreliable or
incorrect. In addition, the preexisting account certification is not required for a sponsored FFI that enters into the sponsorship agreement with the sponsoring entity during the two year period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes the preexisting account certification for such FFI for the subsequent certification period. The certification described in this paragraph (j)(5) for the certification period must be submitted by the due date of the sponsoring entity's certification of compliance required under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section for the certification period (or the extended due date described in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section for the certification period ending on December 31, 2017), on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. With respect to a sponsored FFI for which the sponsoring entity makes a preexisting account certification, a preexisting obligation means any account, instrument, or contract (including any debt or equity interest) maintained, executed, or issued by the sponsored FFI that is outstanding on the earlier of the date the FFI is issued a GIIN as a sponsored FFI or the date the FFI first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
(6)
Sponsorship agreement.
A sponsoring entity must have a written sponsorship agreement (which may be part of another agreement between the sponsoring entity and the sponsored FFI) that refers to the requirements of a sponsored FFI under FATCA and that must be in place with each sponsored FFI for which the sponsoring entity acts by the later of March 31, 2019, or the date that the sponsoring entity begins acting as a sponsoring entity for the applicable sponsored FFI.
(k)
Sponsoring entity event of default
—(1)
Defined.
An event of default with regard to a sponsoring entity occurs if the sponsoring entity fails to perform material obligations required with respect to the due diligence, withholding, and reporting requirements of § 1.1471-4 or an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to any sponsored FFI, to establish or maintain a compliance program as described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, or to perform a periodic review described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. An event of default also includes the occurrence of any of the following—
(i) With respect to any sponsored FFI, failure to obtain, in any case in which foreign law would (but for a waiver) prevent the reporting of U.S. accounts required under § 1.1471-4(d), valid and effective waivers from holders of U.S. accounts or failure to otherwise close or transfer such U.S. accounts as required under § 1.1471-4(i);
(ii) With respect to any sponsored FFI, failure to significantly reduce, over a period of time, the number of account holders or payees that such sponsored FFI is required to treat as recalcitrant account holders or nonparticipating FFIs, as a result of the sponsoring entity failing to comply with the due diligence procedures set forth in § 1.1471-4(c);
(iii) With respect to any sponsored FFI, failure to fulfill the requirements of § 1.1471-4(i) in any case in which foreign law prevents or otherwise limits withholding under § 1.1471-4(b);
(iv) Failure to take timely corrective actions to remedy a material failure described in paragraph (j)(3)(vii) of this section after making a qualified certification described in paragraph (j)(3)(vi)(B) of this section;
(v) Failure to make the preexisting account certification required under paragraph (j)(5) of this section or the periodic certification required under paragraph (j)(3) of this section with respect to any sponsored FFI within the specified time period;
(vi) Making incorrect claims for refund on behalf of any sponsored FFI;
(vii) Failure to cooperate with an IRS request for additional information under paragraph (j)(4) of this section;
(viii) Making any fraudulent statement or misrepresentation of material fact to the IRS or representing to a withholding agent or the IRS its status as a sponsoring entity for an entity other than an entity for which it acts as a sponsoring entity;
(ix) The sponsoring entity is no longer authorized to perform the requirements of a sponsoring entity with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs; or
(x) Failure to have the written sponsorship agreement described in paragraph (j)(3)(v)(B) of this section in effect with each sponsored FFI.
(2)
Notice of event of default.
Following an event of default known by or disclosed by the sponsoring entity to the IRS, the IRS will deliver to the sponsoring entity a notice of default specifying the event of default and, if applicable, identifying each sponsored FFI to which the notice relates. The IRS will request that the sponsoring entity remediate the event of default within 45 days (unless additional time is requested and agreed to by the IRS). The sponsoring entity must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the sponsoring entity does not agree that an event of default has occurred.
(3)
Remediation of event of default.
A sponsoring entity will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent that it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. Such a plan may, for example, allow a sponsoring entity to remediate an event of default described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section with respect to a sponsored FFI by providing specific information regarding the U.S. accounts maintained by such sponsored FFI when the sponsoring entity has been unable to report all of the information with respect to such accounts as required under § 1.1471-4(d) and has been unable to close or transfer such accounts. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the sponsoring entity or the performance of the specified review procedures described in paragraph (j)(4)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Termination
—(i)
In general.
If the sponsoring entity does not provide a response to a notice of default within the period specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section or does not remediate the event of default as described in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, the IRS may deliver a notice of termination that terminates the sponsoring entity's status, the status of one or more sponsored FFIs as deemed-compliant FFIs, or the status of both the sponsoring entity and one or more sponsored FFIs.
(ii)
Termination of sponsoring entity.
If the IRS terminates the status of the sponsoring entity, the sponsoring entity must send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each sponsored FFI for which it acts, as well as to each withholding agent from which each sponsored FFI receives payments and each financial institution with which each sponsored FFI holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided. A sponsoring entity that has had its status terminated cannot register on the FATCA registration website to act as a sponsoring entity for any sponsored FFI or for any entity that is a sponsored entity under a Model 1 IGA unless it receives written approval from the IRS to register. Unless the status of a sponsored FFI has been terminated, the sponsored FFI may register on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (as applicable). However, a sponsored FFI whose sponsoring entity has been terminated may not register or represent its status as a sponsored FFI of a sponsoring entity that has a relationship described in section 267(b) or 707(b) with the sponsoring entity that was terminated without receiving written approval from the IRS.
(iii)
Termination of sponsored FFI.
If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that the status of a sponsored FFI is terminated (but not the sponsoring entity's status), the sponsoring entity must remove the sponsored FFI from the sponsoring entity's registration account on the FATCA registration website and send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which the sponsored FFI receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided with respect to such sponsored FFI. A sponsored FFI that has had its status as a sponsored FFI terminated (independent from a termination of status of its sponsoring entity) may not register on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI unless it
receives written approval from the IRS.
(iv)
Reconsideration of notice of default or notice of termination.
A sponsoring entity or sponsored FFI may request, within 90 days of a notice of default or notice of termination, reconsideration of the notice of default or notice of termination by written request to the IRS.
(v)
Sponsoring entity of sponsored FFIs subject to a Model 2 IGA.
Subject to the provisions of an applicable Model 2 IGA, the IRS may revoke the status of a sponsoring entity with respect to one or more sponsored FFIs subject to a Model 2 IGA based on the provisions of paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section (describing notice of event of default and termination procedures) if there is an event of default as defined in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
(l)
Trustee-documented trust verification
—(1)
Compliance program.
A trustee of a trust treated as a trustee-documented trust under an applicable Model 2 IGA must establish and implement a compliance program for purposes of satisfying the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to each such trust. The trustee must appoint a responsible officer who must (either personally or through designated persons) establish policies, procedures, and processes sufficient for the trustee to implement the compliance program. The responsible officer (or designee) must periodically review the sufficiency of the trustee's compliance program and the trustee's compliance with respect to each trust for purposes of satisfying the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA for each certification period described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. The results of the periodic review must be considered by the responsible officer in making the certification described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
(2)
Certification of compliance
—(i)
Certification requirement
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (I)(2)(i)(B) or (I)(2)(ii) of this section, on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of the certification period, the responsible officer of the trustee must make a certification for the certification period with respect to all trustee-documented trusts described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS.
(B)
Extension of time for the certification period ending on December 31, 2017.
The certifications required for a certification period ending on December 31, 2017, must be submitted on or before March 31, 2019.
(ii)
Late-joining trustee-documented trusts.
In general, with respect to a certification period, the responsible officer of a trustee is not required to make a certification for a trustee-documented trust for which the trustee first agreed to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA during the six-month period before the end of the trustee's certification period, provided that the responsible officer of the trustee makes certifications for such trustee-documented trust for subsequent certification periods and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the trustee during which the trustee acted as the trustee of the trustee-documented trust. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a trustee-documented trust that, immediately before the trustee first agrees to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA, was a trustee-documented trust of another trustee. The trustee of a trustee-documented trust may certify for a trustee-documented trust described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the trustee before the date that the trustee first agrees to act as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA if the trustee obtains from the trustee-documented trust (or the trust's former trustee, if applicable) a written certification that the trust has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The trustee does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the trustee-documented trust for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which the trustee acts as the trustee under Annex II of an applicable IGA.
(iii)
Certification period.
The first certification period of the trustee begins on the later of the date the trustee is issued a GIIN to act as a trustee of a trustee-documented trust or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following such date. Each subsequent certification period is the three-calendar-year period following the previous certification period.
(iv)
Certifications.
The responsible officer of the trustee must certify to the following statements—
(A) The responsible officer of the trustee has established a compliance program that is in effect as of the date of the certification and has performed a periodic review described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section for the certification period; and
(B) The trustee has reported to the IRS on Form 8966, “FATCA Report” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe), all of the information required to be reported pursuant to the applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to all U.S. accounts of each trustee-documented trust for which the trustee acts during the certification period by the due date of Form 8966 (including extensions) for each year.
(3)
IRS review of compliance by trustees of trustee-documented trusts
—(i)
General inquiries.
Based upon the information reporting forms filed with the IRS (or the absence of such reporting) by a trustee with respect to any trustee-documented trust subject to a Model 2 IGA for each calendar year, and subject to the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA, the IRS may request from the trustee additional information with respect to the information reported on the forms with respect to any trustee-documented trust or a confirmation that the trustee has no reporting requirements with respect to any trustee-documented trust. The IRS may also request any additional information to determine the trustee's compliance for purposes of satisfying the trust's requirements as a trustee-documented trust under an applicable Model 2 IGA or to assist the IRS with its review of account holder compliance with tax reporting requirements.
(ii)
Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.
The IRS may determine in its discretion that the trustee may not have substantially complied with the requirements applicable to a trustee of a trustee-documented trust. This determination is based on the information reporting forms filed with the IRS by a trustee with respect to any trustee-documented trust subject to a Model 2 IGA for each calendar year (or the absence of such reporting), the certification described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section (or the absence of such certification), or any other information related to the trustee's compliance with respect to any trustee-documented trust for purposes of satisfying the trust's applicable Model 2 IGA requirements. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer information necessary to verify the trustee's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the circumstances surrounding the trustee's potential failure to comply with the requirements of an applicable Model 2 IGA with respect to one or more trustee-documented trusts. The IRS may notify the applicable Model 2 IGA jurisdiction that the trustee has not complied with its requirements as a trustee of one or more trustee-documented trusts.

In addition, an exempt beneficial owner includes any person treated as an exempt beneficial owner pursuant to a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA. See §§ 1.1471-2(a)(4)(v) and 1.1472-1(c)(2) for the exemptions from withholding for payments beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner; § 1.1471-3(d)(9) for the documentation requirements applicable to a withholding agent for purposes of determining when a withholdable payment is beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner; and § 1.1471-3(d)(8)(ii) for when a withholding agent may treat a payment made to a nonparticipating FFI as beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner.
(b)
Any foreign government, any political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.
Solely for purposes of this section and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the term
any foreign government, any political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing

integral part
of a foreign sovereign is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion inuring to the benefit of any private person as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. An integral part does not include any individual who is a sovereign, official, or administrator acting in a private or personal capacity. All the facts and circumstances will be taken into account in determining whether an individual is acting in a private or personal capacity.
(2)
Controlled entity.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (b), a
controlled entity

(iii) The entity's assets vest in one or more foreign sovereigns upon dissolution.
(3)
Inurement to the benefit of private persons.

(f)
Certain retirement funds.
A fund is described in this paragraph (f) if it is described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) of this section. In addition, if a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as made to a payee that is a retirement fund in accordance with § 1.1471-3, then the withholding agent may also treat such retirement fund as the beneficial owner of the payment. See § 1.1471-3(d)(9)(ii).

FP is a resident of Country X under Article 4(2)(a) and a qualified person under Article 22(2)(d) of the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty. Therefore, FP is a pension fund described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(g)
Entities wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners.
A person is described in this paragraph (g) if it is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity, each direct holder of an equity interest in the investment entity is an exempt beneficial owner described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section or an exempt beneficial owner described in an applicable Model 1 or Model 2 IGA, and each direct holder of a debt interest in the investment entity is either a depository institution (with respect to a loan made to such entity), an exempt beneficial owner described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section, or an exempt beneficial owner described in an applicable Model 1 or Model 2 IGA.
(h)
Exception for commercial activities
—(1)
General rule.
An exempt beneficial owner described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section will not be treated as an exempt beneficial owner with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by an insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution (including the accepting of deposits). Thus, for example, a central bank of issue that conducts a commercial financial activity, such as acting as an intermediary on behalf of persons other than in the bank's capacity as a central bank of issue, is not an exempt beneficial owner under paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to payments received in connection with an account held in connection with such activity.
(2)
Limitation.
Paragraph (h)(1) of this section will not apply to treat an exempt beneficial owner as engaged in a commercial financial activity if—
(i) The entity undertakes commercial financial activity described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section solely for or at the direction of other exempt beneficial owners and such commercial financial activity is consistent with the purposes of the entity;
(ii) The entity has no outstanding debt that would be a financial account under § 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iii); and
(iii) The entity otherwise maintains financial accounts only for exempt beneficial owners, or, in the case of a foreign central bank of issue as described in paragraph (d), the entity only maintains financial accounts that are depository accounts for current or former employees of the entity (and the spouses and children of such employees) or financial accounts for exempt beneficial owners.
(i)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on January 6, 2017. However, taxpayers may apply these provisions as of January 28, 2013. (For the rules that apply beginning on January 28, 2013, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2016.)
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5976, Jan. 28, 2013; 78 FR 55208, Sept. 10, 2013, as amended by T.D. 9657, 79 FR 12857, Mar. 6, 2014; T.D. 9809, 82 FR 2183, Jan. 6, 2017]
§ 1.1472-1
Withholding on NFFEs.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules that a withholding agent must apply to determine its obligations to withhold under section 1472 on withholdable payments made to a payee that is a NFFE. A participating FFI that complies with its withholding obligations under § 1.1471-4(b) will be deemed to satisfy its obligations under section 1472 with respect to withholdable payments made to NFFEs that are account holders. The rules of this section will apply, however, in the case of a participating FFI acting as a withholding agent with respect to a payment made to a NFFE that is not an account holder (for example, a payment with respect to a contract that does not constitute a financial account). See § 1.1473-1(a)(4)(vi), however, for rules excepting from the definition of withholdable payment certain payments of U.S. source FDAP income made prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to an offshore obligation and § 1.1471-2(b) for rules excepting from the definition of withholdable payment a grandfathered obligation. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) for special rules of withholding that apply for purposes of this section and § 1.1471-2(a)(5) for withholding requirements if the source or character of a payment is unknown. The following entities are deemed to satisfy their withholding obligations under section 1472: Exempt beneficial owners; section 501(c) entities described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(v); and nonprofit organizations described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(vi). See § 1.1471-5(f) for when a deemed-compliant FFI is deemed to satisfy its withholding obligations with respect to payments made to NFFEs that are account holders under section 1472.
(b)
Withholdable payments made to an NFFE
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (providing transitional relief) or paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section (providing exceptions for payments to an excepted NFFE or an exempt beneficial owner), § 1.1471-2(a)(4)(i) (providing an exception to withholding if the withholding agent lacks control, custody, or knowledge), § 1.1471-2(a)(4)(vii) (providing an exception to withholding for payments made to an account held with or equity interests traded through a clearing organization with FATCA-compliant membership), or § 1.1471-2(a)(4)(viii) (providing an exception to withholding for payments to certain excepted accounts), a withholding agent must withhold 30 percent of any withholdable payment made after June 30, 2014, to a payee that is a NFFE unless—
(i) The beneficial owner of such payment is the NFFE or any other NFFE;
(ii) The withholding agent can, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, treat the beneficial owner of the payment as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners, or as an NFFE that has identified its substantial U.S. owners; and
(iii) The withholding agent reports the information described in § 1.1474-1(i)(2) relating to any substantial U.S. owners of the beneficial owner of such payment.
(2)
Transitional relief.
For any withholdable payment made prior to July 1, 2016, with respect to a preexisting obligation to a payee that is not a prima facie FFI and for which a withholding agent does not have documentation indicating the payee's status as a passive NFFE when the NFFE has failed to provide the owner certification as required under § 1.1471-3(d)(12)(iii), the withholding agent is not required to withhold under this section or report under § 1.1474-1(i)(2) (describing the reporting obligations of withholding agents with respect to NFFEs).
(c)
Exceptions
—(1)
Payments to an excepted NFFE.
A withholding agent is not required to withhold under section 1472(a) and paragraph (b) of this section on a withholdable payment (or portion thereof) if the withholding agent can treat the payment as made to a payee that is an excepted NFFE. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
excepted NFFE
means a payee that the withholding agent may treat as a NFFE that is a QI, WP, or WT. Additionally, the term
excepted NFFE
means, with respect to the payment, a NFFE described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section to the extent the withholding agent may treat the NFFE as the beneficial owner of the payment.
(i)
Publicly traded corporation.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(i) if it is a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets for the calendar year.
(A)
Regularly traded.
For purposes of this section, stock of a corporation is
regularly traded
on one or more established securities markets for a calendar year if—
(
1
) One or more classes of stock of the corporation that, in the aggregate, represent more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote and of the total value of the stock of such corporation are listed on such market or markets during the prior calendar year; and
(
2
) With respect to each class relied on to meet the more-than-50-percent listing requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section—
(
i
) Trades in each such class are effected, other than in de minimis quantities, on such market or markets on at least 60 days during the prior calendar year; and
(
ii
) The aggregate number of shares in each such class that are traded on such market or markets during the prior year are at least 10 percent of the average number of shares outstanding in that class during the prior calendar year.
(B)
Special rules regarding the regularly traded requirement
—(
1
)
Year of initial public offering.
For the calendar year in which a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock for trading on one or more established securities markets, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, such class of stock meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) for such year if the stock is regularly traded in more than de minimis quantities on
1/6
of the days remaining after the date of the offering in the quarter during which the offering occurs, and on at least 15 days during each remaining quarter of the calendar year. If a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, such class of stock meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) in the calendar year of the offering if the stock is regularly traded on such established securities market, other than in de minimis quantities, on the greater of
1/6
of the days remaining after the date of the offering in the quarter during which the offering occurs, or 5 days.
(
2
)
Classes of stock treated as meeting the regularly traded requirement.
A class of stock meets the trading requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) for a calendar year if the stock is traded during such year on an established securities market located in the United States and is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in the stock. A dealer makes a market in a stock only if the dealer regularly and actively offers to, and in fact does, purchase the stock from, and sell the stock to, customers who are not related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the dealer in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
(
3
)
Anti-abuse rule.
Any trade conducted with a principal purpose of meeting the regularly traded requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) shall be disregarded. Further, a class of stock shall not be treated as regularly traded if there is a pattern of trades conducted to meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i). Similarly, paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section shall not apply to a public offering of stock that has as one of its principal purposes qualification of the class of stock as regularly traded under the reduced regularly traded requirements for the calendar year of an initial public offering. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, consideration will be given to whether the regularly traded requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) are satisfied in the calendar year immediately following the initial public offering.
(C)
Established securities market
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i), the term
established securities market
means, for any calendar year—
(
i
) A foreign securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by a governmental authority of the foreign country in which the market is located, and has an annual value of shares traded on the exchange (or a predecessor exchange) exceeding $1 billion during each of the three calendar years immediately preceding the
calendar year in which the determination is being made;
(
ii
) A national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

(
iv
) Any other exchange that the Secretary may designate in published guidance.
(
2
)
Foreign exchange with multiple tiers.
If an exchange in a foreign country has more than one tier or market level on which stock may be separately listed or traded, each such tier shall be treated as a separate exchange.
(
3
)
Computation of dollar value of stock traded.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, the value in U.S. dollars of shares traded during a calendar year shall be determined on the basis of the dollar value of such shares traded as reported by the World Federation of Exchanges located in Paris (or a successor institution), or, if not so reported, by converting into U.S. dollars the aggregate value in local currency of the shares traded using an exchange rate equal to the average of the spot rates on the last day of each month of the calendar year.
(ii)
Certain affiliated entities related to a publicly traded corporation.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) if it is a corporation that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group (as defined in § 1.1471-5(i)) as a corporation described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (without regard to whether such corporation is a NFFE).
(iii)
Certain territory entities.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii) if it is a territory entity that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by one or more bona fide residents of the U.S. territory under the laws of which the entity is organized. The term
bona fide resident of a U.S. territory
means an individual who qualifies as a bona fide resident under section 937(a) and § 1.937-1.
(iv)
Active NFFEs.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) (and thus constitutes an active NFFE) if it is an entity and for the preceding calendar or fiscal year less than 50 percent of its gross income is passive income and the weighted average of the percentage of assets held by it that produce or are held for the production of passive income (weighted by total assets and measured quarterly) is less than 50 percent, as determined after the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section (passive assets). For purposes of the calculations described in the preceding sentence, a NFFE may use any accounting method permitted under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section but must apply a uniform method for measuring assets for the calendar or fiscal year.
(A)
Passive income.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the term
passive income
means the portion of gross income that consists of—
(
1
) Dividends, including substitute dividend amounts;
(
2
) Interest;
(
3
) Income equivalent to interest, including substitute interest and amounts received from or with respect to a pool of insurance contracts if the amounts received depend in whole or part upon the performance of the pool;

8
) The excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses (as
defined in section 988(b)) attributable to any section 988 transaction;

Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the term
passive income
does not include—
(
1
) Any income from interest, dividends, rents, or royalties that is received or accrued from a related person to the extent such amount is properly allocable to income of such related person that is not passive income. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B)(
1
), the term “related person” has the meaning given such term by section 954(d)(3) determined by substituting “foreign entity” for “controlled foreign corporation” each place it appears in section 954(d)(3); or
(
2
) In the case of a foreign entity that regularly acts as a dealer in property described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A)(
6

(
i
) Any item of income or gain (other than any dividends or interest) from any transaction (including hedging transactions and transactions involving physical settlement) entered into in the ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business as such a dealer; and
(
ii
) If such dealer is a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 475(c)(2)), any income from any transaction entered into in the ordinary course of such trade or business as a dealer in securities.
(C)
Methods of measuring assets.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(iv), the value of a NFFE's assets is determined based on the fair market value or book value of the assets that is reflected on the NFFE's balance sheet (as determined under either a U.S. or an international financial accounting standard).
(v)
Excepted nonfinancial entities.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(v) if it is an entity described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5) (referring to holding companies, treasury centers, and captive finance companies that are members of a nonfinancial group; start-up companies; entities that are liquidating or emerging from bankruptcy; and non-profit organizations).
(vi)
Direct reporting NFFEs.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(vi) if it meets the requirements described in § 1.1472-1(c)(3) to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE.
(vii)
Sponsored direct reporting NFFEs.
A NFFE is described in this paragraph (c)(1)(vii) if it meets the requirements described in § 1.1472-1(c)(5) to be treated as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE.

(ii) The NFFE must report directly to the IRS on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) the following information for each calendar year (or, may be required by the IRS to certify on Form 8966, or in such other manner as the IRS may prescribe, that the NFFE has no substantial U.S. owners):
(A) The name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner (as defined in § 1.1473-1(b)) of such NFFE;
(B) The total of all payments made to each substantial U.S. owner (including the gross amounts paid or credited to the substantial U.S. owner with respect to such owner's equity interest in the
NFFE during the calendar year, which include payments in redemption or liquidation (in whole or part) of the substantial U.S. owner's equity interest in the NFFE);
(C) The value of each substantial U.S. owner's equity interest in the NFFE determined by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4) (substituting the term
equity
for the terms
account
and
financial account
);
(D) The name, address, and GIIN of the NFFE; and
(E) Any other information as required by Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and its accompanying instructions;
(iii) The NFFE must obtain a written certification (contained on a withholding certificate or in a written statement) from each person that would be treated as a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE if such person were a specified U.S. person. Such written certification must indicate whether the person is a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE, and if so, the name, address and TIN of the person. If the NFFE has reason to know that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect, it must contact the person and request a revised written certification. If no revised written certification is received, the NFFE must treat the person as a substantial U.S. owner and report on Form 8966 the information required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The NFFE has reason to know that such a written certification is unreliable or incorrect if the certification is inconsistent with information in the NFFE's possession, including information that the NFFE provides to a financial institution in order for the financial institution to meet its AML or other account identification due diligence procedures with respect to the NFFE's account, information that is publicly available, or U.S. indicia as described in § 1.1441-7(b) for which appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia in the manner set forth in § 1.1441-7(b)(8) has not been obtained;
(iv) The NFFE must keep records that it produces in the ordinary course of its business that summarize the activity (including the gross amounts described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section that are paid or credited to each of its substantial U.S. owners) relating to its transactions with respect to the equity of the NFFE held by each of its substantial U.S. owners for any calendar year in which the owner was required to be reported under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The records must be retained for the longer of six years or the retention period under the NFFE's normal business procedures. A NFFE may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such an extension prior to the expiration of the six year period;
(v) The NFFE must respond to requests made by the IRS for additional information with respect to any substantial U.S. owner that is subject to reporting by the NFFE or with respect to the records described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section;
(vi) The NFFE must make a periodic certification to the IRS on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of each certification period relating to its compliance with respect to the election described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. The first certification period begins on the later of the date a GIIN is issued or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following that date. Each subsequent certification period is the three calendar year period following the close of the previous certification period. The certification will require an officer of the NFFE to certify to the following statements—
(A)(1) The NFFE has not had any events of default described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section; or
(2) If there are any events of default, appropriate measures were taken to remediate such failures and to prevent such failures from recurring; and
(B) With respect to any failure to report to the extent required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii), the NFFE has corrected such failure by filing the appropriate information returns; and
(vii) The NFFE has not had its status as a direct reporting NFFE revoked by the IRS.
(4)
Election to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE
—(i)
Manner of making
election.
A NFFE may elect to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE by registering on Form 8957 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) with the IRS to obtain a GIIN pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the IRS.
(ii)
Effective date of election.
The election is effective upon the issuance of a GIIN to the NFFE.
(iii)
Revocation of election by NFFE.
The election may be revoked by the NFFE by canceling its registration account on the FATCA registration Web site and notifying the IRS of its revocation in such manner as the IRS may prescribe in the Instructions for Form 8966, “FATCA Report.” The NFFE must also notify within 30 days its sponsoring entity (if applicable) and each withholding agent and financial institution from which it receives payments or with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in § 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) was provided on which the NFFE certified its status as a direct reporting NFFE if it revokes its election.
(iv)
Revocation of election by Commissioner.
The election may be revoked by the Commissioner upon an event of default described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section and following the notice and remediation procedures described in paragraphs (vi) and (vii) of this section. If the Commissioner revokes the NFFE's status as a direct reporting NFFE, the NFFE must provide notification within 30 days of the revocation to each withholding agent and financial institution from which the NFFE receives payments or with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement (as permitted for chapter 4 purposes) was provided by the NFFE to represent its status as a direct reporting NFFE.
(v)
Event of default.
An event of default occurs if a direct reporting NFFE fails to perform any of the obligations described in (c)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section. An event of default also includes any misrepresentation of a material fact to the IRS.
(vi)
Notice of event of default.
Following an event of default known by or disclosed to the IRS, the IRS will deliver to the NFFE a notice of default specifying the event of default. The IRS will request that the NFFE remediate the event of default within a specified time period. The NFFE must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the NFFE does not agree that an event of default has occurred. If the NFFE does not provide a response within the specified time period, the IRS may, at its sole discretion, deliver a notice to the NFFE that its election to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE has been revoked. A NFFE may request, within 90 days of receipt, reconsideration of a notice of default or notice of revocation by written request to the IRS.
(vii)
Remediation of event of default.
A NFFE will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the NFFE.
(5)
Election by a direct reporting NFFE to be treated as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE
—(i)
Definition of sponsored direct reporting NFFE.
A NFFE is a sponsored direct reporting NFFE if the NFFE is a direct reporting NFFE and if another entity, other than a nonparticipating FFI, has agreed with the NFFE to act as its sponsoring entity, as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Requirements for sponsoring entity of a sponsored direct reporting NFFE.
A sponsoring entity meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) if the sponsoring entity—
(A) Is authorized to act on behalf of the NFFE;
(B) Has registered with the IRS as a sponsoring entity;
(C) Has registered the NFFE with the IRS as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE by the later of January 1, 2017, or the date that the NFFE identifies itself to a withholding agent or financial institution as qualifying as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE under paragraph (c)(5) of this section;
(D) Agrees to perform, on behalf of the NFFE, all due diligence, reporting, and other requirements that the NFFE would have been required to perform as a direct reporting NFFE;
(E) Identifies the NFFE in all reporting completed on the NFFE's behalf;
(F) Complies with the certification and other requirements in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section;
(G) Has not had its status as a sponsoring entity revoked; and
(H) Agrees to notify all relevant withholding agents and the IRS if its status as a sponsoring entity is revoked, if it otherwise ceases to be the sponsoring entity of any of its sponsored direct reporting NFFEs (for example, if the sponsored direct reporting NFFE changes sponsors), or if the status of any of its sponsored direct reporting NFFEs has been revoked.
(iii)
Revocation of status as sponsoring entity.
The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status as a sponsoring entity with respect to all sponsored direct reporting NFFEs if there is an event of default as defined in paragraph (g) of this section with respect to any sponsored direct reporting NFFE.
(iv)
Liability of sponsoring entity.
A sponsoring entity is not liable for any failure to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. A sponsored direct reporting NFFE will remain liable for all of its chapter 4 obligations without regard to any failure of its sponsoring entity to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section that the sponsoring entity has agreed to undertake on behalf of the NFFE.
(d)
Rules for determining payee and beneficial owner
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, except in the case of a payee that is a QI, WP, or WT, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by the payee as determined under § 1.1471-3. Thus, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by an excepted NFFE (other than a QI, WP, or WT) if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation to determine the payee's status as an excepted NFFE under the rules of § 1.1471-3(d).
(2)
Payments made to a NFFE that is a QI, WP, or WT.
A withholding agent may treat the payee of a withholdable payment as a NFFE that is a QI, WP, or WT if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation to determine the payee's status as such under the rules of § 1.1471-3(b)(3) and (d).
(3)
Payments made to a partner or beneficiary of an NFFE that is an NWP or NWT.
A withholding agent may treat a partner or beneficiary of an NFFE that is an NWP or NWT, respectively, as the payee of a withholdable payment under this section if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid Form W-8 or written notification that the NFFE is a flow-through entity as described in § 1.1471-3(c)(2), including valid documentation sufficient to establish the chapter 4 status of each payee of the payment that is a partner or beneficiary, respectively, by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-3(d).
(4)
Payments made to a beneficial owner that is an NFFE.
A withholding agent may treat the beneficial owner of a withholdable payment as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners or that has identified all of its substantial U.S. owners if it can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation identifying the beneficial owner as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners or that has identified all of its substantial U.S. owners by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-3(d).
(5)
Absence of valid documentation.
A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate the payment with documentation as described in any of paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section must treat the payment as made to a payee in accordance with the presumption rules under § 1.1471-3(f).
(e)
Information reporting requirements
—(1)
Reporting on withholdable payments.
A withholding agent that treats a withholdable payment as made to any payee described in paragraph (d) of this section must provide information about such payee on Form 1042-S and file a withholding income tax return on Form 1042 to the extent required under § 1.1474-1(d) and (c), respectively.
(2)
Reporting on substantial U.S. owners.
A withholding agent that receives information about any substantial U.S. owners of an NFFE that is not an excepted NFFE must report information about the NFFE's substantial U.S.
owners in accordance with § 1.1474-1(i)(2). See § 1.1471-4(d) for the reporting requirements of a participating FFI with respect to the substantial U.S. owners of account holders that are NFFEs.
(f)
Sponsoring entity verification
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) describes the requirements for a sponsoring entity to provide a certification of compliance with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section and defines the certification period for such certifications. This paragraph (f) also describes the procedures for the IRS to review the sponsoring entity's compliance with such requirements during the certification period. Finally, this paragraph (f) describes the requirement that a sponsoring entity have in place a written sponsorship agreement with each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for which it acts and specifies the terms of such agreement. See paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, describing an event of default for a sponsoring entity that does not have a sponsorship agreement with each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for which it acts as a sponsoring entity. References in this paragraph (f) or paragraph (g) of this section to a sponsored direct reporting NFFE mean a sponsored direct reporting NFFE for which the sponsoring entity acts as a sponsoring entity under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Certification of compliance
—(i)
Certification requirement
—(A)
In general.
The sponsoring entity must appoint a responsible officer to oversee the sponsoring entity's compliance with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the certification period, the responsible officer of the sponsoring entity must make a certification for the certification period with respect to all sponsored direct reporting NFFEs for which the sponsoring entity acts during the certification period on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. To the extent that a sponsoring entity satisfies the certification requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section on behalf of a sponsored direct reporting NFFE, the NFFE does not have a certification requirement under paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section.
(B)
Extension of time for the certification period ending on December 31, 2017.
The certifications required for a certification period ending on December 31, 2017, must be submitted on or before March 31, 2019.
(ii)
Late-joining sponsored direct reporting NFFEs.
In general, with respect to a certification period, a sponsoring entity is not required to make a certification for a sponsored direct reporting NFFE that first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity during the six-month period before the end of the sponsoring entity's certification period, provided that the sponsoring entity makes certifications for such sponsored direct reporting NFFE for subsequent certification periods, and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the sponsoring entity during which the sponsored direct reporting NFFE was sponsored by the sponsoring entity. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to a sponsored direct reporting NFFE that, immediately before the NFFE agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity, was a direct reporting NFFE or sponsored direct reporting NFFE of another sponsoring entity. The sponsoring entity may certify for a sponsored direct reporting NFFE described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the sponsoring entity before the date that the NFFE first agrees to be sponsored by the sponsoring entity if the sponsoring entity obtains from the NFFE (or the NFFE's sponsoring entity, if applicable) a written certification that the NFFE has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The sponsoring entity does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the sponsored direct reporting NFFE for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the
prior certification period during which such NFFE was sponsored by the sponsoring entity.
(iii)
Certification period.
The first certification period of a sponsoring entity begins on the later of the date the sponsoring entity is issued a GIIN to act as a sponsoring entity or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year after such date. Each subsequent certification period is the three-calendar-year period following the close of the previous certification period.
(iv)
Certifications.
The certification will require the responsible officer of the sponsoring entity to certify to the following statements—
(A) The sponsoring entity meets all of the requirements of a sponsoring entity described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section;
(B) The sponsoring entity has the written sponsorship agreement described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section in effect with each sponsored direct reporting NFFE;
(C) There were no events of default (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) with respect to the sponsoring entity, or, to the extent there were any such events of default, appropriate measures were taken by the sponsoring entity to remediate and prevent such events from reoccurring; and
(D) With respect to any failure to report to the extent required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to one or more sponsored direct reporting NFFEs, the sponsoring entity has corrected such failure by filing the appropriate information returns.
(3)
IRS review of compliance
—(i)
General inquiries.
The IRS, based upon the information reporting forms described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section filed with the IRS (or the absence of such reporting) by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsored direct reporting NFFE, may request additional information with respect to the information reported (or required to be reported) on the forms about any substantial U.S. owner reported on the form or the records for each direct reporting NFFE described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. The IRS may also request any additional information from the sponsoring entity (including a copy of each sponsorship agreement the sponsoring entity has entered into with each sponsored FFI) to determine its compliance with paragraph (f) of this section with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE and to assist the IRS with its review of any substantial U.S. owners' compliance with tax reporting requirements.
(ii)
Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.
The IRS may determine in its discretion that a sponsoring entity may not have substantially complied with the requirements of a sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. This determination is based on the information reporting forms referenced in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section filed with the IRS by the sponsoring entity for each calendar year with respect to any sponsored direct reporting NFFE (or the absence of such reporting), the certification made by the responsible officer described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (or the absence of such certification), or any other information related to the sponsoring entity's compliance with the requirements of a sponsoring entity with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. In such a case, the IRS may request from the responsible officer information necessary to verify the sponsoring entity's compliance with such requirements. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the circumstances surrounding the sponsoring entity's potential failure to comply with the requirements of a sponsoring entity.
(4)
Sponsorship agreement.
The sponsoring entity must have a written sponsorship agreement (which may be part of another agreement between the sponsoring entity and the sponsored direct reporting NFFE) in place with each sponsored direct reporting NFFE for which it acts by the later of March 31, 2019, or the date that the sponsoring
entity begins acting as a sponsoring entity for the applicable sponsored direct reporting NFFE, under which—
(i) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE agrees to provide the sponsoring entity access to the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's books and records regarding each of its owners (including AML/KYC documentation regarding the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's owners provided by the sponsored direct reporting NFFE with respect to each financial account it holds) and such other information sufficient for the sponsoring entity to determine the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE, including the information about such owners required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to be reported on Form 8966, “FATCA Report” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe);
(ii) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE obtains a valid and effective waiver of any legal prohibitions on reporting the information about its direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to be reported on Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe);
(iii) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE authorizes the sponsoring entity to act on the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's behalf with respect to the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's obligations as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE (for example, authorizing the sponsoring entity to file Form 8966 on the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's behalf, responding to the IRS inquiries described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, and providing the certification described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section);
(iv) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE agrees to identify to the sponsoring entity on request each withholding agent and financial institution to which the sponsored direct reporting NFFE reports its status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE and agrees to provide to the sponsoring entity a copy of the withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in § 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) that the sponsored direct reporting NFFE provides to each such withholding agent or financial institution;
(v) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE represents that it does not have any formal or informal practices or procedures to assist its substantial U.S. owners with the avoidance of the requirements of chapter 4;
(vi) The sponsored direct reporting NFFE agrees to cooperate with the sponsoring entity in responding to any IRS inquiries under paragraph (f)(3) of this section with respect to the sponsored direct reporting NFFE; and
(vii) The sponsoring entity retains the records described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section for the longer of six years or the retention period under the sponsoring entity's normal business procedures. A sponsoring entity may be required to extend the retention period if the IRS requests such an extension before the expiration of the period.
(g)
Sponsoring entity event of default
—(1)
Defined.
An event of default by the sponsoring entity means the occurrence of any of the following—
(i) Failure to have the written sponsorship agreement described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section in effect with each sponsored direct reporting NFFE;
(ii) Failure to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE that the NFFE would have been required to satisfy as a direct reporting NFFE;
(iii) Failure to report to the IRS on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) all of the information required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to each sponsored direct reporting NFFE and each of its substantial U.S. owners (or report to the IRS on Form 8966 that the sponsored direct reporting NFFE had no substantial U.S. owners) by the due date of the form (including any extensions);
(iv) Failure to make the certification required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
(v) Failure to cooperate with an IRS request for additional information described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, including requests for the records described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this
section and requests to extend the retention period for these records as described in (f)(4)(vii) of this section;
(vi) Making any fraudulent statement or misrepresentation of material fact to the IRS or representing to a withholding agent or the IRS its status as a sponsoring entity under paragraph (c)(5) of this section for an entity other than an entity for which it acts as a sponsoring entity; or
(vii) Failure to obtain from each sponsored direct reporting NFFE the information required to report on Form 8966.
(2)
Notice of event of default.
Following an event of default known by or disclosed to the IRS, the IRS will deliver to the sponsoring entity a notice of default specifying the event of default and, if applicable, identifying each sponsored direct reporting NFFE to which the notice relates. The IRS will request that the sponsoring entity remediate the event of default within 45 days (unless additional time is requested and agreed to by the IRS). The sponsoring entity must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the sponsoring entity does not agree that an event of default has occurred.
(3)
Remediation of event of default.
A sponsoring entity will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent that it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the sponsoring entity, remedial actions, or the performance of the specified review procedures described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Termination
—(i)
In general.
If the sponsoring entity does not provide a response to a notice of default within the period specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, or if the sponsoring entity does not satisfy the conditions of the remediation plan within the time period specified by the IRS, the IRS may deliver a notice of termination that terminates the sponsoring entity's status, the status of one or more sponsored direct reporting NFFEs as a direct reporting NFFE, or the status of both the sponsoring entity and one or more sponsored direct reporting NFFEs.
(ii)
Termination of sponsoring entity.
If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that its status is terminated, the sponsoring entity must send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which each sponsored direct reporting NFFE receives payments and each financial institution with which each sponsored direct reporting NFFE holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in § 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) was provided. A sponsoring entity that has had its status terminated cannot reregister on the FATCA registration website to act as a sponsoring entity for any sponsored direct reporting NFFE unless it receives written approval from the IRS. Unless the status of the sponsored direct reporting NFFEs has been terminated, the sponsored direct reporting NFFEs may register on the FATCA registration website as direct reporting NFFEs or as sponsored direct reporting NFFEs of another sponsoring entity, other than a sponsoring entity that is related to the sponsoring entity that was terminated (absent written approval from the IRS allowing the registration). An entity is related to the terminated sponsoring entity if they have a relationship with each other that is described in section 267(b) or 707(b).
(iii)
Termination of sponsored direct reporting NFFE.
If the IRS notifies the sponsoring entity that the status of a sponsored direct reporting NFFE is terminated (but not the sponsoring entity's status), the sponsoring entity must remove the sponsored direct reporting NFFE from the sponsoring entity's registration account on the FATCA registration website and send notice of the termination within 30 days after the date of termination to each withholding agent from which the sponsored direct reporting NFFE receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or written statement prescribed in § 1.1471-3(d)(11)(x)(B) (as applicable) was
provided with respect to such sponsored direct reporting NFFE. A sponsored direct reporting NFFE that has had its status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE terminated (independent from a termination of status of its sponsoring entity) may not register on the FATCA registration website as a direct reporting NFFE or as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE of another sponsoring entity unless it receives written approval from the IRS.
(iv)
Reconsideration of notice of default or notice of termination.
A sponsoring entity or sponsored direct reporting NFFE may request, within 90 days of a notice of default or notice of termination, reconsideration of the notice of default or notice of termination by written request to the IRS.
(h)
Applicability date.
This section generally applies beginning on January 6, 2017, except for paragraphs (c)(5)(iii), (f), and (g) of this section, which apply March 25, 2019. However, taxpayers may apply these provisions as of January 28, 2013. (For the rules that otherwise apply beginning on January 6, 2017, and before March 25, 2019, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2018. For rules that otherwise apply beginning on January 28, 2013, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2016.)

§ 1.1473-1
Section 1473 definitions.
(a)
Definition of withholdable payment
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a) and § 1.1471-2(b) (regarding grandfathered obligations), the term
withholdable payment
means—
(i) Any payment of U.S. source FDAP income (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section); and
(ii) For any sales or other dispositions occurring after December 31, 2018, any gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section) of any property of a type that can produce interest or dividends that are U.S. source FDAP income.
(2)
U.S. source FDAP income defined
—(i)
In general
—(A)
FDAP income defined.
For purposes of chapter 4, the term
FDAP income
means fixed or determinable annual or periodic income that is described in § 1.1441-2(b)(1) or § 1.1441-2(c) (excluding income described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section or § 1.1441-2(b)(2) (such as gains derived from the sale of certain property)) and including the types of income enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) through (v) of this section.
(B)
U.S. source.
The term
U.S. source
means derived from sources within the United States. A payment is derived from sources within the United States if it is income treated as derived from sources within the United States under sections 861 through 865 and other relevant provisions of the Code. In the case of a payment of FDAP income for which the source cannot be determined at the time of payment, see § 1.1471-2(a)(5).
(C)
Exceptions to withholding on U.S. source FDAP income not applicable under chapter 4.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, no exception to withholding on U.S. source FDAP income for purposes other than chapter 4 applies for purposes of determining whether a payment of such income is a withholdable payment under chapter 4. Thus, for example, an exclusion from an amount subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a) or an exclusion from taxation under section 881 does not apply for purposes of determining whether such income constitutes a withholdable payment.
(ii)
Special rule for certain interest.
Interest that is described in section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest paid by foreign branches of domestic corporations and partnerships) is treated as U.S. source FDAP income.
(iii)
Original issue discount.
The rules described in § 1.1441-2(b)(3)(ii) for determining when an amount representing original issue discount is subject to withholding for chapter 3 purposes apply for purposes of determining when original issue discount from sources within the United States is U.S. source FDAP income.
(iv)
REMIC residual interests.
U.S. source FDAP income includes an amount described in § 1.1441-2(b)(5).
(v)
Withholding liability of payee that is satisfied by withholding agent.
If a withholding agent satisfies a withholding liability arising under chapter 4 with respect to a withholdable payment from the withholding agent's own funds, the satisfaction of such liability is treated as an additional payment of U.S. source FDAP income to the payee to the extent that the withholding agent's satisfaction of such withholding liability also satisfies a tax liability of the payee under section 881 or 871 with respect to the same payment, and the satisfaction of the tax liability constitutes additional income to the payee under § 1.1441-3(f) that is U.S. source FDAP income. In such case, the amount of any additional payment treated as made by the withholding agent for purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(v) and any tax liability resulting from such payment shall be determined under § 1.1441-3(f). See § 1.1474-6 regarding the coordination of the withholding requirements under chapters 3 and 4 in the case of a withholdable payment that is also subject to withholding under chapter 3.
(vi)
Special rule for sales of interest bearing debt obligations.
Income that is otherwise described as U.S. source FDAP income in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section does not include an amount of interest accrued on the date of a sale or exchange of an interest bearing debt obligation if the sale occurs between two interest payment dates and is not part of a plan described in § 1.1441-3(b)(2)(ii).
(vii)
Payment of U.S. source FDAP income
—(A)
Amount of payment of U.S. source FDAP income.
The amount of U.S. source FDAP income is the gross amount of the payment of such income, unreduced by any deductions or offsets. The rules of § 1.1441-3(b)(1) shall apply to determine the amount of an interest payment on an interest-bearing obligation. In the case of a corporate distribution, the distributing corporation or intermediary shall determine the portion of the distribution that is treated as U.S. source FDAP income under this paragraph (a)(2) in the same manner as the distributing corporation or intermediary determines the portion of the distribution subject to withholding under § 1.1441-3(c). Any portion of a payment on a debt instrument or a corporate distribution that does not constitute U.S. source FDAP income under this paragraph (a)(2) solely because of a provision other than the source rules of sections 861 through 865 shall be taken into account as gross proceeds under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. For rules regarding the determination of the amount of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income under paragraph (a)(2) of this section made in a medium other than U.S. dollars, see § 1.1441-3(e). For determining the amount of a payment of a dividend equivalent, see section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder.
(B)
When payment of U.S. source FDAP income is made.
A payment is considered made when the amount would be includible in the income of the beneficial owner under the U.S. tax principles governing the cash method of accounting. If an FFI acts as an intermediary with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the FFI will be treated as making a payment of such U.S. source FDAP income to the person with respect to which the FFI acts as an intermediary when it pays or credits such amount to such person. The following rules also apply for purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(vii)(B): §§ 1.1441-2(e)(2) (regarding when a payment is considered made in the case of income allocated under section 482); 1.1441-2(e)(3) (regarding blocked income); 1.1441-2(e)(4) (regarding when a dividend is considered paid); and 1.1441-2(e)(5) (regarding when interest is considered paid if a foreign person has made an election under § 1.884-4(c)(1)).
(3)
Gross proceeds defined
—(i)
Sale or other disposition
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3)(i), the term
sale or other disposition
means any sale, exchange, or disposition of property described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section that requires recognition of gain or loss under section 1001(c), determined without regard to whether the owner of such property is subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such sale, exchange, or disposition. The term sale or other disposition includes (but is not
limited to) sales of securities; redemptions of stock; retirements and redemptions of indebtedness; entering into short sales; and a closing transaction under a forward contract, option, or other instrument that is otherwise a sale. Such term further includes a distribution from a corporation to the extent the distribution is a return of capital or a capital gain to the beneficial owner of the payment. Such term does not include grants or purchases of options, exercises of call options for physical delivery, transfers of securities for which gain or loss is excluded from recognition under section 1058, or mere executions of contracts that require delivery of personal property or an interest therein. For purposes of this section only, a constructive sale under section 1259 or a mark to fair market value under section 475 or 1296 is not a sale or disposition.
(B)
Special rule for sales effected by brokers.
In the case of a sale effected by a broker (with the term
effect
defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(10)), a sale means a sale as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(9) with respect to property described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Special rule for gross proceeds from sales settled by a clearing organization.
In the case of a clearing organization that settles sales and purchases of securities between members of such organization on a net basis, the gross proceeds from sales or dispositions are limited to the net amount paid or credited to a member's account that is associated with sales or other dispositions of property described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section by such member as of the time that such transactions are settled under the settlement procedures of such organization.
(ii)
Property of a type that can produce interest or dividend payments that would be U.S. source FDAP income
—(A)
In general.
Property is of a type that can produce interest or dividends payments that would be U.S. source FDAP income if the property is of a type that ordinarily gives rise to the payment of interest or dividends that would constitute U.S. source FDAP income, regardless of whether any such payment is made during the period such property is held by the person selling or disposing of such property. Thus, for example, stock issued by a domestic corporation is property of a type that can produce dividends from sources within the United States if a dividend from such corporation would be from sources within the United States, regardless of whether the stock pays dividends at regular intervals and regardless of whether the issuer has any plans to pay dividends or has ever paid a dividend with respect to the stock.
(B)
Contracts producing dividend equivalent payments.
In the case of any contract that results in the payment of a dividend equivalent as defined in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder (including as part of a termination payment), such contract shall be treated as property that is described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, without regard to whether the taxpayer is a foreign person subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such transaction. To the extent that the proceeds from a termination payment include the payment of a dividend equivalent, the gross amount of such proceeds will not include the amount of such dividend equivalent.
(C)
Regulated investment company distributions.
The amount of a distribution that is designated as a capital gain dividend under section 852(b)(3)(C) or 871(k)(2) is a payment of gross proceeds to the extent attributable to property described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii)
Payment of gross proceeds
—(A)
When gross proceeds are paid.
With respect to a sale that is effected by a broker that results in a payment of gross proceeds as defined in this paragraph (a)(3), the date the gross proceeds are considered paid is the date that the proceeds of such sale are credited to the account of or otherwise made available to the person entitled to the payment.
(B)
Amount of gross proceeds.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3)—
(
1
) The amount of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition means the total amount realized as a result of a sale or other disposition of property described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) under section 1001(b);
(
2
) In the case of a sale effected by a broker, the amount of gross proceeds
from a sale or other disposition means the total amount paid or credited to the account of the person entitled to the payment increased by any amount not so paid by reason of the repayment of margin loans. The broker may (but is not required to) take commissions with respect to the sale into account in determining the amount of gross proceeds;
(
3
) In the case of a corporate distribution, the amount treated as gross proceeds excludes the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(vii)(A) of this section that is treated as U.S. source FDAP income;
(
4
) In the case of a sale of an obligation described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi), gross proceeds includes any interest accrued between interest payment dates other than an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is treated as U.S. source FDAP income; and
(
5
) In the case of a sale, retirement, or redemption of a debt obligation, gross proceeds excludes the amount of original issue discount treated as U.S. source FDAP income under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(4)
Payments not treated as withholdable payments.
The following payments are not withholdable payments under paragraph (a)(1) of this section—
(i)
Certain short-term obligations.
A payment of interest or original issue discount on short-term obligations described in section 871(g)(1)(B)(i).
(ii)
Effectively connected income.
Any payment to the extent it gives rise to an item of income that is taken into account under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) for the taxable year. An item of income is taken into account under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) when the income is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and is includible in the beneficial owner's gross income for the taxable year. An amount of income shall not be treated as taken into account under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) if the income is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and the beneficial owner claims an exception from tax under an income tax treaty because the income is not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States.
(iii)
Excluded nonfinancial payments.
Payments for the following: services (including wages and other forms of employee compensation (such as stock options)), the use of property, office and equipment leases, software licenses, transportation, freight, gambling winnings, awards, prizes, scholarships, and interest on outstanding accounts payable arising from the acquisition of goods or services. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, excluded nonfinancial payments do not include: payments in connection with a lending transaction (including loans of securities), a forward, futures, option, or notional principal contract, or a similar financial instrument; premiums for insurance contracts or annuity contracts; amounts paid under cash value insurance or annuity contracts; dividends; interest (including substitute interest described in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) other than interest described in the preceding sentence; gross proceeds other than gross proceeds described in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section; investment advisory fees; custodial fees; and bank or brokerage fees.
(iv)
Gross proceeds from sales of excluded property.
Gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any property that can produce U.S. source FDAP income if all such U.S. source FDAP income would be excluded from the definition of withholdable payment under paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(v)
Fractional shares.
Payments arising in sales described in § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(ix).
(vi)
Offshore payments of U.S. source FDAP income prior to 2017 (transitional).
A payment with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(88)) made prior to January 1, 2017, if such payment is U.S. source FDAP income and made by a person that is not acting as an intermediary or as a WP or WT with respect to the payment. Additionally, a payment with respect to an account, obligation, contract, or other instrument that is issued or maintained by an entity other than a financial institution and that would be treated as an offshore
obligation under § 1.6049-5(c)(1) (applied by substituting the term
entity
for the term
financial institution
(as defined in § 1.1471-5(e)) in each place that it appears), made prior to January 1, 2017, if such payment is U.S. source FDAP and made by a person that is not acting as an intermediary or as a WP or WT with respect to the payment is not a withholdable payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The exception for offshore payments of U.S. source FDAP income provided in the preceding sentences shall not apply, however, in the case of a flow-through entity that has a residual withholding requirement with respect to its partners, owners, or beneficiaries under § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii), or in the case of payments made with respect to debt or equity issued by a U.S. person (excluding interest payments made by a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution with respect to depository accounts it maintains). For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(vi), an intermediary includes a person that acts as a qualified securities lender as defined for purposes of chapter 3 and does not include a person acting as an insurance broker with respect to premiums.
(vii)
Collateral arrangements prior to 2017 (transitional).
A payment made prior to January 1, 2017, by a secured party, or to a secured party other than a nonparticipating FFI, with respect to collateral securing one or more transactions under a collateral arrangement, provided that only a commercially reasonable amount of collateral is held by the secured party (or by a third party for the benefit of the secured party) as part of the collateral arrangement. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(vii), the term
transaction
generally includes a debt instrument, a derivative financial instrument (including a notional principal contract, future, forward, and option), and any securities lending transaction, sale-repurchase transaction, margin loan, or substantially similar transaction that is subject to a collateral arrangement. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(vii), a secured party may provide documentation to the withholding agent indicating that it is the beneficial owner of a payment described in this paragraph (a)(4)(vii), and a withholding agent may rely on such certification for purposes of its requirements under § 1.1471-3(d) for determining whether withholding under chapter 4 applies.
(viii)
Certain dividend equivalents.
Amounts paid with respect to a notional principal contract described in § 1.871-15(a)(7), an equity-linked instrument described in § 1.871-15(a)(4), or a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction described in § 1.871-15(a)(13) that are exempt from withholding under section 1441(a) as dividend equivalents under section 871(m) if the transaction is not a section 871(m) transaction within the meaning of § 1.871-15(a)(12), if the transaction is subject to the exception described in § 1.871-15(k), or to the extent the payment is not a dividend equivalent pursuant to § 1.871-15(c)(2).
(5)
Special payment rules for flow-through entities, complex trusts, and estates
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (a)(5) provides special rules for a flow-through entity, complex trust, or estate to determine when such entity must treat a payment of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment as having been paid by such entity to its partners, owners, or beneficiaries (as applicable depending on the type of entity).
(ii)
Partnerships.
An amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment is treated as being paid to a partner under rules similar to the rules prescribing when withholding is required for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A).
(iii)
Simple trusts.
An amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment is treated as being paid to a beneficiary of a simple trust under rules similar to the rules prescribing when withholding is required for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1441-5(b)(2)(ii).
(iv)
Complex trusts and estates.
An amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment is treated as being paid to a beneficiary of a complex trust or estate under rules similar to the rules prescribing when withholding is required for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1441-5(b)(2)(iii).
(v)
Grantor trusts.
If an amount of U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment is paid to a grantor trust, a person treated as an owner of all or a portion of such trust is treated as having been paid such income by the trust at the time it is received by or credited to the trust or portion thereof.
(vi)
Special rule for an NWP or NWT.
In the case of a partnership, simple trust, or complex trust that is an NWP or NWT, the rules described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section shall not apply, and U.S. source FDAP income that is also a withholdable payment is treated as being paid to the partner or beneficiary at the time the income is paid to the partnership or trust, respectively.
(vii)
Special rules for determining when gross proceeds are treated as paid to a partner, owner, or beneficiary of a flow-through entity.
[Reserved]
(6)
Reporting of withholdable payments.
See § 1.1474-1(c) and (d) for a description of the income tax return and information reporting requirements applicable to a withholding agent that has made a withholdable payment.
(7)
Example. Satisfaction of payee's chapter 4 liability by withholding agent.
Recalcitrant account holder (RA) is entitled to receive a payment of $100 of U.S. source interest from withholding agent, WA. The payment is subject to withholding under chapter 4, but is not subject to withholding under section 1442, and RA has no substantive tax liability under section 881 with respect to this payment. WA pays the full $100 to RA and, after the date of payment, pays the $30 of tax due under chapter 4 to the IRS from its own funds. Because no underlying tax liability of RA is satisfied, and further because WA and RA did not execute any agreement for WA to pay this tax and WA did not have an obligation to pay this tax apart from the requirements of chapter 4, WA's payment of the tax does not give rise to a deemed payment of U.S. source FDAP income to RA under paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. Thus, WA is not required to pay any additional tax with respect to this payment for purposes of chapter 4.
(b)
Substantial U.S. owner
—(1)
Definition.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section, the term
substantial United States owner
(or
substantial U.S. owner
) means:
(i) With respect to any foreign corporation, any specified U.S. person that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the stock of such corporation (by vote or value);
(ii) With respect to any foreign partnership, any specified U.S. person that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the profits interests or capital interests in such partnership; and
(iii) In the case of a trust—
(A) Any specified U.S. person treated as an owner of any portion of the trust under sections 671 through 679; and
(B) Any specified U.S. person that holds, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the beneficial interests of the trust.
(2)
Indirect ownership of foreign entities.
For purposes of determining a person's interest in a foreign entity, the following rules shall apply.
(i)
Indirect ownership of stock.
Stock of a foreign corporation that is owned directly or indirectly by an entity (other than a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI (excluding an owner-documented FFI), a U.S. financial institution, a U.S. person that is not a specified U.S. person, an exempt beneficial owner, or an excepted NFFE) that is a corporation, partnership, or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by such entity's shareholders, partners, or, in the case of a trust, persons treated as owners under sections 671 through 679 of any portion of the trust that includes the stock, and the beneficiaries of the trust. Stock considered to be owned by a person by reason of the application of the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of applying such sentence, be treated as actually owned by such person.
(ii)
Indirect ownership in a foreign partnership or ownership of a beneficial interest in a foreign trust.
A capital or profits interest in a foreign partnership or an ownership or beneficial interest (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) in a foreign trust that is owned or held directly or indirectly by an entity (other than a participating
FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI (excluding an owner-documented FFI), a U.S. financial institution, a U.S. person that is not a specified U.S. person, an exempt beneficial owner, or an excepted NFFE) that is a corporation, partnership, or trust shall be considered as being owned or held proportionately by such entity's shareholders, partners, or, in the case of a trust, persons treated as owners under sections 671 through 679 of any portion of the trust that includes the partnership or beneficial trust interest, and the beneficiaries of the trust. Partnership or beneficial trust interests considered to be owned or held by a person by reason of the application of the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of applying such sentence, be treated as actually owned or held by such person.
(iii)
Ownership and holdings through options.
If a specified U.S. person holds, directly or indirectly (applying the principles of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section) an option to acquire stock in a foreign corporation, a capital or profits interest in a foreign partnership, or an ownership or beneficial interest in a foreign trust, such person is considered to own the underlying equity or other ownership interest in such foreign entity for purposes of this paragraph (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered an option to acquire such stock or other ownership interest described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii).
(iv)
Determination of proportionate interest.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the determination of a person's proportionate interest in a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. In making this determination, any arrangement that artificially decreases a specified U.S. person's proportionate interest in any such entity will be disregarded in determining whether such person is a substantial U.S. owner. In lieu of applying the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) to determine whether an owner's proportionate interest in a foreign entity meets the 10 percent threshold described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the entity or its withholding agent may opt to treat the owner as a substantial U.S. owner.
(v)
Interests owned or held by a related person.
For purposes of determining whether a specified U.S. person is a substantial U.S. owner in a foreign entity described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, if a specified U.S. person owns or holds, directly or indirectly, any interest in the foreign entity, that interest must be aggregated with any such interest in the foreign entity owned or held, directly or indirectly, by a related person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a related person is a person or spouse of a person described in § 1.267(c)-1(a)(4), determined by reference to such specified U.S. person.
(3)
Beneficial interest in a foreign trust
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, a person holds a beneficial interest in a foreign trust if such person has the right to receive directly or indirectly (for example, through a nominee) a mandatory distribution or may receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary distribution from the trust. For purposes of this section, a
mandatory distribution
means a distribution that is required to be made pursuant to the terms of the trust document. A
discretionary distribution
means a distribution that is made to a person at the discretion of the trustee or a person with a limited power of appointment of such trust.
(ii)
Determining the 10 percent threshold in the case of a beneficial interest in a foreign trust.
A person will be treated as holding directly or indirectly more than 10 percent of the beneficial interest in a foreign trust if—
(A) The person receives, directly or indirectly, only discretionary distributions from the trust and the fair market value of the currency or other property distributed, directly or indirectly, from the trust to such person during the prior calendar year exceeds 10 percent of the value of either all of the distributions made by the trust during that year or all of the assets held by the trust at the end of that year;
(B) The person is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, mandatory distributions from the trust and the value of the person's interest in the trust, as determined under section 7520, exceeds 10 percent of the value of all the assets held by the trust as of the end of the prior calendar year; or
(C) The person is entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, mandatory distributions and may receive, directly or indirectly, discretionary distributions from the trust, and the value of the person's interest in the trust, determined as the sum of the fair market value of all of the currency or other property distributed from the trust at the discretion of the trustee during the prior calendar year to the person and the value of the person's interest in the trust as determined under section 7520 at the end of that year, exceeds either 10 percent of the value of all distributions made by such trust during the prior calendar year or 10 percent of the value of all the assets held by the trust at the end of that year.
(4)
Exceptions
—(i)
De minimis amount or value exception.
A specified U.S. person is not treated as a substantial U.S. owner if—
(A) The fair market value of the currency or other property distributed, directly or indirectly, from the trust to such specified U.S. person during the prior calendar year is $5,000 or less and,
(B) In the case of a specified U.S. person that is entitled to receive mandatory distributions, the value of such person's interest in the trust is $50,000 or less.
(ii)
Trusts wholly owned by certain U.S. persons.
A trust that is treated as owned only by U.S. persons under sections 671 through 679 is not required to treat any of its beneficiaries as substantial U.S. owners.
(5)
Special rule for certain financial institutions.
In the case of any financial institution described in § 1.1471-5(e)(1)(iii) or (iv) (referring to investment entities and specified insurance companies), this section shall be applied by substituting “0 percent” for “10 percent” in each place that it appears. Additionally, in the case of a financial institution described in § 1471-5(e)(1)(iii) that is a trust, the rules of paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section (referring to beneficial interests in a trust) shall be applied by substituting “calendar year” for “prior calendar year” in each place that it appears.
(6)
Determination dates for substantial U.S. owners.
A foreign entity may make the determination of whether it has one or more direct or indirect substantial U.S. owners as of the last day of such entity's accounting year or as of the date on which such foreign entity provides the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d) to the withholding agent for which such determination is required to be made. See § 1.1471-4(c) for when a participating FFI is required to obtain documentation with respect to its account holders.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section:

# Example 1. Indirect ownership.
U, a specified U.S. person, owns directly 100% of the sole class of stock of F1, a foreign corporation. F1 owns directly 90% of the sole class of stock of F2, a foreign corporation, and U owns directly the remaining 10% of the sole class of stock of F2. F2 owns directly 10% of the sole class of stock of F3, a foreign corporation, and U owns directly 3% of the sole class of stock of F3. U is treated as owning 13% (3% directly and 10% indirectly) of the sole class of stock of F3 and 100% (10% directly and 90% indirectly) of the sole class of stock of F2 for purposes of this paragraph (b). U is a substantial U.S. owner of F1, F2, and F3.

# Example 2. Indirect ownership through entities that are specified U.S. persons.
U, a specified U.S. person, owns directly 100% of the sole class of stock of US1, a U.S. corporation that is a specified U.S. person. US1 owns directly 100% of the sole class of stock of US2, a U.S. corporation that is a specified U.S. person. US2 owns directly 15% of the sole class of stock of FC, a foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b), U, US1, and US2 are all substantial U.S. owners of FC.

# Example 3. Determining the 10% threshold in the case of a beneficial interest in a foreign trust.
U, a U.S. citizen, holds an interest in FT1, a foreign trust, under which U may receive discretionary distributions from FT1. U also holds an interest in FT2, a foreign trust, and FT2, in turn, holds an interest in FT1 under which FT2 may receive discretionary distributions from FT1. U receives $25,000 from FT1 in Year 1. FT2 receives $120,000 from FT1 in Year 1 and distributes the entire amount to its beneficiaries in Year 1. The distribution from FT1 is FT2's only source of income and FT2's distributions in Year 1 total $120,000. U receives
$40,000 from FT2 in Year 1. FT1's distributions in Year 1 total $750,000. U's discretionary interest in FT1 is valued at $65,000 at the end of Year 1 and therefore does not meet the 10% threshold as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A). U's discretionary interest in FT2, however, is valued at $40,000 at the end of Year 1 and therefore meets the 10% threshold as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A).

# Example 4. Determining ownership (determination date).
F, a foreign corporation that is an NFFE, has a calendar year accounting year. On December 31 of Year 1, U, a specified U.S. person, owns 12% of the sole class of outstanding stock of F. In March of Year 2, F redeems a portion of U's stock and reduces U's ownership of F to 9%. In May of Year 2, F opens an account with P, a participating FFI, and delivers to P the documentation required under § 1.1471-3(d). At the time F opens its account with P, U is the only specified U.S. person that directly or indirectly owns stock in F. Because of the redemption, U's interest in F is 9% on the date F opens its account with P. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, F may determine whether it has a substantial U.S. owner as of the date it provides the documentation required under § 1.1471-3(d) to P, which would be the day it opens the account. As a result, F may indicate in its § 1.1471-3(d) documentation that it has no substantial U.S. owners.
(c)
Specified U.S. person.
The term
specified United States person
(or
specified U.S. person

(10) Any trust that is exempt from tax under section 664(c) or is described in section 4947(a)(1);
(11) A dealer in securities, commodities, or derivative financial instruments (including notional principal contracts, futures, forwards, and options) that is registered as such under the laws of the United States or any State;

Participating FFIs and registered deemed-compliant FFIs as withholding agents.
The term withholding agent includes a participating FFI that has the control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment of a passthru payment (as defined in § 1.1471-5(h)). The term withholding agent also includes a registered deemed-compliant FFI to the extent that such FFI is required to withhold on a passthru payment as part of the conditions for maintaining its status as a deemed-compliant FFI under § 1.1471-5(f)(1)(ii). For the withholding requirements of a participating FFI, including the requirement to withhold with respect to limited branches and limited FFIs that are in the same expanded affiliated group as the participating FFI, see §§ 1.1471-4(b) and 1.1472-1(a).
(3)
Grantor trusts as withholding agents.
The term withholding agent includes a grantor trust with respect to a withholdable payment or a foreign passthru payment (in the case of a grantor trust that is a participating FFI) made to a person treated as an owner of the trust under sections 671
through 679. For purposes of determining when a payment is treated as made to such a person, see § 1.1473-1(a)(5)(v).
(4)
Deposit and return requirements.
See § 1.1474-1(b) for a withholding agent's requirement to deposit any tax withheld, and § 1.1474-1(c) and (d) for the requirement to file income tax and information returns (including the special allowance in § 1.1474-1(b)(2) for participating FFIs with respect to dormant accounts).
(5)
Multiple withholding agents.
When several persons qualify as a withholding agent with respect to a single payment, only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited. See § 1.1474-1(a).

(6)
Exception for certain individuals.
An individual is not a withholding agent with respect to a withholdable payment made by the individual outside the course of such individual's trade or business (including as an agent with respect to making or receiving such payment).
(e)
Foreign entity.

§ 1.1474-1
Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting.
(a)
Payment and returns of tax withheld
—(1)
In general.
A withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld pursuant to chapter 4 as provided under paragraph (b) of this section and to make the returns prescribed by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. When several persons qualify as withholding agents with respect to a single payment, only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited.
(2)
Withholding agent liability.
A withholding agent that is required to withhold with respect to a payment under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b) (in the case of a participating FFI), or 1.1472-1(b) but fails either to withhold or to deposit any tax withheld as required under paragraph (b) of this section is liable for the amount of tax not withheld and deposited.
(3)
Use of agents
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), a withholding agent may authorize an agent to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. The acts of an agent of a withholding agent (including the receipt of withholding certificates, the payment of amounts subject to withholding, the withholding and deposit of tax withheld, and the reporting required on the relevant form) are imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it is acting.
(ii)
Authorized agent.
An agent is authorized only if—
(A) There is a written agreement between the withholding agent and the person acting as agent;
(B) A Form 8655, “Reporting Agent Authorization,” is filed with the IRS by a withholding agent if its agent (including any sub-agent) acts as a reporting agent for filing Form 1042 on behalf of the withholding agent and the agent (or sub-agent) identifies itself as the filer on the Form 1042;
(C) Books and records and relevant personnel of the agent (including any sub-agent) are available to the withholding agent (on a continuous basis, including after termination of the relationship) in order to evaluate the withholding agent's compliance with the provisions of chapter 4; and
(D) The withholding agent remains fully liable for the acts of its agent (or
any sub-agent) and does not assert any of the defenses that may otherwise be available, including under common law principles of agency, in order to avoid tax liability under the Code.
(iii)
Liability of withholding agent acting through an agent.
A withholding agent acting through an agent is liable for any failure of the agent, such as a failure to withhold an amount or make a payment of tax, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure had been the failure of the withholding agent. For this purpose, the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the withholding agent. Except as otherwise provided in the QI, WP, or WT agreement, an agent of a withholding agent is subject to the same withholding and reporting obligations that apply to any withholding agent under the provisions of chapter 4 and does not benefit from the special procedures or exceptions that apply to a QI, WP, or WT. If the agent is a foreign person, however, a U.S. withholding agent may treat the acts of the foreign agent as its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with the provisions of chapter 4. The withholding agent's liability under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will exist even if the agent is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 4. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.
(4)
Liability for failure to obtain documentation timely or to act in accordance with applicable presumptions
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with documentation on the date of payment and that does not withhold under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), or withholds at less than the 30 percent rate prescribed, is liable under this section for the tax required to be withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b) (including interest, penalties, or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold) unless—
(A) The withholding agent has appropriately relied on the presumptions described in § 1.1471-3(f) in order to treat the payment as exempt from withholding; or
(B) The withholding agent obtained after the date of payment valid documentation that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(c)(7) to establish that the payment was, in fact, exempt from withholding.
(ii)
Withholding satisfied by another withholding agent.
If a withholding agent fails to deduct and withhold any amount required to be deducted and withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), and the tax is satisfied by another withholding agent or is otherwise paid, then the amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the first-mentioned withholding agent. However, the withholding agent is not relieved from liability in any such case for any interest or penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold.
(b)
Payment of withheld tax
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), every withholding agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 4 shall deposit such tax within the time provided in § 1.6302-2(a) by electronic funds transfer as provided under § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. If for any reason the total amount of tax required to be deposited for any calendar year pursuant to the income tax return described in paragraph (c) of this section has not been deposited pursuant to § 1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall pay the balance of such tax due for such year at such place as the IRS shall specify. The tax shall be paid when filing the return described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for such year, unless the IRS specifies otherwise. See § 1.1471-4(b)(6) for the special rule allowing participating FFIs to set aside in escrow amounts withheld with respect to dormant accounts.
(2)
Special rule for foreign passthru payments and payments of gross proceeds that include an undetermined amount of income subject to tax.
[Reserved]
(c)
Income tax return
—(1)
In general.
Every withholding agent shall file an income tax return on Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report chapter 4 reportable amounts (as defined in paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of this section). This income tax return shall be filed on the same income tax return used to report amounts subject to reporting for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1461-1(b). The return must show the aggregate amount of payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts and must report the tax withheld for the preceding calendar year by the withholding agent, in addition to any information required by the form and its accompanying instructions. Withholding certificates and other statements or information provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. A Form 1042 must be filed under this paragraph (c)(1) even if no tax was required to be withheld for chapter 4 purposes during the preceding calendar year. The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for the applicable period of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to the amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the applicable period of limitations. Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld described in § 1.1474-2 shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form and its accompanying instructions.
(2)
Participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, and U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons.
A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI shall file Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to report chapter 4 reportable amounts for which the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is required to file Form 1042-S, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person must exclude from Form 1042 payments made and taxes withheld by such U.S. branch. A U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person shall file a separate Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the instructions on the form to report chapter 4 reportable amounts.
(3)
Amended returns.
An amended return under this paragraph (c)(3) must be filed on Form 1042. An amended return must include such information as the form or its accompanying instructions shall require, including, with respect to any information that has changed from the time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the original return and the corrected information.
(d)
Information returns for payment reporting
—(1)
Filing requirement
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section or in the instructions to Form 1042-S, every withholding agent must file an information return on Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report to the IRS chapter 4 reportable amounts as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that were paid to a recipient during the preceding calendar year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B) (certain unknown recipients) and (d)(4)(i)(B) and (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section (describing payees includable in reporting pools of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI), a separate Form 1042-S must be filed with the IRS for each recipient of an amount subject to reporting under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and for each separate type of payment made to a single recipient in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and its accompanying instructions prescribe. One copy of the Form 1042-S shall be filed with the IRS on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid, with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions to the form. Withholding certificates, certifications, documentary evidence, or other statements or documentation provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the form. A copy of the Form 1042-S must be furnished to the recipient for whom the form is prepared (or any other person, as required under this paragraph or the instructions to the form) and to any intermediary or flow-through entity described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject
to reporting was paid. A person required by this paragraph (d)(1)(i) to furnish a copy of Form 1042-S to the recipient for whom it is prepared may furnish the copy of Form 1042-S in an electronic format in lieu of a paper format provided it meets the requirements of § 1.1461-1(c)(1)(i)(A). The withholding agent must retain a copy of each Form 1042-S for the period of limitations on assessment and collection applicable to the tax reportable on the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates (determined as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the additional reporting requirements of participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs.

(A) An amount of a withholdable payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 4 paid after June 30, 2014;
(B) An amount of a withholdable payment of U.S. source FDAP income (including an amount that would be a withholdable payment but for the fact that it is an amount effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, as described in § 1.1471-3(a)(4)(ii)) that is also reportable on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(i); or

(ii)
Exception to reporting.

A chapter 4 reportable amount does, however, include an amount paid to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI to the extent allocable to its reporting pool of payees that are U.S. persons as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Coordination with chapter 3.

The Form 1042-S must include the following information, if applicable—
(i) The name, address, and EIN or GIIN (as applicable) of the withholding agent (as required on the instructions to the form) and the withholding agent's status for chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes (as defined in the instructions to the form);
(ii) A description of each category of income or payment made based on the income and payment codes provided on the form (for example, interest, dividends, and gross proceeds) and the aggregate amount in each category expressed in U.S. dollars;

(4)
Method of reporting
—(i)
Payments by U.S. withholding agent to recipients.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4) or on the Form 1042-S and its accompanying instructions, a withholding agent that is a U.S. person (including a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person and excluding a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is a QI) and that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount must file a separate form for each recipient that receives such amount. Except as otherwise provided on Form 1042-S or its instructions, only payments for which the income or payment code, exemption code, withholding rate, and recipient code are the same may be reported on a single form filed with the IRS. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section for reporting of payments made to a person that is not a recipient and that is otherwise required to be reported on Form 1042-S.
(A)
Payments to certain entities that are beneficial owners.
If the beneficial owner of a payment made by a U.S. withholding agent is an exempt beneficial owner, an FFI, an NFFE, or a territory entity, it must complete Form 1042-S treating such entity as the recipient of the payment.
(B)
Payments to participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, and certain QIs.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B), a U.S. withholding agent that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT must complete a Form 1042-S treating such FFI as the recipient. With respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT or QI that elects to be withheld upon under section 1471(b)(3) and from whom the withholding agent receives an FFI withholding statement allocating the payment (or portion of the payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool, a U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) as the recipient with respect to each such pool identified on an FFI withholding statement, described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
). If, however, a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) has made an election under § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii), for the portion of the payment that the FFI allocates to each recalcitrant account holder that is subject to backup withholding under section 3406, the withholding agent must report on Form 1099 the amount of the payment and tax withheld in accordance with the form's requirements and accompanying instructions. See § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(i) for the requirement of a withholding agent to withhold on payments of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii) in the case of
payments made to a QI. See § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required under that section for U.S. source FDAP income that is reportable on Form 1042-S under chapter 3 and not subject to withholding under chapter 4, in which case the U.S. withholding agent must report in the manner described under § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for reporting rules applicable if participating FFIs or deemed-compliant FFIs provide specific payee information for reporting to the recipient of the payment for Form 1042-S reporting purposes. See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the residual reporting responsibilities of an NQI, NWP, or NWT that is an FFI.
(C)
Amounts paid to a U.S. branch.
A U.S. withholding agent making a payment of U.S. source FDAP income to a U.S. branch shall complete Form 1042-S as follows—
(
1
) If the U.S. branch is treated as a U.S. person, if the withholding agent treats amounts paid as effectively connected with the conduct of the branch's trade or business in the United States, or if the U.S. branch is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S reporting the U.S. branch as the recipient;
(
2
) If the U.S. branch of an FFI is not treated as a U.S. person and applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding its reporting pools referenced in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section or information regarding each recipient that is an account holder or payee of the U.S. branch, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the U.S. branch for each such pool to the extent required on the form and its accompanying instructions or must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to each recipient whose documentation is associated with the U.S. branch's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and report the U.S. branch as an entity not treated as a recipient; or
(
3
) If the U.S. branch of an FFI is not treated as a U.S. person and applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) to the extent it fails to provide sufficient information regarding its account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient to the extent recipient information is not provided and report the U.S. branch as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.
(D)
Amounts paid to territory financial institutions that are flow-through entities or acting as intermediaries.
A U.S. withholding agent making a withholdable payment to a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary must complete Form 1042-S as follows—
(
1
) If the territory financial institution is treated as a U.S. person or is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S treating the territory financial institution as the recipient;
(
2
) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding each recipient that is an partner, beneficiary, owner, account holder, or payee, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient whose documentation is associated with the territory financial institution's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and must report the territory financial institution under that paragraph; or
(
3
) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person, to the extent its fails to provide sufficient information regarding its partners, beneficiaries, owners, account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the territory financial institution as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.
(E)
Amounts paid to NFFEs.
A U.S. withholding agent that makes payments of chapter 4 reportable amounts to an excepted or passive NFFE shall complete Forms 1042-S treating the NFFE as the recipient, except when the
NFFE is a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary and the partner or beneficiary is treated as the payee. In cases in which the chapter 4 reportable amount is also an amount of U.S. source FDAP income reportable on Form 1042-S (described in § 1.1441-2(a)), see also § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required with respect to the partners, beneficiaries, or owners of such entities.
(ii)
Payments made by withholding agents to certain entities that are not recipients
—(A)
Entities that provide information for a withholding agent to perform specific payee reporting.
If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a flow-through entity that is a passive NFFE, a nonparticipating FFI receiving a payment on behalf of an exempt beneficial owner, or a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient that is a partner, beneficiary, owner, or account holder of such entity to the extent the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation (under the rules of § 1.1471-3(c) and (d)) provided by such entity, as applicable, with respect to each such recipient. If a payment is made through tiers of such entities, the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the recipient to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with documentation provided with respect to that recipient. A withholding agent that is completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient described in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) must include on the form the information described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section for the entity through which the recipient directly receives the payment.
(B)
Nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or intermediary.
If a withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a nonparticipating FFI that it is required to treat as an intermediary with regard to a payment or as a flow-through entity under rules described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)(

)(
x
) of this section (relating to an exempt beneficial owner), the withholding agent must report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the nonparticipating FFI as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.
(C)
Disregarded entities.
If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment to a disregarded entity and receives a valid withholding certificate or other documentary evidence from the person that is the single owner of such disregarded entity, the withholding agent must file a Form 1042-S treating the single owner as the recipient in accordance with the instructions to the Form 1042-S.
(iii)
Reporting by participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs (including QIs, WPs, and WTs) and U.S. branches of FFIs not treated as U.S. persons
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B) (relating to NQIs, NWPs, NWTs, and FFIs electing under section 1471(b)(3)) and § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F) (relating to transitional payee-specific reporting for payments to nonparticipating FFIs), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT), and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) that makes a payment that is a chapter 4 reportable amount to a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI must complete a Form 1042-S to report such payments. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT), and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) may report in pools consisting of its recalcitrant account holders and payees that are nonparticipating FFIs. With respect to recalcitrant account holders, the FFI may report in pools consisting of recalcitrant account holders within a particular status described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) and within a particular income code. Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), with respect to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs, the FFI may report in pools consisting of one or more nonparticipating FFIs that fall within a particular income
code and within a particular status code described in the instructions to Form 1042-S. Alternatively, a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT) and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) may (and a certified deemed-compliant FFI is required to) perform payee-specific reporting to report a chapter 4 reportable amount paid to a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI when withholding was applied (or should have applied) to the payment.
(B)
Special reporting requirements of participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, FFIs that make an election under section 1471(b)(3), and U.S. branches of FFIs not treated as U.S. persons.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) or an FFI that has made an election under section 1471(b)(3) and has provided sufficient information to its withholding agent to withhold and report the payment is not required to report the payment on Form 1042-S as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section if the payment is made to a nonparticipating FFI or recalcitrant account holder and its withholding agent has withheld the correct amount of tax on such payment and correctly reported the payment on a Form 1042-S. Such FFI or branch is required to report a payment, however, when the FFI knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld by the withholding agent on the payment or the withholding agent has not correctly reported the payment on Form 1042-S. In such case, the FFI or branch must report on Form 1042-S to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. See, however, § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the requirement to report certain aggregate information regarding accounts held by recalcitrant account holders on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” regardless of whether withholdable payments are made to such accounts.
(C)
Reporting by a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person.
A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(135)) must report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Reporting by territory financial institutions.
A territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person will not be required to report on Form 1042-S if another withholding agent has reported the same amount with regard to the same recipient for which such entity would otherwise be required to file a return under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) and such withholding agent has withheld the entire amount required to be withheld from such payment. A territory financial institution must, however, report payments made to recipients for whom it has failed to provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent or to the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld. A territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person or is otherwise required under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) to report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S must report in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent.
(v)
Nonparticipating FFIs.
A nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to a payment may file Forms 1042 and 1042-S only to report and allocate tax withheld to the account holders, partners, owners, or beneficiaries of the nonparticipating FFI.
(vi)
Other withholding agents.
Any person that is a withholding agent that is not described in any of paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (v) of this section shall file Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent and in accordance with the instructions to the form.
(vii)
Combined Form 1042-S reporting.
A withholding agent required to report on Form 1042-S under paragraph (d)(4) of this section (other than a nonparticipating FFI reporting under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section) may rely on the procedures used for chapter
3 purposes (provided in published guidance) for reporting on Form 1042-S (even if the withholding agent is not required to report under chapter 3) for combined reporting following a merger or acquisition, provided that all of the requirements for such reporting provided in the Instructions for Form 1042-S are satisfied.
(e)
Reporting in electronic form.
See §§ 301.6011-2(b) and 301.6011-15 of this chapter, which apply for purposes of this section, for the requirements of a withholding agent that is not a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042-S and Form 1042 in electronic form. See § 301.1474-1(a) of this chapter for the requirements applicable to a withholding agent that is a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042 and 1042-S in electronic form.
(f)
Indemnification of withholding agent.
A withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. A withholding agent that withholds based on a reasonable belief that such withholding is required under chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder is treated for purposes of section 1474 and this paragraph (f) as having withheld tax in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. This paragraph (f) does not relieve a withholding agent from tax liability under chapter 3 or chapter 4 or the regulations under those chapters.
(g)
Extensions of time to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S.
The IRS may grant an extension of time to file Form 1042 or 1042-S as described in § 1.1461-1(g).
(h)
Penalties.
For penalties and additions to tax for failure to file returns or file and furnish statements in accordance with this section, see sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203, and the regulations under those sections. For penalties and additions to tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be withheld under chapter 4, see sections 6656, 6672, 7202, and the regulations under those sections.

Reporting by certain withholding agents with respect to U.S. owned foreign entities that are passive NFFEs.
Beginning on July 1, 2014, in addition to the reporting on Form 1042-S required under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(E) of this section, a withholding agent (other than an FFI reporting accounts held by NFFEs under § 1.1471-4(d)) that makes a withholdable payment to, and receives information about any substantial U.S. owners of, a passive NFFE that is not an excepted NFFE as defined in § 1.1472-1(c) shall file a report with the IRS for the period from July 1 through December 31, 2014, and in each subsequent calendar year in which a withholdable payment is made with respect to any substantial U.S. owners of such NFFE. Such report must be made on Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and filed on or before March 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the withholdable payment was made. A withholding agent is not required to report under this paragraph (i)(2) on a withholdable payment made to a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is allocated to a payee that is a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners on an FFI withholding statement when the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI includes on the statement the certification described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(

)(
iv
), provided that the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. In the case of an entity to which the preceding sentence does not apply that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary receiving a withholdable payment allocable to a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners, the entity is not required to report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2) if it provides to the withholding agent from which it receives the payment documentation sufficient for the withholding agent to report information with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2), provided that the intermediary or flow-through entity does not know or have reason to know that the withholding agent does not report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2). The report must contain the following information—
(i) Name of the NFFE that is owned by a substantial U.S. owner;

(4)
Extensions of time to file.
The IRS shall grant an automatic 90-day extension of time in which to file Form 8966 as required under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section. Form 8809-I, “Application of Extension of Time to File FATCA Form 8966,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) must be used to request such extension of time and must be filed no later than
the due date of Form 8966. Under certain hardship conditions, the IRS may grant an additional 90-day extension. A request for extension due to hardship must contain a statement of the reasons for requesting the extension and such other information as the form or instructions may require.

[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5985, Jan. 28, 2013; 78 FR 55208, Sept. 10, 2013, as amended by T.D. 9657, 79 FR 12862, Mar. 6, 2014; T.D. 9809, 82 FR 2188, Jan. 6, 2017; 82 FR 29729, June 30, 2017; T.D. 9890, 85 FR 206, Jan. 2, 2020; T.D. 9972, 88 FR 11763, Feb. 23, 2023]
§ 1.1474-2
Adjustments for overwithholding or underwithholding of tax.
(a)
Adjustments of overwithheld tax
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided by this section, a withholding agent that has overwithheld tax under chapter 4 and made a deposit of the tax as provided in § 1.6302-2(a) may adjust the amount of overwithheld tax either pursuant to the reimbursement procedure described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or pursuant to the set-off procedure described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Adjustments under this paragraph (a) may only be made within the time prescribed under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section. After such time, a refund of the amount of overwithheld tax can only be claimed pursuant to the procedures described in § 1.1474-5 and chapter 65 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Overwithholding.
For purposes of this section, the term
overwithholding
means an amount actually withheld (determined before application of the adjustment procedures under this section and regardless of whether such overwithholding was in error or appeared correct at the time it occurred) from an item of income or other payment pursuant to chapter 4 that is in excess of the greater of—
(i) The amount required to be withheld with respect to such item of income or other payment under chapter 4; and
(ii) The actual tax liability of the beneficial owner that is attributable to the income or payment from which the amount was withheld.
(3)
Reimbursement of tax
—(i)
General rule.
Under the reimbursement procedure, the withholding agent may repay the beneficial owner or payee for an amount of overwithheld tax. In such case, the withholding agent may reimburse itself by reducing, by the amount actually repaid to the beneficial owner or payee, the amount of any deposit of tax made by the withholding agent under § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii) for any subsequent payment period occurring before the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding. A withholding agent must obtain valid documentation as described under § 1.1471-3(c)(6) with respect to the beneficial owner or payee supporting a reduced rate of withholding before reducing the amount of any deposit of tax under this paragraph (a)(3)(i). Any such reduction that occurs for a payment period in the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding shall be allowed only if—
(A) The repayment of the beneficial owner or payee occurs before the earlier of the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S is actually filed with the IRS;
(B) The withholding agent states on a timely filed (not including extensions) Form 1042-S the amount of tax withheld and the amount of any actual repayment; and
(C) The withholding agent states on a timely filed (not including extensions) Form 1042 for the calendar year of overwithholding that the filing of the Form 1042 constitutes a claim for credit in accordance with § 1.6414-1.
(ii)
Record maintenance.
If the beneficial owner or payee is repaid an amount of overwithheld tax under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3), the withholding agent shall keep as part of its records a receipt showing the date and amount of repayment, and the withholding agent must provide a copy of such receipt to the beneficial owner or payee. For this purpose, a canceled
check or an entry in a statement is sufficient, provided that the check or statement contains a specific notation that it is a refund of tax overwithheld.
(4)
Set-offs.
Under the set-off procedure, the withholding agent may repay the beneficial owner or payee for an amount of overwithheld tax by applying the amount overwithheld against any amount which otherwise would be required under chapter 3 or 4 to be withheld from the amount paid by the withholding agent to such person before the earlier of the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S is actually filed with the IRS. For purposes of making a return on Form 1042 or 1042-S (or an amended form) for the calendar year of overwithholding and for purposes of making a deposit of the amount withheld, the reduced amount shall be considered the amount required to be withheld from such payment under chapter 3 or 4, respectively.
(5)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Fund A is a unit investment trust that is an FFI and a resident of Country X. Fund A also qualifies for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and Country X. On December 1, 2016, domestic corporation C pays a dividend of $100 to Fund A, at which time C withholds $30 of tax pursuant to § 1.1471-2(a) and remits the balance of $70 to Fund A, because it does not hold valid documentation that Fund A is a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI. On February 10, 2017, prior to the time that C is obligated to file its Form 1042, Fund A furnishes a valid Form W-8BEN described in §§ 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) and 1.1471-3(c)(3)(ii) upon which C may rely to treat Fund A as the beneficial owner of the income and as a participating FFI so that C may reduce the rate of withholding to 15% under the provisions of the United States-Country X income tax treaty with respect to the payment. C repays the excess tax withheld of $15 to Fund A.
(ii) During the 2016 calendar year, C makes no other payments upon which tax is required to be withheld under chapter 3 or 4; accordingly, its Form 1042 for such year, filed on March 15, 2017, shows total tax withheld of $30, an adjusted total tax withheld of $15, and tax deposited of $30 for such year. Pursuant to § 1.6414-1, C claims a credit for the overpayment of $15 shown on the Form 1042 for 2016. Accordingly, C is permitted to reduce by $15 any deposit required by § 1.6302-2 to be made of tax withheld during the 2017 calendar year with respect to taxes due under chapter 3 or 4. The Form 1042-S required to be filed by C with respect to the dividend of $100 paid to Fund A in 2016 is required to show tax withheld of $30 and tax repaid of $15 to Fund A.

# Example 2.
(i) In November 2016, Bank A, a foreign bank organized in Country X that is an NQI, receives on behalf of one of its account holders, Z, an individual, a $100 dividend payment from C, a domestic corporation. At the time of payment, C withholds $30 pursuant to § 1.1471-2(a) and remits the balance of $70 to Bank A, because it does not hold valid documentation that it may rely on to treat Bank A as a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI. In December 2016, prior to the time that C files its Forms 1042 and 1042-S, Bank A furnishes a valid Form W-8IMY and FFI withholding statement described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii) that establishes Bank A's status as a participating FFI that is an NQI, as well as a valid Form W-8BEN that has been completed by Z as described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(ii) and § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) upon which C may rely to treat the payment as made to Z, a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of Country X eligible for a reduced rate of withholding of 15% under the income tax treaty between the United States and Country X. Although C has already deposited the $30 that was withheld, as required by § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iv), C remits the amount of $15 to Bank A for the benefit of Z.
(ii) During the 2016 calendar year, C makes no other payments upon which tax is required to be withheld under chapter 3 or 4; accordingly, its return on Form 1042 for such year, which is filed on March 15, 2017, shows total tax withheld of $30, an adjusted total tax withheld of $15, and tax deposited of $30. Pursuant to § 1.6414-1(b), C claims a credit for the overpayment of $15 shown on the Form 1042 for 2014. Accordingly, it is permitted to reduce by $15 any deposit required by § 1.6302-2 to be made of tax withheld during the 2017 calendar year. The Form 1042-S required to be filed by C for 2016 with respect to the dividend of $100 beneficially owned by Z is required to show tax withheld of $30 and tax repaid of $15 to Z.
(b)
Withholding of additional tax when underwithholding occurs.
A withholding agent that has underwithheld under chapter 4 may apply the procedures described in § 1.1461-2(b) (by substituting the term “chapter 4” for “chapter 3”) to satisfy its withholding obligations under chapter 4 with respect to a payee or beneficial owner.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies January 28, 2013.
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5991, Jan. 28, 2013]
§ 1.1474-3
Withheld tax as credit to beneficial owner of income.
(a)
Creditable tax.
The entire amount of the income, if any, attributable to a payment from which tax is required to be withheld under chapter 4 (including income deemed paid by a withholding agent under § 1.1473-1(a)(2)(v)) shall be included in gross income in a return required to be made by the beneficial owner of the income, without deduction for the amount required to be or actually withheld, but the amount of tax actually withheld shall be allowed as a credit against the total income tax computed in the beneficial owner's return.
(b)
Amounts paid to persons that are not the beneficial owners.
Amounts actually deducted and withheld under chapter 4 on payments made to a fiduciary, agent, partnership, trust, or intermediary are deemed to have been paid by the beneficial owner of the item of income or other payment subject to withholding under chapter 4, except when the fiduciary, agent, partnership, trust, or intermediary pays the tax from its own funds and does not in turn withhold with respect to the payment made to such person. Thus, for example, if a beneficiary of a trust is subject to the taxes imposed by section 1, 2, 3, or 11 upon any amount of distributable net income or other taxable distribution received from a foreign trust, the part of any amount withheld at source under chapter 4 that is properly allocable to the income so taxed to such beneficiary shall be credited against the amount of the income tax computed upon the beneficiary's return, and any excess shall be refunded to the beneficiary in accordance with § 1.1474-5 and chapter 65 of the Code.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies January 28, 2013.
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5992, Jan. 28, 2013]
§ 1.1474-4
Tax paid only once.
(a)
Tax paid.
If the tax required to be withheld under chapter 4 on a payment is paid by the payee, beneficial owner, or the withholding agent, it shall not be re-collected from any other, regardless of the original liability therefor. However, this section does not relieve a person that was required to, but did not, withhold tax from liability for interest or any penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies January 28, 2013.
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5992, Jan. 28, 2013]
§ 1.1474-5
Refunds or credits.
(a)
Refund and credit
—(1)
In general.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in this section, a refund or credit of tax which has actually been withheld at the source at the time of payment under chapter 4 shall be made to the beneficial owner of the payment to which the amount of withheld tax is attributable if the beneficial owner or payee meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and any other requirements that may be required under chapter 65. To the extent that the amount withheld under chapter 4 is not actually withheld at source, but is later paid by the withholding agent to the IRS, the refund or credit under chapter 65 of the Code shall be made to the withholding agent to the extent the withholding agent provides documentation with respect to the beneficial owner or payee described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section sufficient for the beneficial owner or payee to have obtained a refund of the tax and sufficient for the withholding agent to have applied a reduced rate or exemption from withholding under chapter 4. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a nonparticipating FFI that is acting as a withholding agent with respect to one or more of its account holders. In such a case, only the account holders of the nonparticipating FFI will be entitled to a credit or refund of an amount withheld under chapter 4, to the extent otherwise allowable under this section. Additionally, there are collective refund procedures for a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI to claim a refund or credit on behalf of certain direct account holders that are beneficial owners of the payment under § 1.1471-4(h) (in lieu of such account holders claiming refund or credit under this paragraph (a)(1)).
(2)
Limitation to refund and credit for a nonparticipating FFI.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a nonparticipating FFI (determined as of the time of payment) that is the beneficial owner of an item of income or other payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 4 shall not be entitled to any credit or refund pursuant to section 1474(b)(2) and this section unless it is entitled to a reduced rate of tax with respect to the income or other payment by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States. If the nonparticipating FFI is entitled to a reduced rate of tax with respect to an item of income or other payment by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States, the amount of any credit or refund with respect to such tax shall not exceed the amount of credit or refund attributable to such reduction in rate on the item of income or other payment, and no interest otherwise allowable under section 6611 shall be allowed or paid with respect to such credit or refund.
(3)
Requirement to provide additional documentation for certain beneficial owners
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, no refund or credit shall be allowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the beneficial owner of the income or other payment to which the amount of such withheld tax was attributable if such beneficial owner is an NFFE, unless the NFFE attaches to its income tax return the information described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Claim of reduced withholding under an income tax treaty.
Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent that the beneficial owner is entitled to a reduced rate of tax with respect to the income or other payment by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States.
(iii)
Additional documentation to be furnished to the IRS for certain NFFEs.
The information described in this paragraph (a)(3)(iii) is—
(A) A certification that the beneficial owner does not have any substantial U.S. owners;
(B) The form described in § 1.1474-1(i)(2) relating to each substantial U.S. owner of such entity; or
(C) Other appropriate documentation to establish withholding was not required under chapter 4.
(b)
Tax repaid to payee.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6414-1, any amount of tax withheld under chapter 4, which, pursuant to § 1.1474-2(a)(1), is repaid by the withholding agent to the beneficial owner of the income or payment to which the withheld amount is attributable shall be considered as tax which, within the meaning of sections 1474 and 6414, was not actually withheld by the withholding agent.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies January 28, 2013.
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5992, Jan. 28, 2013]
§ 1.1474-6
Coordination of chapter 4 with other withholding provisions.
(a)
In general.
This section coordinates the withholding requirements of a withholding agent when a withholdable payment or foreign passthru payment is subject to withholding under both chapter 4 and another Code provision. See § 1.1473-1(a) for the definition of withholdable payment and see § 1.1471-5(h)(2) for the definition of foreign passthru payment.
(b)
Coordination of withholding for amounts subject to withholding under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a withholdable payment that is both subject to withholding under chapter 4 and is an amount subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a), a withholding agent may credit the withholding applied under chapter 4 against its liability for any tax due under sections 1441, 1442, or 1443. See § 1.1474-1(c) and (d) for the income tax return and information return reporting requirements that apply in the case of a payment that is a withholdable payment subject to withholding under chapter 4 that is also an amount subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a).
(2)
When withholding is applied.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, withholding is applied by a withholding agent under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) or chapter 4 (as applicable) when the withholding agent has withheld on the payment and has designated the withholding as having been made under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) or chapter 4 to the extent required in the reporting described
in § 1.1474-1(c) and (d). For purposes of allowing an offset of withholding and allowing a credit to a withholding agent against its liability for such tax as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, withholding is treated as applied for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section only when the withholding agent has actually withheld on a payment and has not made any adjustment for overwithheld tax applicable to the amount withheld that would otherwise be permitted with respect to the payment.
(3)
Special rule for certain substitute dividend payments.
In the case of a dividend equivalent under section 871(m) paid pursuant to a securities lending transaction described in section 1058 (or a substantially similar transaction), or pursuant to a sale-repurchase transaction, a withholding agent may offset its obligation to withhold under chapter 4 for amounts withheld by another withholding agent under chapters 3 and 4 with respect to the same underlying security in such a transaction, but only to the extent that there is sufficient evidence as required under chapter 3 that tax was actually withheld on a prior dividend equivalent paid to the withholding agent or a prior withholding agent with respect to the same underlying security in such transaction.
(c)
Coordination with amounts subject to withholding under section 1445
—(1)
In general.
An amount subject to withholding under section 1445 is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(2)
Determining the amount of the distribution from certain domestic corporations subject to section 1445 or chapter 4 withholding
—(i)
Distribution from qualified investment entity.
In the case of a passthru payment (including a withholdable payment) subject to withholding under chapter 4 that is a distribution with respect to the stock of a qualified investment entity as described in section 897(h)(4)(A), withholding under chapter 4 does not apply when withholding under section 1445 applies to such amounts. With respect to the portion of such distribution that is not subject to withholding under section 1445 but is subject to withholding under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and chapter 4, the coordination rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply.
(ii)
Distribution from a United States real property holding corporation.
A distribution (or portion of a distribution) from a United States real property holding corporation (or from a corporation that was a United States real property holding corporation at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution) with respect to its stock that is a United States real property interest under section 897(c) is subject to withholding under chapter 4 and is also subject to the withholding provisions of section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and section 1445. In such case, to the extent that the United States real property holding corporation chooses to withhold on a distribution only under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) pursuant to § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(A), the coordination rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply to such distribution. Alternatively, to the extent that the United States real property holding corporation chooses to withhold under both section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and section 1445 pursuant to § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B), the coordination rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply to the portion of such distribution described in § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B)(1), and withholding under section 1445 shall apply to the amount of such distribution described in § 1.1441-3(c)(4)(i)(B)(2). A withholding agent other than a United States real property holding corporation may rely, absent actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise, on the representations of the United States real property holding corporation making the distribution regarding the portion of the distribution that is estimated to be a dividend under § 1.1441-3(c)(2)(ii)(A), and in the case of a failure by the withholding agent to withhold under chapter 4 due to this reliance, the required amount shall be imputed to the United States real property holding corporation.
(d)
Coordination with section 1446
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a withholdable payment or a foreign passthru payment subject to withholding under section 1446 shall not be subject to withholding under chapter 4. See § 1.1473-1(a)(4)(ii) for the exclusion from withholdable payment and the requirements for such exclusion for any item of income that is taken into account under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) for the taxable year.
(2)
Determining the amount of distribution subject to section 1446.
[Reserved]
(e)
Example. Chapter 4 withholding satisfies chapter 3 withholding obligation.
WA, a U.S. withholding agent, makes a payment consisting of a dividend from sources within the United States to NPFFI. NPFFI is a nonparticipating FFI that is a resident of Country X, a country that has an income tax treaty in force with the United States that would allow WA to reduce the rate of withholding for section 1442 purposes on a payment of U.S. source dividends paid to NPFFI to 15%. Because the payment is a withholdable payment and NPFFI is a nonparticipating FFI, WA withholds on the payment at the rate of 30% under chapter 4. WA does not make any adjustment for overwithholding that is otherwise permitted with respect to this payment. Although the payment is also an amount subject to withholding under section 1442, WA is not required to withhold any tax on this payment under section 1442. WA may credit its withholding applied under chapter 4 against the amount of tax otherwise required to be withheld on this payment under section 1442. See § 1.1474-5(a)(2) for the credit and refund procedures for nonparticipating FFIs that are entitled to a reduced rate of tax with respect to an amount subject to withholding under chapter 4 by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States.
(f)
Coordination with section 3406.
A participating FFI that makes a withholdable payment that is also a reportable payment (as defined in the relevant sections of chapter 61) to a recalcitrant account holder that is a U.S. non-exempt recipient is not required to withhold under section 3406 if it withholds on the payment at a 30-percent rate in accordance with its withholding obligations under chapter 4. See, however, § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii) for the election to withhold on recalcitrant account holders that are non-exempt U.S. recipients under section 3406 instead of withholding under chapter 4.
(g)

(a)
Group.
The term
group
means an affiliated group of corporations as defined in section 1504. See § 1.1502-75(d) as to when a group remains in existence. Except as the context otherwise requires, references to a group are references to a consolidated group (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section).
(b)

(c)
Subsidiary.
The term
subsidiary
means a corporation other than the common parent which is a member of such group.
(d)
Consolidated return year.
The term
consolidated return year
means a taxable year for which a consolidated return is filed or required to be filed by such group.
(e)
Separate return year.
The term
separate return year
means a taxable year of a corporation for which it files a separate return or for which it joins in the filing of a consolidated return by another group.
(f)
Separate return limitation year
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the term
separate return limitation year
(or
SRLY
) means any separate return year of a member or of a predecessor of a member.
(2)
Exceptions.
The term
separate return limitation year
(or SRLY) does not include:
(i) A separate return year of the corporation which is the common parent for the consolidated return year to which the tax attribute is to be carried (except as provided in § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) and paragraph (f)(3) of this section);
(ii) A separate return year of any corporation which was a member of the group for each day of such year; or
(iii) A separate return year of a predecessor of any member if such predecessor was a member of the group for each day of such year.
(3)
Reverse acquisitions.
In the event of an acquisition to which § 1.1502-75(d)(3) applies, all taxable years of the first corporation and of each of its subsidiaries ending on or before the date of the acquisition are treated as separate return limitation years, and the separate return years (if any) of the second corporation and each of its subsidiaries are not treated as separate return limitation years (unless they were so treated immediately before the acquisition). For example, if corporation P merges into corporation T, and the persons who were stockholders of P immediately before the merger, as a result of owning the stock of P, own more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of T, then a loss incurred before the merger by T (even though it is the common parent), or by a subsidiary of T, is treated as having been incurred in a separate return limitation year. Conversely, a loss incurred before the merger by P, or by a subsidiary of P in a separate return year during all of which such subsidiary was a member of the group of which P was the common parent, is treated as having been incurred in a year which is not a separate return limitation year.

# Consolidated Tax Liability
§ 1.1502-2
Computation of tax liability.
(a)
Taxes imposed.
The tax liability of a group for a consolidated return year is determined by adding together—
(1) The tax imposed by section 11(a) in the amount described in section 11(b) on the consolidated taxable income for the year (reduced by the taxable income of a member described in paragraphs (a)(5) through (8) of this section);
(2) The tax imposed by section 541 on the consolidated undistributed personal holding company income;
(3) If paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, the aggregate of the taxes imposed by section 541 on the separate undistributed personal holding company income of the members which are personal holding companies;
(4) If neither paragraph (a)(2) nor (3) of this section apply, the tax imposed by section 531 on the consolidated accumulated taxable income (see § 1.1502-43);
(5) The tax imposed by section 594(a) in lieu of the taxes imposed by section 11 on the taxable income of a life insurance department of the common parent of a group which is a mutual savings bank;
(6) The tax imposed by section 801 on consolidated life insurance company taxable income;
(7) The tax imposed by section 831(a) on consolidated insurance company taxable income of the members which are subject to such tax;
(8) Any increase in tax described in section 1351(d)(1) (relating to recoveries of foreign expropriation losses); and
(9) The tax imposed by section 59A on base erosion payments of taxpayers with substantial gross receipts.
(b)
Credits.
A group is allowed as a credit against the taxes described in paragraph (a) of this section (except for paragraph (a)(9) of this section) of this section: The general business credit under section 38 (see § 1.1502-3), the foreign tax credit under section 27 (see § 1.1502-4), and any other applicable credits provided under the Internal Revenue Code. Any increase in tax due to the recapture of a tax credit will be taken into account. See section 59A and the regulations thereunder for credits allowed against the tax described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(c)
Allocation of dollar amounts.
For purposes of this section, if a member or members of the consolidated group are also members of a controlled group that includes corporations that are not members of the consolidated group, any dollar amount described in any section of the Internal Revenue Code is apportioned among all members of the controlled group in accordance with the provisions of the applicable section and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Applicability date
—This section applies to taxable years for which the original consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extension) after December 6, 2019.
[T.D. 9885, 84 FR 67038, Dec. 6, 2019]
§ 1.1502-3
Consolidated tax credits.
(a)
Determination of amount of consolidated credit
—(1)
In general.
The credit allowed by section 38 for a consolidated return year of a group shall be equal to the consolidated credit earned. The consolidated credit earned is equal to the aggregate of the credit earned (as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) by all members of the group for the consolidated return year.
(2)
Determination of credit earned.
The credit earned of a member is an amount equal to 7 percent of such member's qualified investment (determined under section 46(c)). For purposes of computing a member's qualified investment, the basis of property shall not include any gain or loss realized with respect to such property by another member in an intercompany transaction (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)), whether or not such gain or loss is deferred. Thus, if section 38 property acquired in an intercompany transaction has a basis of $100 to the purchasing member, and if the selling member has a $20 gain with respect to such property, the basis of such property for purposes of computing the purchaser's qualified investment is only $80. Such $80 basis shall also be used for purposes of applying section 47 to such property. See paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Consolidated limitation based on amount of tax.
(i) Notwithstanding the amount of the consolidated credit earned for the taxable year, the consolidated credit allowed by section 38 to the group for the consolidated return year is limited to:
(
a
) So much of the consolidated liability for tax as does not exceed $25,000, plus
(
b
) For taxable years ending on or before March 9, 1967, 25 percent of the consolidated liability for tax in excess of $25,000, or
(
c
) For taxable years ending after March 9, 1967, 50 percent of the consolidated liability for tax in excess of $25,000.
The $25,000 amount referred to in the preceding sentence shall be reduced by any part of such $25,000 amount apportioned under § 1.46-1 to component members of the controlled group (as defined in section 46(a)(5)) which do not join in the filing of the consolidated return. For further rules for computing the limitation based on amount of tax with respect to the suspension period (as defined in section 48(j)), see section 46(a)(2). The amount determined under this subparagraph is referred to in this section as the “consolidated limitation based on amount of tax.”
(ii) If an organization to which section 593 applies or a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a) joins in the filing of the consolidated return, the $25,000 amount referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (reduced as provided in such subdivision) shall be apportioned equally among the members of the group filing the consolidated return. The amount so apportioned equally to any such organization shall then be decreased in accordance with the provisions of section 46(d). Finally, the sum of all such equal portions (as decreased under section 46(d)) of each member of the group shall be substituted for the $25,000 amount referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(4)
Consolidated liability for tax.
For purposes of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the consolidated liability for tax shall be the income tax imposed for the taxable year upon the group by chapter 1 of the Code, reduced by the consolidated foreign tax credit allowable under § 1.1502-4. The tax imposed by section 56 (relating to minimum tax for tax preferences), section 531 (relating to accumulated earnings tax), section 541 (relating to personal holding company tax), and any additional tax imposed by section 1351(d)(1) (relating to recoveries of foreign expropriation losses), shall not be considered tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code. In addition, any increase in tax resulting from the application of section 47 (relating to certain dispositions, etc., of section 38 property) shall not be treated as tax imposed by chapter 1 for purposes of computing the consolidated liability for tax.
(b)
Carryback and carryover of unused credits
—(1)
Allowance of unused credit as consolidated carryback or carryover.
A group shall be allowed to add to the amount allowable as a credit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any consolidated return year an amount
equal to the aggregate of the consolidated investment credit carryovers and carrybacks to such year. The consolidated investment credit carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year shall consist of any consolidated unused credits of the group, plus any unused credits of members of the group arising in separate return years of such members, which may be carried over or back to the taxable year under the principles of section 46(b). However, such consolidated carryovers and carrybacks shall not include any consolidated unused credits apportioned to a corporation for a separate return year pursuant to paragraph (c) of § 1.1502-79 and shall be subject to the limitations contained in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section. A consolidated unused credit for any consolidated return year is the excess of the consolidated credit earned over the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for such year.
(2)
Absorption rules.
For purposes of determining the amount, if any, of an unused credit (whether consolidated or separate) which can be carried to a taxable year (consolidated or separate), the amount of such unused credit which is absorbed in a prior consolidated return year under section 46(b) shall be determined by:
(i) Applying all unused credits which can be carried to such prior year in the order of the taxable years in which such unused credits arose, beginning with the taxable year which ends earliest, and
(ii) Applying all such unused credits which can be carried to such prior year from taxable years ending on the same date on a pro rata basis.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) Corporation P is incorporated on January 1, 1966. On that same day P incorporates corporation S, a wholly owned subsidiary. P and S file consolidated returns for calendar years 1966 and 1967. P's and S's credit earned, the consolidated credit earned, and the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1966 and 1967 are as follows:
Credit earned
Consolidated credit earned
Consolidated limitation based on amount of tax
1966:
P
$60,000
S
$30,000
$90,000
$100,000
1967:
P
$40,000
S
$25,000
$65,000
$50,000
(ii) P's and S's credit earned for 1966 are aggregated, and the group's consolidated credit earned, $90,000, is allowable in full to the group as a credit under section 38 for 1966 since such amount is less than the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1966, $100,000.
(iii) Since the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1967 is $50,000, only $50,000 of the $65,000 consolidated credit earned for such year is allowable to the group under section 38 as a credit for 1967. The consolidated unused credit for 1967 of $15,000 ($65,000 less $50,000) is a consolidated investment credit carryback and carryover to the years prescribed in section 46(b). In this case the consolidated unused credit is a consolidated investment credit carryback to 1966 (since P and S were not in existence in 1964 and 1965) and a consolidated investment credit carryover to 1968 and subsequent years. The portion of the consolidated unused credit for 1967 which is allowable as a credit for 1966 is $10,000. This amount shall be added to the amount allowable as a credit to the group for 1966. The balance of the consolidated unused credit for 1967 to be carried to 1968 is $5,000. These amounts are computed as follows:
Consolidated carryback to 1966
$15,000
1966 consolidated limitation based on tax
$100,000
Less: Consolidated credit earned for 1966
$90,000
Consolidated unused credits attributable to years preceding 1967
0
$90,000
Limit on amount of 1967 consolidated unused credit which may be added as a credit for 1966
$10,000
Balance of 1967 consolidated unused credit to be carried to 1968
$5,000
(c)
Limitation on investment credit carryovers and carrybacks from separate return limitation years applicable for consolidated return years for which the due date of the return is on or before March 13, 1998
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of an unused credit of a member of the
group arising in a separate return limitation year (as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)) of such member (and in a separate return limitation year of any predecessor of such member), the amount which may be included under paragraph (b) of this section (computed without regard to the limitation contained in paragraph (e) of this section) shall not exceed the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Computation of limitation.
The amount referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to a member of the group is the excess, if any, of—
(i) The limitation based on amount of tax of the group, minus such limitation recomputed by excluding the items of income, deduction, and foreign tax credit of such member; over
(ii) The sum of the investment credit earned by such member for such consolidated return year, and the unused credits attributable to such member which may be carried to such consolidated return year arising in unused credit years ending prior to the particular separate return limitation year.
(3)
Special effective date.
This paragraph (c) applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998. See paragraph (d) of this section for the rule that limits the group's use of a section 38 credit carryover or carryback from a SRLY for a consolidated return year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998. See also paragraph (d)(4) of this section for an optional effective date rule (generally making the rules of this paragraph (c) inapplicable to a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 1996, if the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) for such year is on or before March 13, 1998).
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Assume the same facts as in the example contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except that all the stock of corporation T, also a calendar year taxpayer, is acquired by P on January 1, 1968, and that P, S, and T file a consolidated return for 1968. In 1966, T had an unused credit of $10,000 which has not been absorbed and is available as an investment credit carryover to 1968. Such carryover is from a separate return limitation year. P's and S's credit earned for 1968 is $10,000 each, and T's credit earned is $8,000; the consolidated credit earned is therefore $28,000. The group's consolidated limitation based on amount of tax for 1968 is $50,000. Such limitation recomputed by excluding the items of income, deduction, and foreign tax credit of T is $30,000. Thus, the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is $20,000 ($50,000 minus $30,000). Accordingly, the limitation on the carryover of T's unused credit is $12,000, the excess of $20,000 over $8,000 (the sum of T's credit earned for the taxable year and any carryovers from prior unused credit years (none in this case)). Therefore T's $10,000 unused credit from 1966 may be carried over to the consolidated return year without limitation.
(ii) The group's consolidated credit earned for 1968, $28,000, is allowable in full as a credit under section 38 since such amount is less than the consolidated limitation based on amount of tax, $50,000.
(iii) The group's consolidated investment credit carryover to 1968 is $15,000, consisting of the consolidated unused credits of the group ($5,000) plus T's separate return year unused credit ($10,000). The entire $15,000 consolidated carryover shall be added to the amount allowable to the group as a credit under section 38 for 1968, since such amount is less than $22,000 (the excess of the consolidated limitation based on tax, $50,000, over the sum of the consolidated credit earned for 1968, $28,000, and unused credits arising in prior unused credit years, zero).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is $12,000. Therefore, the limitation on the carryover of T's unused credit is $4,000. Accordingly, the consolidated investment credit carryover is only $9,000 since the amount of T's separate return year unused credit which may be added to the group's $ 5,000 consolidated unused credit is $4,000. These amounts are computed as follows:
T's carryover to 1968
$10,000
Consolidated limitation based on amount of tax minus recomputed limitation
$12,000
Less: T's credit earned for 1968
$8,000
Unused credits attributable to T arising in unused credit years preceding 1966
0
$8,000
Limit on amount of 1966 unused credit of T which may be added to consolidated investment credit carryover
$4,000
Balance of 1966 unused credit of T to be carried to 1969 (subject to the limitation contained in paragraph (c) of this section)
$6,000
(d)
Limitation on tax credit carryovers and carrybacks from separate return limitation years applicable for consolidated return years for which the due date of the return is after March 13, 1998
—(1)
General rule.
The aggregate of a member's unused section 38 credits arising in SRLYs that are included in the consolidated section 38 credits for all consolidated return years of the group may not exceed—
(i) The aggregate for all consolidated return years of the member's contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for each consolidated return year; reduced by
(ii) The aggregate of the member's section 38 credits arising and absorbed in all consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by the member).
(2)
Computational rules
—(i)
Member's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation.
If the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for a consolidated return year is determined by reference to the consolidated tentative minimum tax (see section 38(c)(1)(A)), then a member's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for such year equals the member's share of the consolidated net income tax minus the member's share of the consolidated tentative minimum tax. If the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for a consolidated return year is determined by reference to the consolidated net regular tax liability (see section 38(c)(1)(B)), then a member's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for such year equals the member's share of the consolidated net income tax minus 25 percent of the quantity which is equal to so much of the member's share of the consolidated net regular tax liability less its portion of the $25,000 amount specified in section 38(c)(1)(B). The group computes the member's shares by applying to the respective consolidated amounts the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under § 1.1502-33(d)(3), assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability. The group must make proper adjustments so that taxes and credits not taken into account in computing the limitation under section 38(c) are not taken into account in computing the member's share of the consolidated net income tax, etc. (See, for example, the taxes described in section 26(b) that are disregarded in computing regular tax liability.) Also, the group may apportion all or a part of the $25,000 amount (or lesser amount if reduced by section 38(c)(3)) for any year to one or more members.
(ii)
Years included in computation.
For purposes of computing the limitation under this paragraph (d), the consolidated return years of the group include only those years, including the year to which a credit is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude—
(A) For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the credit is carried; and
(B) For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the credit arose.
(iii)
Subgroups and successors.
The SRLY subgroup principles under § 1.1502-21(c)(2) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). The predecessor and successor principles under § 1.1502-21(f) also apply for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(iv)
Overlap with section 383.
The principles under § 1.1502-21(g) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d). For example, an overlap of paragraph (d) of this section and the application of section 383 with respect to a credit carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 383 credit limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 383 event), with the result that the limitation of this paragraph (d) does not apply. See §§ 1.1502-21(g)(2)(ii)(A) and 1.383-1; see also § 1.1502-21(g)(4) (subgroup rules).
(3)
Effective date
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (d) generally applies to consolidated return years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after March 13, 1998.
(A)
Contribution years.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, a group does not take into account a consolidated taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, in determining a member's (or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation under this paragraph (d).
(B)
Special subgroup rule.
In the event that the principles of § 1.1502-21(g)(1) do not apply to a particular credit carryover in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (d) of this section to determine the limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect to which the SRLY register (the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's contribution to consolidated section 38(c) limitation reduced by the aggregate of the member's or subgroup's section 38 credits arising and absorbed in all consolidated return years) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return is on or before May 25, 2000, the principles of § 1.1502-21(c)(2) shall be applied without regard to the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group).”
(ii)
Overlap rule.
Paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section (relating to overlap with section 383) applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 383, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2085), applies and which results in a section 383 credit limitation shall constitute a section 383 event.
(4)
Optional effective date of January 1, 1997.
(i) For consolidated taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, in lieu of paragraphs (c) and (e)(3) of this section (relating to the general business credit), § 1.1502-4(f)(3) and (g)(3) (relating to the foreign tax credit), the next to last sentence of § 1.1502-9A(a)(2), § 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) (relating to overall foreign losses), and § 1.1502-55(h)(4)(iii) (relating to the alternative minimum tax credit), a consolidated group may apply the corresponding provisions as they appear in 1998-1 C.B. 655 through 661 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) (treating references in such corresponding provisions to §§ 1.1502-9(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) as references to §§ 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv)). Also, in the case of a consolidated return change of ownership that occurs on or after January 1, 1997, in a taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is on or before March 13, 1998, a consolidated group may choose not to apply paragraph (e) of this section and § 1.1502-4(g) to taxable years ending after December 31, 1996. A consolidated group making the choices described in the two preceding sentences generally must apply all such corresponding provisions (including not applying paragraph (e) of this section and § 1.1502-4(g)) for all relevant years. However, a consolidated group making the election provided in § 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(vi) (electing not to apply § 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) to years beginning before January 1, 1998) may nevertheless choose to apply all such corresponding provisions referred to in this paragraph (d)(4)(i) other than the provision corresponding to § 1.1502-9A(b)(1)(v) for all relevant years.
(ii) If a consolidated group chooses to apply the corresponding provisions referred to in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the consolidated group shall not take into account a consolidated taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997, in determining a member's (or subgroup's) contributions to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation under this paragraph (d).
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (d):

# Example.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and T. P is the common parent of the P group. P acquires all the stock of T at the beginning of Year 2. T carries over an unused section 38 general business credit from Year 1 of $100,000. The table in paragraph (i) of this Example shows the group's net consolidated income tax, consolidated tentative minimum tax, and consolidated net regular tax liabilities, and T's share of such taxes computed under the principles of section 1552 and the percentage method under § 1.1502-
33(d)(3), assuming a 100% allocation of any decreased tax liability, for Year 2. (The effects of the lower section 11 brackets are ignored, there are no other tax credits affecting a group amount or member's share, and $1,000s are omitted.)
ER25MY00.002
(ii) T's Year 1 is a SRLY with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). T did not undergo an ownership change giving rise to a section 383 credit limitation within 6 months of joining the P group. Thus, T's $100,000 general business credit arising in Year 1 is subject to a SRLY limitation in the P group. The amount of T's unused section 38 credits from Year 1 that are included in the consolidated section 38 credits for Year 2 may not
exceed T's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation. For Year 2, the group determines the consolidated section 38(c) limitation by reference to consolidated tentative minimum tax for Year 2. Therefore, T's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for Year 2 equals its share of consolidated net income tax minus its share of consolidated tentative minimum tax. T's contribution is $280,000 minus $160,000, or $120,000. However, because the group has a consolidated section 38 limitation of zero, it may not include any of T's unused section 38 credits in the consolidated section 38 credits for Year 2.
(iii) The following table shows similar information for the group for Year 3:
ER25MY00.003
(iv) The amount of T's unused section 38 credits from Year 1 that are included in the consolidated section 38 credits for Year 3 may not exceed T's aggregate contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for Years 2 and 3. For Year 3, the group determines the consolidated section 38(c) limitation by reference to the consolidated tentative minimum tax for Year 3. Therefore, T's contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for Year 3 equals its share of consolidated net income tax minus its share of consolidated tentative minimum tax. Applying the principles of section 1552 and § 1.1502-33(d) (taking into account, for example, that T's positive earnings and profits adjustment under § 1.1502-33(d) reflects its losses actually absorbed by the group), T's contribution is $(105,000) minus $(40,000), or $(65,000). T's aggregate contribution to the consolidated section 38(c) limitation for Years 2 and 3 is $120,000 + $(65,000), or $55,000. The group may include $55,000 of T's Year 1 unused section 38 credits in its consolidated section 38 tax credit in Year 3.
(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Early dispositions, etc., of section 38 property
—(1)
Dispositions of section 38 property during and after consolidated return year.
If property is subject to section 47(a) (1) or (2) with respect to a member during a consolidated return year, any increase in tax shall be added to the tax liability of the group under § 1.1502-2 (regardless of whether the property was placed in service in a consolidated or separate return year). Also, if property is subject to section 47(a) (1) or (2) with respect to a corporation during a taxable year for which such corporation files on a separate return basis, any increase in tax shall be added to the tax liability of such corporation (regardless of whether such property was placed in service in a consolidated or separate return year).
(2)
Exception for transfer to another member.
(i) Except as provided in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, a transfer of section 38 property from one member of the group to another member of such group during a consolidated return year shall not be treated as a disposition or cessation within the meaning of section 47(a)(1). If such section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property or becomes public utility property with respect to the transferee, before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing qualified investment, then section 47(a) (1) or (2) shall apply to the transferee with respect to such property (determined by taking into account the period of use, qualified investment, other dispositions, etc., of the transferor). Any increase in tax due to the application of section 47(a) (1) or (2) shall be added to the tax liability of such transferee (or the tax liability of a group, if the transferee joins in the filing of a consolidated return).
(ii) Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, if section 38 property is disposed of during a consolidated return year by one member of the group to another member of such group which is an organization to which section 593 applies or a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a), the tax under chapter 1 of the Code for such consolidated return year shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all prior taxable years which would result solely from treating such property, for purposes of determining qualified investment, as placed in service by such organization to which section 593 applies or such cooperative organization described in section 1381(a), as the case may be, but with due regard to the use of the property before such transfer.
(iii) Section 47(a)(1) shall apply to a transfer of section 38 property by a corporation during a consolidated return year if such corporation is liquidated in a transaction to which section 334(b)(2) applies.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P, S, and T file a consolidated return for calendar year 1967. In such year S places in service section 38 property having an estimated useful life of more than 8 years. In 1968, P, S, and T file a consolidated return and in such year S sells such property to T. Such sale will not cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that P, S, and T filed separate returns for 1967. The sale from S to T will not cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that P, S, and T continue to file consolidated returns through 1971 and in such year T disposes of the property to individual A. Section 47(a)(1) will apply to the group and any increase in tax shall be added
to the tax liability of the group. For the purposes of determining the actual period of use by T, such period shall include S's period of use.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that T files a separate return in 1971. Again, the actual periods of use by S and T will be combined in applying section 47. If the disposition results in an increase in tax under section 47(a)(1), such additional tax shall be added to the separate tax liability of T.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that in 1969, P sells all the stock of T to a third party. Such sale will not cause section 47(a)(1) to apply.
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 7246, 38 FR 758, Jan. 4, 1973; T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36679, July 18, 1995; T.D. 8751, 63 FR 1742, Jan. 12, 1998; T.D. 8766, 63 FR 12642, Mar. 16, 1998; T.D. 8884, 65 FR 33754, May 25, 2000; 65 FR 48379, Aug. 8, 2000; 65 FR 50281, Aug. 17, 2000; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106852, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-4
Consolidated foreign tax credit.
(a)
In general.
The foreign tax credit under section 901 is allowed to the group only if the agent for the group (as defined in § 1.1502-77(a)) chooses to use the credit in the computation of the consolidated tax liability of the group for the consolidated return year. If that choice is made, section 275(a)(4) provides that no deduction against taxable income may be taken on the consolidated return for foreign taxes paid or accrued by any member. However, if section 275(a)(4) does not apply, a deduction against consolidated taxable income may be allowed for certain taxes for which a credit is not allowed, even though the choice is made to claim a credit for other taxes. See, for example, sections 901(j)(3), 901(k)(7), 901(l)(4), 901(m)(6), and 908(b).
(b)
Computation of foreign tax credit.
The foreign tax credit for the consolidated return year is determined on a consolidated basis under the principles of sections 901 through 909 and 960. All foreign income taxes paid or accrued by members of the group for the year (including those deemed paid under section 960 and paragraph (d) of this section) must be aggregated.
(c)
Computation of limitation on credit.
For purposes of computing the group's limiting fraction under section 904, the following rules apply:
(1)
Computation of taxable income from foreign sources
—(i)
Separate categories.
The group must compute a separate foreign tax credit limitation for income in each separate category (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v)) for purposes of this section. The numerator of the limiting fraction in any separate category is the consolidated taxable income of the group determined in accordance with § 1.1502-11, taking into account adjustments required under section 904(b), if any, from sources without the United States in that category, determined in accordance with the rules of §§ 1.904-4 and 1.904-5 and the section 861 regulations (as defined in § 1.861-8(a)(1)).
(ii)
Adjustments under sections 904(f) and (g).
The rules for allocation and recapture of separate limitation losses and overall foreign losses under section 904(f) and § 1.1502-9 apply to determine the foreign source and U.S. source taxable income in each separate category of the consolidated group. Similarly, the rules for allocation and recapture of overall domestic losses under section 904(g) and § 1.1502-9 apply to determine the foreign source and U.S. source taxable income in each separate category of the consolidated group. See § 1.904(g)-3 for allocation rules under sections 904(f) and 904(g). The rules of sections 904(f) and 904(g) do not operate to recharacterize foreign income tax attributable to any separate category.
(iii)
Computation of consolidated net operating loss.
The source and separate category of the group's consolidated net operating loss (“CNOL”), as that term is defined in § 1.1502-21(e), for the taxable year, if any, is determined based on the amounts of any separate limitation losses and U.S. source loss that are not allocated to reduce U.S. source income or income in other separate categories under the rules of sections 904(f) and 904(g) in computing the group's consolidated foreign tax credit limitations for the taxable year under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(iv)
Characterization of CNOL carried to a separate return year
—(A)
In general.
The total amount of CNOL attributable to a member that is carried to a separate return year is determined under the rules of § 1.1502-21(b)(2). The source
and separate category of the portion of the CNOL that is attributable to a member is determined under this paragraph (c)(1)(iv).
(B)
Tentative apportionment.
For the portion of the CNOL that is attributable to the member described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the consolidated group determines a tentative allocation and apportionment to each statutory and residual grouping (as described in § 1.861-8(a)(4) with respect to section 904 as the operative section) under the principles of § 1.1502-9(c)(2)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) by treating the portion of the group's CNOL in each statutory and residual grouping as if it were a CSLL account, as that term is described in § 1.1502-9(b)(4). This determination is made as of the end of the taxable year of the consolidated group in which the CNOL arose or, if earlier and applicable, when the member leaves the consolidated group.
(C)
Adjustments.
(
1
) If the total tentative apportionment for all statutory and residual groupings exceeds the portion of the CNOL attributable to the member described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section (the “excess amount”), then the tentative apportionment in each grouping is reduced by an amount equal to the excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the tentative apportionment in that grouping, and the denominator of which is the total tentative apportionments in all groupings.
(
2
) If the total tentative apportionment for all statutory and residual groupings is less than the total CNOL attributable to the member described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) (the “deficiency”), then the tentative apportionment in each grouping is increased by an amount equal to the deficiency multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the CNOL in that grouping that was not tentatively apportioned, and the denominator of which is the total CNOL in all groupings that was not tentatively apportioned.
(v)
Consolidated net capital losses.
The principles of the rules in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section apply for purposes of determining the source and separate category of consolidated net capital losses described in § 1.1502-22(e).
(2)
Computation of consolidated taxable income.
The denominator of the limiting fraction in any separate category is the consolidated taxable income of the group determined in accordance with § 1.1502-11, taking into account adjustments required under section 904(b), if any.
(3)
Computation of tax against which credit is taken.
The tax against which the limiting fraction under section 904(a) is applied will be the consolidated tax liability of the group determined under § 1.1502-2, but without regard to § 1.1502-2(a)(2) through (4) and (8) and (9), and without regard to any credit against such liability. See sections 26(b) and 901(a).
(d)
Carryover and carryback of unused foreign tax
—(1)
Allowance of unused foreign tax as consolidated carryover or carryback.
The consolidated group's carryovers and carrybacks of unused foreign tax (as defined in § 1.904-2(c)(1)) to the taxable year is determined on a consolidated basis under the principles of section 904(c) and § 1.904-2 and is deemed to be paid or accrued to a foreign country or U.S. territory (as defined in § 1.1502-1(l)) for that year. The consolidated group's unused foreign tax carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year consist of any unused foreign tax of the consolidated group, plus any unused foreign tax of members for separate return years, which may be carried over or back to the taxable year under the principles of section 904(c) and § 1.904-2. The consolidated group's unused foreign tax carryovers and carrybacks do not include any unused foreign taxes apportioned to a corporation for a separate return year pursuant to § 1.1502-79(d). A consolidated group's unused foreign tax in each separate category is the excess of the foreign taxes paid, accrued or deemed paid under section 960 by the consolidated group over the limitation in the applicable separate category for the consolidated return year.
See
paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Absorption rules.
For purposes of determining the amount, if any, of an unused foreign tax which can be carried to a taxable year (whether a consolidated or separate return year), the amount of the unused foreign tax that
is absorbed in a prior consolidated return year under section 904(c) shall be determined by—
(i) Applying all unused foreign taxes which can be carried to a prior year in the order of the taxable years in which those unused foreign taxes arose, beginning with the taxable year that ends earliest; and
(ii) Applying all unused foreign taxes which can be carried to such prior year from taxable years ending on the same date on a pro rata basis.
(e)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this section:
(1)
Facts.
(i) Domestic corporation P is incorporated on January 1, Year 1. On that same day, P incorporates domestic corporations S and T as wholly owned subsidiaries. P, S, and T file consolidated returns for Years 1 and 2 on the basis of a calendar year. T engages in business solely through a qualified business unit in Country A. S engages in business solely through qualified business units in Countries A and B. P does business solely in the United States. During Year 1, T sold an item of inventory to P at a gain of $2,000. Under § 1.1502-13 the intercompany gain has not been taken into account as of the close of Year 1. The taxable income of each member for Year 1 from foreign and U.S. sources, and the foreign taxes paid on such foreign income, are as follows:

(ii) The separate taxable income of each member was computed by taking into account the rules under § 1.1502-12. Accordingly, T's intercompany gain of $2,000 is not included in T's taxable income for Year 1. The group's consolidated taxable income (computed in accordance with § 1.1502-11) is $80,000. The consolidated tax liability against which the credit may be taken (computed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section) is $16,800.
(2)
Analysis.
Under section 904(d) and paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the aggregate amount of foreign income taxes paid to all foreign countries with respect to the foreign branch category income of $21,000 ($12,000 + $9,000) that may be claimed as a credit in Year 1 is limited to $8,400 ($16,800 × $40,000/$80,000). Assuming P, as the agent for the group, chooses to use the foreign taxes paid as a credit, the group may claim a $8,400 foreign tax credit.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years for which the original consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after January 11, 2021.

§ 1.1502-5
Estimated tax.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Consolidated estimated tax.
If a group files a consolidated return for two consecutive taxable years, it must make payments of estimated tax on a consolidated basis for each subsequent taxable year until separate returns are filed. When filing on a consolidated basis, the group is generally treated as a single corporation for purposes of section 6655 (relating to payment of estimated tax by corporations). If separate returns are filed by the members for a taxable year, the amount of any estimated tax payments made with respect to a consolidated estimated tax for the year is credited against the separate tax liabilities of the members in any reasonable manner designated by the common parent.
(2)
First two consolidated return years.
For its first two consolidated return years, a group may make payments of estimated tax on either a consolidated or a separate member basis. The amount of any separate estimated tax payments is credited against the consolidated tax liability of the group.
(b)
Addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 6655
—(1)
Consolidated return filed.
For its first two consolidated return years, a group may compute the amount of the penalty (if any) under section 6655 on a consolidated basis or a separate member basis, regardless of the method of payment. Thereafter, the group must compute the penalty for any consolidated return year on a consolidated basis.
(2)
Computation of penalty on consolidated basis
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(2) provides rules for computing the penalty under section 6655 on a consolidated basis.
(ii)
Preceding taxable year.
The tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year referred to in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) is, if a consolidated return was filed for that preceding year, the tax shown on the consolidated return for that preceding year or, if a consolidated return was not filed for that preceding year, the aggregate of the taxes shown on the separate returns of the common parent and any other corporation that was a member of the same affiliated group as the common parent for that preceding year.
(iii)
Aggregate of payments made by all members.
If estimated tax was not paid on a consolidated basis, the amount of the group's payments of estimated tax for the taxable year is the aggregate of the payments made by all members for the year.
(iv)
Required annual payment rule.
If the common parent is otherwise eligible to use the section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) required annual payment rule, that rule applies only if the group's consolidated return, or each member's separate return if the group did not file a consolidated return, for the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months.
(3)
Computation of penalty on separate member basis.
To compute any penalty under section 6655 on a separate member basis, for purposes of section 6655(d)(1)(B)(i), the “tax shown on the return” for the taxable year is the portion of the tax shown on the consolidated return allocable to the member under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. If the member was included in the consolidated return filed by the group for the preceding taxable year, for purposes of section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii), the “tax shown on the return” for the preceding taxable year for any member is the portion of the tax shown on the consolidated return for the preceding year allocable to the member under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(4)
Consolidated payments if separate returns filed.
If the group does not file a consolidated return for the taxable year but makes payments of estimated tax on a consolidated basis, for purposes of section 6655(b)(1)(B), the “amount (if any) of the installment paid” by any member is an amount apportioned to the member in any reasonable manner designated by the common parent. If a member was included in the consolidated return filed by the group for the preceding taxable year, the amount of the member's penalty under section 6655 is computed on the separate member basis described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(5)
Tax defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
tax
means the excess of—
(i) The sum of—
(A) The consolidated tax imposed by section 11 or subchapter L of chapter 1, whichever applies;
(B) The tax imposed by section 55(a); plus
(C) The tax imposed by section 59A; over
(ii) The credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(6)
Allocation of consolidated tax liability for determining earnings and profits.
For purposes of this section, the tax shown on a consolidated return is allocated to the members of the group by allocating any tax described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, net of allowable credits under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, under the method that the group has elected pursuant to section 1552 and § 1.1502-33(d).
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples.
(1)
Example 1.
Corporations P and S1 file a consolidated return for the first time for calendar year 2021. P and S1 also file consolidated returns for calendar year 2022 and calendar year 2023. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for the 2021 and 2022 taxable years, P and S1 may pay estimated tax on either a separate or consolidated basis. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the 2023 taxable year, the group must pay its estimated tax on a consolidated basis. In determining whether P and S1 come within the exception provided in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) for 2023, the “tax shown on the return” is the tax shown on the consolidated return for the 2022 taxable year.
(2)
Example 2.
Corporations P, S1, and S2 file a consolidated return for the first time for calendar year 2021 and file their second consolidated return for calendar year 2022. S2 ceases to be a member of the group on September 15, 2023. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether the group (which no longer includes S2) comes within the exception provided in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) for 2023, the “tax shown on the return” is the tax shown on the consolidated return for calendar year 2022.
(3)
Example 3.
Corporations P and S1 file a consolidated return for the first time for calendar year 2021 and file their second consolidated return for calendar year 2022. Corporation S2 becomes a member of the group on July 1, 2023, and joins in the filing of the consolidated return for calendar year 2023. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether the group (which now includes S2) comes within the exception provided in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) for 2023, the “tax shown on the return” is the tax shown on the consolidated return for calendar year 2022. Any tax of S2 for any separate return year is not included as a part of the “tax shown on the return” for purposes of applying section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii).
(4)
Example 4.
Corporations X and Y file consolidated returns for the calendar years 2021 and 2022 and separate returns for calendar year 2023. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in determining whether X or Y comes within the exception provided in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) for 2023, the “tax shown on the return” is the amount of tax shown on the consolidated return for 2022 allocable to X and to Y in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

§ 1.1502-6
Liability for tax.
(a)
Several liability of members of group.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the common parent corporation and each subsidiary which was a member of the group during any part of the consolidated return year shall be severally liable for the tax for such year computed in accordance with the regulations under section 1502 prescribed on or before the due date (not including extensions of time) for the filing of the consolidated return for such year.
(b)
Liability of subsidiary after withdrawal.
If a subsidiary has ceased to be a member of the group and in such cessation resulted from a bona fide sale or exchange of its stock for fair value and occurred prior to the date upon which any deficiency is assessed, the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner believes that the assessment or collection of the balance of the deficiency will not be jeopardized, make assessment and collection of such deficiency from such former subsidiary in an amount not exceeding the portion of such deficiency which the Commissioner may determine to be allocable to it. If the Commissioner makes assessment and collection of any part of a deficiency from such former subsidiary, then for purposes of any credit or refund of the amount collected from such former
subsidiary the agency of the common parent under the provisions of § 1.1502-77 does not apply.
(c)
Effect of intercompany agreements.
No agreement entered into by one or more members of the group with any other member of such group or with any other person shall in any case have the effect of reducing the liability prescribed under this section.
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 9002, 67 FR 43540, June 28, 2002; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106853, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-9
Consolidated overall foreign losses, separate limitation losses, and overall domestic losses.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for applying section 904(f) and (g) (including its definitions and nomenclature) to a group and its members. Generally, section 904(f) concerns rules relating to overall foreign losses (OFLs) and separate limitation losses (SLLs) and the consequences of such losses. Under section 904(f)(5), losses are computed separately in each category of income described in section 904(d)(1) or § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v) (separate category). Section 904(g) concerns rules relating to overall domestic losses (ODLs) and the consequences of such losses. Paragraph (b) of this section defines terms and provides computational and accounting rules, including rules regarding recapture. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules that apply to OFLs, SLLs, and ODLs when a member becomes or ceases to be a member of a group. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a predecessor and successor rule. Paragraph (e) of this section provides effective dates.
(b)
Consolidated application of section 904(f) and (g).
A group applies section 904(f) and (g) for a consolidated return year in accordance with that section, subject to the following rules:
(1)
Computation of CSLI or CSLL and consolidated U.S.-source taxable income or CDL.
The group computes its consolidated separate limitation income (CSLI) or consolidated separate limitation loss (CSLL) for each separate category under the principles of § 1.1502-11 by aggregating each member's foreign-source taxable income or loss in such separate category computed under the principles of § 1.1502-12, and taking into account the foreign portion of the consolidated items described in § 1.1502-11(a)(2) through (a)(6) for such separate category. The group computes its consolidated U.S.-source taxable income or consolidated domestic loss (CDL) under similar principles.
(2)
Netting CSLLs, CSLIs, and consolidated U.S.-source taxable income.
The group applies section 904(f)(5) to determine the extent to which a CSLL for a separate category reduces CSLI for another separate category or consolidated U.S.-source taxable income.
(3)
Netting CDL and CSLI.
The group applies section 904(g)(2) to determine the extent to which a CDL reduces CSLI.
(4)
CSLL, COFL, and CODL accounts.
To the extent provided in section 904(f), the amount by which a CSLL for a separate category (the loss category) reduces CSLI for another separate category (the income category) will result in the creation of (or addition to) a CSLL account for the loss category with respect to the income category. Likewise, the amount by which a CSLL for a loss category reduces consolidated U.S.-source taxable income will create (or add to) a consolidated overall foreign loss account (a COFL account). To the extent provided in section 904(g), the amount by which a CDL reduces CSLI will result in the creation of (or addition to) a consolidated overall domestic loss (CODL) account for the income category reduced by the CDL.
(5)
Recapture of COFL, CSLL, and CODL accounts.
In the case of a COFL account for a loss category, section 904(f)(1) and section 904(f)(3) recharacterize some or all of the foreign-source income in the loss category as U.S.-source income. In the case of a CSLL account for a loss category with respect to an income category, section 904(f)(5)(C) and section 904(f)(5)(F) recharacterize some or all of the foreign-source income in the loss category as foreign-source income in the income category. In the case of a CODL account, section 904(g)(3) recharacterizes some of the U.S.-source income as foreign-source income in the separate category that was offset by the CDL. The COFL account, CSLL account, or CODL account is reduced to the extent
income is recharacterized with respect to such account.
(6)
Intercompany transactions
—(i)
Nonapplication of section 904(f) disposition rules.
Neither section 904(f)(3) (in the case of a COFL account) nor section 904(f)(5)(F) (in the case of a CSLL account) applies at the time of a disposition that is an intercompany transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies. Instead, section 904(f)(3) and section 904(f)(5)(F) apply only at such time and only to the extent that the group is required under § 1.1502-13 (without regard to section 904(f)(3) and section 904(f)(5)(F)) to take into account any intercompany items resulting from the disposition, based on the COFL or CSLL account existing at the end of the consolidated return year during which the group takes the intercompany items into account.
(ii)
Examples.
Paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following examples. The identity of the parties and the basic assumptions set forth in § 1.1502-13(c)(7)(i) apply to the examples. Except as otherwise stated, assume further that the consolidated group recognizes no foreign source income other than as a result of the transactions described. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) On June 10, year 1, S transfers nondepreciable property with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $250 to B in a transaction to which section 351 applies. The property was predominantly used without the United States in a trade or business within the meaning of section 904(f)(3). B continues to use the property without the United States. The group has a COFL account in the relevant loss category of $120 as of December 31, year 1.
(ii) Because the contribution from S to B is an intercompany transaction, section 904(f)(3) does not apply to result in any gain recognition in year 1. See paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
(iii) On January 10, year 4, B ceases to be a member of the group. Because S did not recognize gain in year 1 under section 351, no gain is taken into account in year 4 under § 1.1502-13. Thus, no portion of the group's COFL account is recaptured in year 4. For rules requiring apportionment of a portion of the COFL account to B, see paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of
Example 1.
On January 10, year 4, B sells the property to X for $300. As of December 31, year 4, the group's COFL account is $40. (The COFL account was reduced between year 1 and year 4 due to unrelated foreign-source income taken into account by the group.)
(ii) B takes into account gain of $200 in year 4. The $40 COFL account in year 4 recharacterizes $40 of the gain as U.S. source. See section 904(f)(3).

# Example 3.
(i) On June 10, year 1, S sells nondepreciable property with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $250 to B for $250 cash. The property was predominantly used without the United States in a trade or business within the meaning of section 904(f)(3). The group has a COFL account in the relevant loss category of $120 as of December 31, year 1. B predominantly uses the property in a trade or business without the United States.
(ii) Because the sale is an intercompany transaction, section 904(f)(3) does not require the group to take into account any gain in year 1. Thus, under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the COFL account is not reduced in year 1.
(iii) On January 10, year 4, B sells the property to X for $300. As of December 31, year 4, the group's COFL account is $60. (The COFL account was reduced between year 1 and year 4 due to unrelated foreign-source income taken into account by the group.)
(iv) In year 4, S's $150 intercompany gain and B's $50 corresponding gain are taken into account to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. See § 1.1502-13(c). All of B's $50 corresponding gain is recharacterized under section 904(f)(3). If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $100 basis in the property and would have $200 of gain ($60 of which would be recharacterized under section 904(f)(3)), instead of a $50 gain. Consequently, S's $150 intercompany gain and B's $50 corresponding gain are taken into account, and $10 of S's gain is recharacterized under section 904(f)(3) as U.S. source income to reflect the $10 difference between B's $50 recharacterized gain and the $60 recomputed gain that would have been recharacterized.
(c)
Becoming or ceasing to be a member of a group
—(1)
Adding separate accounts on becoming a member.
At the time that a corporation becomes a member of a group (a new member), the group adds to the balance of its COFL, CSLL or CODL account the balance of the new member's corresponding OFL account, SLL account or ODL account. A new member's OFL account corresponds to a COFL account if the account is for the same loss category. A new member's SLL account corresponds to a
CSLL account if the account is for the same loss category and with respect to the same income category. A new member's ODL account corresponds to a CODL account if the account is with respect to the same income category. If the group does not have a COFL, CSLL or CODL account corresponding to the new member's account, it creates a COFL, CSLL or CODL account with a balance equal to the balance of the member's account.
(2)
Apportionment of consolidated account to departing member
—(i)
In general.
A group apportions to a member that ceases to be a member (a departing member) a portion of each COFL, CSLL and CODL account as of the end of the year during which the member ceases to be a member and after the group makes the additions or reductions to such account required under paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (c)(1) of this section (other than an addition under paragraph (c)(1) of this section attributable to a member becoming a member after the departing member ceases to be a member). The group computes such portion under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, as limited by paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The departing member carries such portion to its first separate return year after it ceases to be a member. Also, the group reduces each account by such portion and carries such reduced amount to its first consolidated return year beginning after the year in which the member ceases to be a member. If two or more members cease to be members in the same year, the group computes the portion allocable to each such member (and reduces its accounts by such portion) in the order that the members cease to be members.
(ii)
Departing member's portion of group's account.
A departing member's portion of a group's COFL, CSLL or CODL account for a loss category is computed based upon the member's share of the group's assets that generate income subject to recapture at the time that the member ceases to be a member. Under the characterization principles of §§ 1.861-9T(g)(3), 1.861-12, and 1.861-13, the group identifies the assets of the departing member and the remaining members that generate U.S.-source income (domestic assets) and foreign-source income (foreign assets) in each separate category. The assets are characterized based upon the income that the assets are reasonably expected to generate after the member ceases to be a member. The member's portion of a group's COFL or CSLL account for a loss category is the group's COFL or CSLL account, respectively, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the member's foreign assets for the loss category and the denominator of which is the value of the foreign assets of the group (including the departing member) for the loss category. The member's portion of a group's CODL account for each income category is the group's CODL account multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the member's domestic assets and the denominator of which is the value of the domestic assets of the group (including the departing member). The value of the domestic and foreign assets is determined under the asset valuation rules of § 1.861-9(g)(1) and (2) using either tax book value or alternative tax book value under the method chosen by the group for purposes of interest apportionment as provided in § 1.861-9(g)(1)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iv) (assets in intercompany transactions) applies, but § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iii) (adjustments for directly allocated interest) does not apply. The member's portions of COFL, CSLL, and CODL accounts are limited by paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the tax book value of assets transferred in intercompany transactions is determined without regard to previously deferred gain or loss that is taken into account by the group as a result of the transaction in which the member ceases to be a member. The assets should be valued at the time the member ceases to be a member, but values on other dates may be used unless this creates substantial distortions. For example, if a member ceases to be a member in the middle of the group's consolidated return year, an average of the values of assets at the beginning and end of the year (as provided in § 1.861-9(g)(2)) may be used or, if a member ceases to be a member in
the early part of the group's consolidated return year, values at the beginning of the year may be used, unless this creates substantial distortions.
(iii)
Limitation on member's portion.
If the aggregate of a member's portions of COFL and CSLL accounts for a loss category (with respect to one or more income categories) determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section exceeds 150 percent of the actual fair market value of the member's foreign assets in the loss category, the member's portion of the COFL or CSLL accounts for the loss category is reduced (proportionately, in the case of multiple accounts) by such excess. In addition, if the aggregate of a member's portions of CODL accounts (with respect to one or more income categories) determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section exceeds 150 percent of the actual fair market value of the member's domestic assets, the member's portion of the CODL accounts is reduced (proportionately, in the case of multiple accounts) by such excess. This rule does not apply in the case of COFL or CSLL accounts if the departing member and all other members that cease to be members as part of the same transaction own all (or substantially all) the foreign assets in the loss category. In the case of CODL accounts, this rule does not apply if the departing member and all other members that cease to be members as part of the same transaction own all (or substantially all) the domestic assets.
(iv)
Determination of values of domestic and foreign assets binding on departing member.
The group's determination of the value of the member's and the group's domestic and foreign assets for a loss category is binding on the member, unless the Commissioner concludes that the determination is not appropriate. The common parent of the group must attach a statement to the return for the taxable year that the departing member ceases to be a member of the group that sets forth the name and taxpayer identification number of the departing member, the amount of each COFL and CSLL for each loss category and each CODL that is apportioned to the departing member under this paragraph (c)(2), the method used to determine the value of the member's and the group's domestic and foreign assets in each such loss category, and the value of the member's and the group's domestic and foreign assets in each such loss category. The common parent must also furnish a copy of the statement to the departing member.
(v)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a corporation becomes a member and ceases to be a member, and a principal purpose of the corporation becoming and ceasing to be a member is to transfer the corporation's OFL account, SLL account or ODL account to the group or to transfer the group's COFL, CSLL or CODL account to the corporation, appropriate adjustments will be made to eliminate the benefit of such a transfer of accounts. Similarly, if any member acquires assets or disposes of assets (including a transfer of assets between members of the group and the departing member) with a principal purpose of affecting the apportionment of accounts under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, appropriate adjustments will be made to eliminate the benefit of such acquisition or disposition.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
(i) On November 6, year 1, S, a member of the P group, a consolidated group with a calendar consolidated return year, ceases to be a member of the group. On December 31, year 1, the P group has a $40 COFL account for the general category, a $20 CSLL account for the general category (that is, the loss category) with respect to the passive category (that is, the income category), and a $10 CODL account with respect to the passive category (that is, the income category). No member of the group has foreign-source income or loss in year 1. The group apportions its interest expense according to the tax book value method.
(ii) On November 6, year 1, the group identifies S's assets and the group's assets (including S's assets) expected to produce foreign-source general category income. Use of end-of-the-year values will not create substantial distortions in determining the relative values of S's and the group's relevant assets on November 6, year 1. The group determines that S's relevant assets have a tax book value of $2,000 and a fair market value of $2,200. Also, the group's relevant assets (including S's assets) have a tax book value of $8,000. On November 6, year 1, S has no assets expected to produce U.S. source income.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, S takes a $10 COFL account for the general category ($40 × $2,000/$8,000) and a $5 CSLL account for the general category with respect to the passive category ($20 × $2,000/$8,000). S does not take any portion of the CODL account. The limitation described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section does not apply because the aggregate of the COFL and CSLL accounts for the general category that are apportioned to S ($15) is less than 150% of the actual fair market value of S's general category foreign assets ($2,200 × 150%).

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the fair market value of S's general category foreign assets is $4 as of November 6, year 1.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, S's COFL and CSLL accounts for the general category must be reduced by $9, which is the excess of $15 (the aggregate amount of the accounts apportioned under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) over $6 (150% of the $4 actual fair market value of S's general category foreign assets). S thus takes a $4 COFL account for the general category ($10 − ($9 × $10/$15)) and a $2 CSLL account for the general category with respect to the passive category ($5 − ($9 × $5/$15)).

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that S also has assets that are expected to produce U.S. source income.
(ii) On November 6, year 1, the group identifies S's assets and the group's assets (including S's assets) expected to produce U.S. source income. Use of end-of-the-year values will not create substantial distortions in determining the relative values of S's and the group's relevant assets on November 6, year 1. The group determines that S's relevant assets have a tax book value of $3,000 and a fair market value of $2,500. Also, the group's relevant assets (including S's assets) have a tax book value of $6,000.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, S takes a $5 CODL account ($10 × $3,000/$6,000), in addition to the COFL and CSLL accounts determined in
Example 1.
The limitation described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section does not apply because the CODL account that is apportioned to S ($5) is less than 150% of the actual fair market value of S's U.S. assets ($2,500 × 150%).

# Computation of Consolidated Taxable Income
§ 1.1502-11
Consolidated taxable income.
(a)
In general.
The consolidated taxable income (CTI) for a consolidated return year is determined by taking into account:
(1) The separate taxable income of each member of the group (
see
§ 1.1502-12 for the computation of separate taxable income);
(2) Any consolidated net operating loss (CNOL) deduction (
see
§ 1.1502-21 for the computation of the CNOL deduction);
(3) Any consolidated capital gain net income (
see
§ 1.1502-22 for the computation of consolidated capital gain net income);
(4) Any consolidated section 1231 net loss (
see
§ 1.1502-23 for the computation of consolidated section 1231 net loss);
(5) Any consolidated charitable contributions deduction (
see
§ 1.1502-24 for the computation of the consolidated charitable contributions deduction); and
(6) Any consolidated dividends received deduction (
see
§ 1.1502-26 for the computation of the consolidated dividends received deduction).
(b)
Elimination of circular stock basis adjustments when there is no excluded COD income
—(1)
In general.
If one member (P) disposes of the stock of another member (S), this paragraph (b) limits the use of S's deductions and losses in the year of disposition and the carryback of items to prior years. The purpose of the limitation is to prevent P's income or gain from the disposition of S's stock from increasing the absorption of S's deductions and losses, because the increased absorption would
reduce P's basis (or increase its excess loss account) in S's stock under § 1.1502-32 and, in turn, increase P's income or gain. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the application of these principles to P's deduction or loss from the disposition of S's stock, and paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the application of these principles to multiple stock dispositions. This paragraph (b) applies only when no member realizes discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) (excluded COD income) during the taxable year of the disposition. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules that apply when a member realizes excluded COD income during the taxable year of the disposition. See § 1.1502-19(c) for the definition of disposition.
(2)
Limitation on deductions and losses
—(i)
Determination of amount of limitation.
If P disposes of one or more shares of S's stock, the extent to which S's deductions and losses for the tax year of the disposition (and its deductions and losses carried over from prior years) may offset income and gain is subject to limitation. The amount of S's deductions and losses that may offset income and gain is determined by tentatively computing taxable income (or loss) for the year of disposition (and any prior years to which the deductions or losses may be carried) without taking into account P's income and gain from the disposition.
(ii)
Application of limitation.
S's deductions and losses offset income and gain only to the extent of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. To the extent S's deductions and losses in the year of disposition cannot offset income or gain because of the limitation under this paragraph (b), the items are carried to other years under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations as if they were the only items incurred by S in the year of disposition. For example, to the extent S incurs an operating loss in the year of disposition that is limited, the loss is treated as a separate net operating loss attributable to S arising in that year. The tentative computation does not affect the manner in which S's unlimited deductions and losses are absorbed or the manner in which deductions and losses of other members are absorbed. (If the amount of S's unlimited deductions and losses actually absorbed is less than the amount absorbed in the tentative computation, P's stock basis adjustments under § 1.1502-32 reflect only the amounts actually absorbed.)
(iii)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b), unless otherwise stated, P owns all of the only class of S's stock for the entire year, S owns no stock of lower-tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the following examples.
(A)
Example 1
.
Limitation on losses with respect to stock gain.
—
(
1
) P has a $500 basis in S's stock. For Year 1, P has ordinary income of $30 (determined without taking P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock into account) and S has an $80 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $520 at the close of Year 1.
(
2
) To determine the amount of the limitation on S's loss under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and the effect under § 1.1502-32(b) of the absorption of S's loss on P's basis in S's stock, P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus S's $80 loss). Thus, $50 of S's loss is limited under this paragraph (b).
(
3
) Because $30 of S's loss is absorbed in the determination of consolidated taxable income under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, P's basis in S's stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32(b) from $500 to $470 immediately before the disposition. Consequently, P recognizes a $50 gain from the sale of S's stock and the group has consolidated taxable income of $50 for Year 1 (P's $30 of ordinary income and $50 gain from the sale of S's stock, less the $30 of S's loss). In addition, S's limited loss of $50 is treated as a separate net operating loss attributable to S and, because S
ceases to be a member, the loss is apportioned to S under § 1.1502-21 and carried to its first separate return year.
(B)
Example 2.
Carrybacks and carryovers.
—
(
1
) For Year 1, the P group has consolidated taxable income of $30, and a consolidated net capital loss of $100 ($50 attributable to P and $50 to S). At the beginning of Year 2, P has a $300 basis in S's stock. For Year 2, P has ordinary income of $30, and a $20 capital gain (determined without taking the $100 consolidated net capital loss carryover or P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock into account), and S has a $100 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $280 at the close of Year 2.
(
2
) To determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section on S's losses, and the effect of the absorption of S's losses on P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken into account. For Year 2, the P group is tentatively treated as having a $70 consolidated net operating loss (S's $100 ordinary loss, less P's $30 of ordinary income). The P group is also treated as having no consolidated net capital gain in Year 2, because P's $20 capital gain is reduced by $20 of the consolidated net capital loss carryover from Year 1 under section 1212(a) (the absorption of which is attributed equally to P and S). In addition, of the $70 consolidated net operating loss, $30 is carried back to Year 1 and offsets P's ordinary income in that year, and $40 is carried forward. Consequently, $40 of S's operating loss from Year 2, and $40 of the consolidated net capital loss carryover from Year 1 attributable to S, are limited under this paragraph (b).
(
3
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the limitation under this paragraph (b) does not affect the absorption of any deductions and losses attributable to P, $60 of S's operating loss from Year 2, and $10 of the consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 attributable to S. Consequently, P's basis in S's stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32(b) by $70, from $300 to $230, and P recognizes a $50 gain from the sale of S's stock in Year 2. Thus, the P group is treated as having a $20 unlimited net operating loss that is carried back to Year 1:
Ordinary income:
P
$30
S (excluding the $40 limited loss)
(60)
Sub Total
$(30)
Consolidated net capital gain:
P ($20 + $50 from S stock − $50 from Year 1)
$20
S (−$10 from Year 1)
(10)
Sub Total
$10
Consolidated taxable income
$(20)
(
4
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's $40 ordinary loss from Year 2 that is limited under this paragraph (b) is treated as a separate net operating loss arising in Year 2. Similarly, $40 of the consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 attributable to S is treated as a separate net capital loss carried over from Year 1. Because S ceases to be a member, the $40 net operating loss from Year 2 and the $40 consolidated net capital loss from Year 1 are allocated to S under §§ 1.1502-21 and 1.1502-22, respectively and are carried to S's first separate return year.
(C)
Example 3.
Allocation of basis adjustments.
—
(
1
) For Year 1, the P group has consolidated taxable income of $100. At the beginning of Year 2, P has a $40 basis in each of the 10 shares of S's stock. For Year 2, P has an $80 ordinary loss (determined without taking into account P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock) and S has an $80 ordinary loss. P sells 2 shares of S's stock for $85 each at the close of Year 2.
(
2
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of the limitation on S's loss is determined by tentatively treating the P group as having a $160 consolidated net operating loss for Year 2. Of this amount, $100 is carried back under section 172 and absorbed in Year 1 ($50 attributable to S and $50 attributable to P). Consequently, $30 of S's loss is limited under this paragraph (b).
(
3
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the limitation under this paragraph (b) does not affect the absorption of P's $80 ordinary loss or $50 of S's ordinary loss. Consequently, P's basis in each share of S's stock is reduced from $40 to $35 under § 1.1502-32(b), and P recognizes a $100 gain from the sale of the
2 shares. Thus, the P group is treated as having a $30 unlimited net operating loss:
Ordinary loss:
P
$(80)
S (excluding the $30 limited loss)
(50)
Sub Total
$(130)
Consolidated net capital gain:
P
$100
S
0
Sub Total
$100
Unlimited consolidated net operating loss
$(30)
(
4
) A portion of the $130 of unlimited operating losses for Year 2 is fully absorbed in that year, and a portion is carried back to Year 1. Thus, $61.50 of P's $80 loss ($100 multiplied by $80/$130) and $38.50 of S's $50 unlimited loss ($100 multiplied by $50/$130) are absorbed in Year 2. P's remaining $18.50 of loss and S's remaining $11.50 of loss are not subject to limitation and are carried back and absorbed in Year 1.
(
5
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's $30 of loss limited under this paragraph (b) is treated as a separate net operating loss.
(3)
Loss dispositions
—(i)
General rule.
The principles of paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if P recognizes a deduction or loss from the disposition of S's stock.
(ii)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (b)(3) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(a) P has a $400 basis in S's stock. For Year 1, P has a capital gain of $100 (determined without taking P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock into account) and S has both a $60 capital loss and a $200 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $140 at the close of Year 1.
(b) Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the amount of S's ordinary and capital losses that may offset income and gain is determined by tentatively computing the group's consolidated net operating loss and consolidated net capital loss without taking into account P's loss from the disposition of S's stock. The limitation is necessary to prevent P's loss from the disposition of S's stock from affecting the absorption of S's losses and thereby the adjustments to P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32(b) (which would, in turn, affect P's loss).
(c) Under the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of the limitation on S's loss is determined by tentatively treating the P group as having a $40 consolidated net capital gain and a $200 ordinary loss, which results in a $160 consolidated net operating loss for Year 1, all of which is attributable to S. Thus, $160 of S's ordinary loss is limited under this paragraph (b).
See also
§§ 1.337(d)-2, 1.1502-35, and 1.1502-36 for rules relating to basis adjustments and allowance of stock loss on dispositions of stock of a subsidiary member.
(4)
Multiple dispositions
—(i)
Stock of a member.
To the extent income, gain, deduction, or loss from a prior disposition of S's stock is deferred under any rule of law, the limitation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is determined by treating the year the deferred amount is taken into account as the year of the disposition.
(ii)
Stock of different members.
If S is a higher-tier corporation with respect to another member (T), and all of T's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss (including the absorption of T's deduction or loss) would be fully reflected in P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32, the limitation under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with respect to T's deductions and losses is determined without taking into account any income, gain, deduction, or loss from the disposition of the stock of S or T (or of the stock of members owned in the chain connecting S and T). However, this paragraph (b) does not otherwise limit the absorption of one member's deduction or loss with respect to the disposition of another member's stock.
(iii)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (b)(4) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Chain of subsidiaries.
(a) P owns all of S's stock with a $500 basis, and S owns all of T's stock with a $500 basis. For Year 1, P has ordinary income of $30, S has no income or loss, and T has an $80 ordinary loss. P sells S's stock for $520 at the close of Year 1.
(b) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph (b) of this section on T's loss, and the effect of the absorption of T's loss on P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus T's $80 loss). Because only $30 of T's loss offsets income or gain, P's basis in S's stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32(b) from
$500 to $470 immediately before the disposition of S's stock. Thus, P takes into account a $50 gain from the sale of S's stock.
(c) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that S has a $10 excess loss account in T's stock (rather than a $500 basis). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, neither P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock nor S's gain or loss from the disposition of T's stock (under § 1.1502-19) are taken into account for purposes of the tentative computations and the effect of any absorption under § 1.1502-32(b) on P's basis in S's stock and S's excess loss account in T's stock. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus T's $80 loss), and only $30 of T's loss may offset the group's income or gain. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $30 of T's loss increases S's excess loss account in T's stock to $40 and, under § 1.1502-19, the excess loss account is taken into account. Moreover, under § 1.1502-32(b), P's basis in S's stock is increased immediately before the sale by $10 (S's $40 gain under § 1.1502-19(b) minus T's $30 loss absorbed and tiered up under § 1.1502-32(b)), from $500 to $510. Thus, P takes into account a $10 gain from the sale of S's stock, and S takes into account a $40 gain from its excess loss account in T's stock.

# Example 2. Brother-sister subsidiaries.
(a) P owns all of the stock of S1 and S2, each with a $50 basis. For Year 1, the group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss ($50 of which is attributable to S1, and $50 to S2) determined without taking gain or loss from the disposition of member stock into account. At the close of Year 1, P sells the stock of S1 and S2 for $100 each.
(b) Paragraph (b)(4) of this section does not limit the loss of S1 or S2 with respect to the disposition of stock of the other. Consequently, each subsidiary's loss may offset P's gain from the disposition of the stock of the other subsidiary. Because this absorption results in a $50 reduction in P's basis in the stock of each subsidiary under § 1.1502-32(b), P's aggregate gain from the stock dispositions is increased from $100 to $200, $100 of which is offset by the losses of the subsidiaries.
(5)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b) applies to stock dispositions occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. For prior years, see § 1.1502-11(b) as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.
(c)
Elimination of circular stock basis adjustments when there is excluded COD income
—(1)
In general.
If one member (P) disposes of the stock of another member (S) in a year during which any member realizes excluded COD income, this paragraph (c) limits the use of S's deductions and losses in the year of disposition and the carryback of items to prior years, the amount of the attributes of certain members that can be reduced in respect of excluded COD income of certain other members, and the attributes that can be used to offset an excess loss account taken into account by reason of the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B). In addition to the purpose set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the purpose of these limitations is to prevent the reduction of tax attributes in respect of excluded COD income from affecting P's income, gain, or loss on the disposition of S stock (including a disposition of S stock that results from the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B)) and, in turn, affecting the attributes available for reduction pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28. See § 1.1502-19(c) for the definition of disposition.
(2)
Computation of tax liability, reduction of attributes, and computation of limits on absorption and reduction of attributes.
If a member realizes excluded COD income in the taxable year during which P disposes of S stock, the steps used to compute tax liability, to effect the reduction of attributes, and to compute the limitations on the absorption and reduction of attributes are as follows. These steps also apply to determine whether and to what extent an excess loss account must be taken into account as a result of the application of § 1.1502-19(b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii)(B).
(i)
Limitation on deductions and losses to offset income or gain.
First, the determination of the extent to which S's deductions and losses for the tax year of the disposition (and its deductions and losses carried over from prior years) may offset income and gain is made pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.
(ii)
Tentative adjustment of stock basis.
Second, § 1.1502-32 is tentatively applied to adjust the basis of the S stock to reflect the amount of S's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of taxable income or loss for the year of the disposition (and any prior years) that is made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of
this section, but not to reflect the realization of excluded COD income and the reduction of attributes in respect thereof.
(iii)
Tentative computation of stock gain or loss.
Third, in the case of a disposition of S stock that does not result from the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B), P's income, gain, or loss from the disposition of S stock is computed. For this purpose, the result of the computation pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is treated as the basis of such stock.
(iv)
Tentative computation of tax imposed.
Fourth, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the year of disposition (and any prior years) is tentatively computed. For this purpose, in the case of a disposition of S stock that does not result from the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B), the tentative computation of tax imposed takes into account P's income, gain, or loss from the disposition of S stock computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The tentative computation of tax imposed is made without regard to whether all or a portion of an excess loss account in a share of S stock is required to be taken into account pursuant to § 1.1502-19(b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii)(B).
(v)
Tentative reduction of attributes.
Fifth, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are tentatively applied to reduce the attributes remaining after the tentative computation of tax imposed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(vi)
Actual adjustment of stock basis.
Sixth, § 1.1502-32 is applied to reflect the amount of S's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of tax imposed for the year of the disposition (and any prior years) made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, and the excluded COD income applied to reduce attributes and the attributes tentatively reduced in respect of the excluded COD income pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.
(vii)
Actual computation of stock gain or loss.
Seventh, the group's actual gain or loss on the disposition of S stock (including a disposition that results from the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B)) is computed. The result of the computation pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section is treated as the basis of such stock.
(viii)
Actual computation of tax imposed.
Eighth, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the year of the disposition (and any prior years) is computed. The actual tax imposed on the group for the year of the disposition is computed by applying the limitation computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and by including the gain or loss recognized on the disposition of S stock computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section. However, attributes that were tentatively used in the computation of tax imposed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section and attributes that were tentatively reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section cannot offset any excess loss account taken into account as a result of the application of § 1.1502-19(b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii)(B).
(ix)
Actual reduction of attributes.
Ninth, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are actually applied to reduce the attributes remaining after the actual computation of tax imposed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section.
(A)
S or a lower-tier corporation realizes excluded COD income.
If S or a lower-tier corporation of S realizes excluded COD income, the aggregate amount of excluded COD income that is applied to reduce attributes attributable to members other than S and any lower-tier corporation of S pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2)(ix) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of excluded COD income that was tentatively applied to reduce attributes attributable to members other than S and any lower-tier corporation of S pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The amount of the actual reduction of attributes attributable to S and any lower-tier corporation of S that may be reduced in respect of the excluded COD income of S or a lower-tier corporation of S shall not be so limited.
(B)
A member other than S or a lower-tier corporation realizes excluded COD income.
If a member other than S or a lower-tier corporation of S realizes excluded COD income, the aggregate
amount of excluded COD income that is applied to reduce attributes (other than credits) attributable to S and any lower-tier corporation of S pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2)(ix) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of excluded COD income that was tentatively applied to reduce attributes (other than credits) attributable to S and any lower-tier corporation of S pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The amount of the actual reduction of attributes attributable to any member other than S and any lower-tier corporation of S that may be reduced in respect of the excluded COD income of S or a lower-tier corporation of S shall not be so limited.
(3)
Special rules.
(i) If the reduction of attributes attributable to a member is prevented as a result of a limitation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(B) of this section, the excluded COD income that would have otherwise been applied to reduce such attributes is applied to reduce the remaining attributes of the same type that are available for reduction under § 1.1502-28(a)(4), on a pro rata basis, prior to reducing attributes of a different type. The reduction of such remaining attributes, however, is subject to any applicable limitation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(B) of this section.
(ii) To the extent S's deductions and losses in the year of disposition (or those of a lower-tier corporation of S) cannot offset income or gain because of the limitation under paragraph (b) of this section or this paragraph (c) and are not reduced pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28, such items are carried to other years under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations as if they were the only items incurred by S (or a lower-tier corporation of S) in the year of disposition. For example, to the extent S incurs an operating loss in the year of disposition that is limited and is not reduced pursuant to section 108 and § 1.1502-28, the loss is treated as a separate net operating loss attributable to S arising in that year.
(4)
Definition of lower-tier corporation.
A corporation is a lower-tier corporation of S if all of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss (including the absorption of deduction or loss and the reduction of attributes other than credits) would be fully reflected in P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32.

For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c), unless otherwise stated, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, tax liabilities are disregarded, and no election under section 108(b)(5) is made. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Departing member realizes excluded COD income.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of S's stock with a $90 basis. For Year 1, P has ordinary income of $30, and S has an $80 ordinary loss and $100 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. P sells the S stock for $20 at the close of Year 1. As of the beginning of Year 2, S has Asset A with a basis of $0 and a fair market value of $20.
(ii)
Analysis.
The steps used to compute the tax imposed on the group, to effect the reduction of attributes, and to compute the limitations on the use and reduction of attributes are as follows:
(A)
Computation of limitation on deductions and losses to offset income or gain.
To determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section on S's loss and the effect of the absorption of S's loss on P's basis in S's stock under § 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the disposition of S's stock is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $50 (P's $30 of income minus S's $80 loss). Thus, $30 of S's loss is unlimited and $50 of S's loss is limited under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), all of the consolidated net operating loss is attributable to S.
(B)
Tentative adjustment of stock basis.
Then, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is tentatively applied to adjust the basis of S stock. For this purpose, however, adjustments attributable to the excluded COD income and the reduction of attributes in respect thereof are not taken into account. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $30 of S's loss decreases P's basis in S's stock by $30 to $60.
(C)
Tentative computation of stock gain or loss.
Then, P's income, gain, or loss from the sale of S stock is computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section using the basis computed in the previous step. Thus, P is treated as recognizing a $40 loss from the sale of S stock.
(D)
Tentative computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the tax imposed for the year of disposition is then tentatively computed, taking into account P's $40 loss on the sale of the S stock computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The group has a $50 consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 that, under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), is wholly attributable to S and a consolidated capital loss of $40 that, under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), is wholly attributable to P.
(E)
Tentative reduction of attributes.
Next, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are tentatively applied to reduce attributes remaining after the tentative computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S would first be reduced to take into account its $100 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 would be reduced by $50, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $0. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), S's remaining $50 of excluded COD income would reduce the consolidated capital loss attributable to P of $40 by $40 to $0. The remaining $10 of excluded COD income would have no effect.
(F)
Actual adjustment of stock basis.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is applied to reflect the amount of S's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of the tax imposed for the year of the disposition and the excluded COD income tentatively applied to reduce attributes and the attributes reduced in respect of the excluded COD income pursuant to the previous step. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $30 of S's loss, the application of $90 of S's excluded COD income to reduce attributes of P and S, and the reduction of the $50 loss attributable to S in respect of the excluded COD income results in a positive adjustment of $10 to P's basis in the S stock. P's basis in the S stock, therefore, is $100.
(G)
Actual computation of stock gain or loss.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, P's actual gain or loss on the sale of the S stock is computed using the basis computed in the previous step. Accordingly, P recognizes an $80 loss on the disposition of the S stock.
(H)
Actual computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the tax imposed is computed by taking into account P's $80 loss from the sale of S stock. Before the application of § 1.1502-28, therefore, the group has a consolidated net operating loss of $50 that is wholly attributable to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), and a consolidated capital loss of $80 that is wholly attributable to P under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(I)
Actual reduction of attributes.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section, sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are then actually applied to reduce attributes remaining after the actual computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S must first be reduced to take into account its $100 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $0. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), S's remaining $50 of excluded COD income reduces consolidated tax attributes. In particular, without regard to the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(A) of this section, the $80 consolidated capital loss, which under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) is attributable to P, would be reduced by $50 from $80 to $30. However, the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(A) of this section prevents the reduction of the consolidated capital loss attributable to P by more than $40. Therefore, the consolidated capital loss attributable to P is reduced by only $40 in respect of S's excluded COD income. The remaining $10 of excluded COD income has no effect.

# Example 2. Member other than departing member realizes excluded COD income.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of S1's and S2's stock. P's basis in S2's stock is $600. For Year 1, P has ordinary income of $30, S1 has a $100 ordinary loss and $100 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness, and S2 has $200 of ordinary loss. P sells the S2 stock for $600 at the close of Year 1. As of the beginning of Year 2, S1 has Asset A with a basis of $0 and a fair market value of $10.
(ii)
Analysis.
The steps used to compute the tax imposed on the group, to effect the reduction of attributes, and to compute the limitations on the use and reduction of attributes are as follows:
(A)
Computation of limitation on deductions and losses to offset income or gain.
To determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section on S2's loss and the effect of the absorption of S2's loss on P's basis in S2's stock under § 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the sale of S2's stock is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $270 (P's $30 of income minus S1's $100 loss and S2's $200 loss). Consequently, $20 of S2's loss from Year 1 is unlimited and $180 of S2's loss from Year 1 is limited under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), $90 of the consolidated net operating loss is attributable to S1 and $180 of the consolidated net operating loss is attributable to S2.
(B)
Tentative adjustment of stock basis.
Then, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is tentatively applied to adjust the basis of S2's stock. For this purpose, however, adjustments to the basis of S2's stock attributable to the reduction of attributes in respect of S1's excluded COD income are not taken into account. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $20 of S2's loss decreases P's basis in S2's stock by $20 to $580.
(C)
Tentative computation of stock gain or loss.
Then, P's income, gain, or loss from the disposition of S2 stock is computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section using the basis computed in the previous step. Thus, P is treated as recognizing a $20 gain from the sale of the S2 stock.
(D)
Tentative computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the tax imposed for the year of disposition is then tentatively computed, taking into account P's $20 gain from the sale of S2 stock computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Although S2's limited loss cannot be used to offset P's $20 gain from the sale of S2's stock under the rules of this section, S1's loss will offset that gain. Therefore, the group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $250, $70 of which is attributable to S1 and $180 of which is attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(E)
Tentative reduction of attributes.
Next, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are tentatively applied to reduce attributes remaining after the tentative computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S1 would first be reduced to take into account its $100 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 would be reduced by $70, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $0. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), S1's remaining $30 of excluded COD income would reduce the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 attributable to S2 of $180 by $30 to $150.
(F)
Actual adjustment of stock basis.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is applied to reflect the amount of S2's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of the tax imposed for the year of the disposition and the excluded COD income tentatively applied to reduce attributes and the attributes reduced in respect of the excluded COD income pursuant to the previous step. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of $20 of S2's loss to offset a portion of P's income and the application of $30 of S1's excluded COD income to reduce attributes attributable to S2 results in a negative adjustment of $50 to P's basis in the S2 stock. P's basis in the S2 stock, therefore, is $550.
(G)
Actual computation of stock gain or loss.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, P's actual gain or loss on the sale of the S2 stock is computed using the basis computed in the previous step. Therefore, P recognizes a $50 gain on the disposition of the S2 stock.
(H)
Actual computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the tax imposed is computed by taking into account P's $50 gain from the disposition of the S2 stock. Before the application of § 1.1502-28, therefore, the group has a consolidated net operating loss of $220, $40 of which is attributable to S1 and $180 of which is attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(I)
Actual reduction of attributes.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section, sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are then actually applied to reduce attributes remaining after the actual computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its $100 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $0. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), without regard to the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(B) of this section, S1's remaining $60 of excluded COD income would reduce S2's net operating loss of $180 to $120. However, the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(B) of this section prevents the reduction of S2's loss by more than $30. Therefore, S2's loss of $180 is reduced by $30 to $150 in respect of S1's excluded COD income. The remaining $30 of excluded COD income has no effect.

# Example 3. Lower-tier corporation of departing member realizes excluded COD income.
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of S1's stock, S2's stock, and S3's stock. S1 owns all of S4's stock. P's basis in S1's stock is $50 and S1's basis in S4's stock is $50. For Year 1, P has $50 of ordinary loss, S1 has $100 of ordinary loss, S2 has $150 of ordinary loss, S3 has $50 of ordinary loss, and S4 has $50 of ordinary loss and $80 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. P sells the S1 stock for $100 at the close of Year 1. As of the beginning of Year 2, S4 has Asset A with a fair market value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 1 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28, Asset A has a basis of $0.
(ii)
Analysis.
The steps used to compute the tax imposed on the group, to effect the reduction of attributes, and to compute the limitations on the use and reduction of attributes are as follows:
(A)
Computation of limitation on deductions and losses to offset income or gain.
To determine the amount of the limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section on S1's and S4's losses and the effect of the absorption of S1's and S4's losses on P's basis in S1's stock under § 1.1502-32(b), P's gain or loss from the sale of S1's stock is not taken into account. The group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $400. Consequently, $100 of S1's loss and $50 of S4's loss is limited under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(B)
Tentative adjustment of stock basis.
Then, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is tentatively applied to adjust the basis of S1's stock. For this purpose, adjustments to the basis of S1's stock attributable to S4's realization of excluded COD income and the reduction of attributes in respect of such excluded COD income are not taken into account. There is no adjustment under § 1.1502-32 to the basis of the S1 stock. Therefore, P's basis in the S1 stock for this purpose is $50.
(C)
Tentative computation of stock gain or loss.
Then, P's income, gain, or loss from the sale of S1 stock is computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section using the basis computed in the previous step. Thus, P is treated as recognizing a $50 gain from the sale of the S1 stock.
(D)
Tentative computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the tax imposed for the year of disposition is then tentatively computed, taking into account P's $50 gain from the sale of the S1 stock computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Although S1's and S4's limited losses cannot be used to offset P's $50 gain from the sale of S1's stock under the rules of this section, $10 of P's loss, $30 of S2's loss, and $10 of S3's loss will offset that gain. Therefore, the group is tentatively treated as having a consolidated net operating loss of $350, $40 of which is attributable to P, $100 of which is attributable to S1, $120 of which is attributable to S2, $40 of which is attributable to S3, and $50 of which is attributable to S4 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(E)
Tentative reduction of attributes.
Next, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are tentatively applied to reduce attributes remaining after the tentative computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S4 would first be reduced to take into account its $80 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 would be reduced by $50, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S4 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $300. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), S4's remaining $30 of excluded COD income would reduce the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 that is attributable to other members. Therefore, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 would be reduced by $30. Of that amount, $4 is attributable to P, $10 is attributable to S1, $12 is attributable to S2, and $4 is attributable to S3.
(F)
Actual adjustment of stock basis.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is applied to reflect the amount of S1's and S4's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of tax imposed for the year of the disposition and the excluded COD income tentatively applied to reduce attributes and the attributes reduced in respect of the excluded COD income pursuant to the previous step. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the application of $80 of S4's excluded COD income to reduce attributes, and the reduction of S4's loss in the amount of $50 and S1's loss in the amount of $10 in respect of the excluded COD income results in a positive adjustment of $20 to P's basis in the S1 stock. Accordingly, P's basis in S1 stock is $70.
(G)
Actual computation of stock gain or loss.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, P's actual gain or loss on the sale of the S1 stock is computed using the basis computed in the previous step. Accordingly, P recognizes a $30 gain on the disposition of the S1 stock.
(H)
Actual computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the tax imposed is computed by taking into account P's $30 gain from the sale of S1 stock. Before the application of § 1.1502-28, therefore, the group has a consolidated net operating loss of $370, $44 of which is attributable to P, $100 of which is attributable to S1, $132 of which is attributable to S2, $44 of which is attributable to S3, and $50 of which is attributable to S4.
(I)
Actual reduction of attributes.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section, sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are then actually applied to reduce attributes remaining after the actual computation of the tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S4 must first be reduced to take into account its $80 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 is reduced by $50, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S4 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $320. Then, pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(4), without regard to the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(A) of this section, S4's remaining $30 of excluded COD income would reduce the consolidated net operating loss for Year 1 by $30 ($4.12 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to P, $9.38 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1, $12.38 of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, and $4.12 of
the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S3) to $290. However, the limitation imposed by paragraph (c)(2)(ix)(A) of this section prevents the reduction of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to P, S2, and S3 by more than $4, $12, and $4 respectively. The $.62 of excluded COD income that would have otherwise reduced the consolidated net operating loss attributable to P, S2, and S3 is applied to reduce the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S1. Therefore, S1 carries forward $90 of loss.

# Example 4. Excess loss account taken into account.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group. On Day 1 of Year 2, P acquired all of the stock of S1. As of the beginning of Year 2, S1 had a $30 net operating loss carryover from Year 1, a separate return limitation year. A limitation under § 1.1502-21(c) applies to the use of that loss by the P group. For Years 1 and 2, the P group had no consolidated taxable income or loss. On Day 1 of Year 3, S1 acquired all of the stock of S2 for $10. In Year 3, P had ordinary income of $10, S1 had ordinary income of $25, and S2 had an ordinary loss of $50. In addition, in Year 3, S2 realized $20 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. After the discharge of this indebtedness, S2 had no liabilities. As of the beginning of Year 4, S2 had Asset A with a fair market value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 3 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28, Asset A has a basis of $0. S2 had no taxable income (or loss) for Year 1 and Year 2.
(ii)
Analysis.
The steps used to compute the tax imposed on the group, to effect the reduction of attributes, and to compute the limitations on the use and reduction of attributes are as follows:
(A)
Computation of limitation on deductions and losses to offset income or gain, tentative basis adjustments, tentative computation of stock gain or loss.
Because it is not initially apparent that there has been a disposition of stock, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not limit the use of deductions to offset income or gain, no adjustments to the basis are required pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and no stock gain or loss is computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section or taken into account in the tentative computation of tax imposed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(B)
Tentative computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the tax imposed for Year 3 is tentatively computed. For Year 3, the P group has a consolidated taxable loss of $15, all of which is attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(C)
Tentative reduction of attributes.
Next, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are tentatively applied to reduce attributes remaining after the tentative computation of tax imposed. Pursuant to § 1.1502-28(a)(2), the tax attributes attributable to S2 would first be reduced to take into account its $20 of excluded COD income. Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $15, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), to $0. The remaining $5 of excluded COD income is not applied to reduce attributes as there are no remaining attributes that are subject to reduction.
(D)
Actual adjustment of stock basis.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, § 1.1502-32 is applied to reflect the amount of S2's income and gain included, and unlimited deductions and losses that are absorbed, in the tentative computation of tax imposed for the year of the disposition and the excluded COD income tentatively applied to reduce attributes and the attributes reduced in respect of the excluded COD income pursuant to the previous step. Under § 1.1502-32, the absorption of $35 of S2's loss, the application of $15 in respect of S2's excluded COD income to reduce attributes, and the reduction of $15 in respect of the loss attributable to S2 reduced in respect of the excluded COD income results in a negative adjustment of $35 to the basis of the S2 stock. Therefore, S1 has an excess loss account of $25 in the S2 stock.
(E)
Actual computation of stock gain or loss.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, S1's actual gain or loss, if any, on the S2 stock is computed. Because S2 realized $5 of excluded COD income that was not applied to reduce attributes, pursuant to § 1.1502-19(b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii)(B), S1 is required to take into account $5 of its excess loss account in the S2 stock.
(F)
Actual computation of tax imposed.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the tax imposed is computed by taking into account the $5 of the excess loss account in the S2 stock required to be taken into account. See § 1.1502-28(b)(6) (requiring an excess loss account that is required to be taken into account as a result of the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B) to be included in the group's tax return for the year that includes the date of the debt discharge). However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, such amount may not be offset by any of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2. It may, however, subject to applicable limitations, be offset by the separate net operating loss of S1 from Year 1.
(G)
Actual reduction of attributes.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section, sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 are then actually applied to reduce attributes remaining after the actual computation of the tax imposed. Attributes will be actually reduced in the same way that they were tentatively reduced.

§ 1.1502-13
Intercompany transactions.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides rules for taking into account items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of members from intercompany transactions. The purpose of this section is to provide rules to clearly reflect the taxable income (and tax liability) of the group as a whole by preventing intercompany transactions from creating, accelerating, avoiding, or deferring consolidated taxable income (or consolidated tax liability).
(2)
Separate entity and single entity treatment.
Under this section, the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) are treated as separate entities for some purposes but as divisions of a single corporation for other purposes. The
amount
and
location
of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are determined on a separate entity basis (separate entity treatment). For example, S determines its gain or loss from a sale of property to B on a separate entity basis, and B has a cost basis in the property. The
timing,
and the
character, source,
and other
attributes
of the intercompany items and corresponding items, although initially determined on a separate entity basis, are redetermined under this section to produce the effect of transactions between divisions of a single corporation (single entity treatment). For example, if S sells land to B at a gain and B sells the land to a nonmember, S does not take its gain into account until B's sale to the nonmember.
(3)
Timing rules as a method of accounting
—(i)
In general.
The timing rules of this section are a method of accounting for intercompany transactions, to be applied by each member in addition to the member's other methods of accounting.
See
§§ 1.1502-17 and 1.446-1(c)(2)(iii). To the extent the timing rules of this section are inconsistent with a member's otherwise applicable methods of accounting, the timing rules of this section control. For example, if S sells property to B in exchange for B's note, the timing rules of this section apply instead of the installment sale rules of section 453. S's or B's application of the timing rules of this section to an intercompany transaction clearly reflects income only if the effect of that transaction as a whole (including, for example, related costs and expenses) on consolidated taxable income is clearly reflected.
(ii)
Automatic consent for joining and departing members
—(A)
Consent granted.
Section 446(e) consent is granted under this section to the extent a change in method of accounting is necessary solely by reason of the timing rules of this section—
(
1
) For each member, with respect to its intercompany transactions, in the first consolidated return year which follows a separate return year and in which the member engages in an intercompany transaction; and
(
2
) For each former member, with respect to its transactions with members that would otherwise be intercompany transactions if the former member were still a member, in the first separate return year in which the former member engages in such a transaction.
(B)
Cut-off basis.
Any change in method of accounting described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is to be effected on a cut-off basis for transactions entered into on or after the first day of the year for which consent is granted under paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(4)
Application of other rules of law.
See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments. The rules of this section apply in addition to other applicable law (including nonstatutory authorities). For example, this section applies in addition to sections 267(f) (additional rules for certain losses), 269 (acquisitions to evade or avoid income tax), and 482 (allocations among commonly controlled taxpayers). Thus, an item taken into account under this section can be deferred, disallowed, or eliminated under other applicable law, for example, section 1091 (losses from wash sales).
(5)
References.
References in other sections to this section include, as appropriate, references to prior law. For effective dates and prior law see paragraph (l) of this section.
(6)
Overview
—(i)
In general.
The principal rules of this section that implement single entity treatment are the matching rule and the acceleration rule of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Under the matching rule, S and B are generally treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of taking into account their items from intercompany transactions. The acceleration rule provides additional rules for taking the items into account if the effect of treating S and B as divisions cannot be achieved (for example, if S or B becomes a nonmember). Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (e) of this section provides simplifying rules for certain transactions. Paragraphs (f) and (g) of this
section provide additional rules for stock and obligations of members. Paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section provide anti-avoidance rules and miscellaneous operating rules.

Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Intercompany transactions
—(i)
In general.
An intercompany transaction is a transaction between corporations that are members of the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction. S is the member transferring property or providing services, and B is the member receiving the property or services. Intercompany transactions include—
(A) S's sale of property (or other transfer, such as an exchange or contribution) to B, whether or not gain or loss is recognized;
(B) S's performance of services for B, and B's payment or accrual of its expenditure for S's performance;
(C) S's licensing of technology, rental of property, or loan of money to B, and B's payment or accrual of its expenditure; and
(D) S's distribution to B with respect to S stock.
(ii)
Time of transaction.
If a transaction occurs in part while S and B are members and in part while they are not members, the transaction is treated as occurring when performance by either S or B takes place, or when payment for performance would be taken into account under the rules of this section if it were an intercompany transaction, whichever is earliest. Appropriate adjustments must be made in such cases by, for example, dividing the transaction into two separate transactions reflecting the extent to which S or B has performed.
(iii)
Separate transactions.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each transaction is analyzed separately. For example, if S simultaneously sells two properties to B, one at a gain and the other at a loss, each property is treated as sold in a separate transaction. Thus, the gain and loss cannot be offset or netted against each other for purposes of this section. Similarly, each payment or accrual of interest on a loan is a separate transaction. In addition, an accrual of premium is treated as a separate transaction, or as an offset to interest that is not a separate transaction, to the extent required under separate entity treatment. If two members exchange property, each member is S with respect to the property it transfers and B with respect to the property it receives. If two members enter into a notional principal contract, each payment under the contract is a separate transaction and the member making the payment is B with respect to that payment and the member receiving the payment is S. See paragraph (j)(4) of this section for rules aggregating certain transactions.
(2)
Intercompany items
—(i)
In general.
S's income, gain, deduction, and loss from an intercompany transaction are its intercompany items. For example, S's gain from the sale of property to B is intercompany gain. An item is an intercompany item whether it is directly or indirectly from an intercompany transaction.
(ii)
Related costs or expenses.
S's costs or expenses related to an intercompany transaction are included in determining its intercompany items. For example, if S sells inventory to B, S's direct and indirect costs properly includible under section 263A are included in determining its intercompany income. Similarly, related costs or expenses that are not capitalized under S's separate entity method of accounting are included in determining its intercompany items. For example, deductions for employee wages, in addition to other related costs, are included in determining S's intercompany items from performing services for B, and depreciation deductions are included in determining S's intercompany items from renting property to B.
(iii)
Amounts not yet recognized or incurred.
S's intercompany items include amounts from an intercompany transaction that are not yet taken into account under its separate entity method of accounting. For example, if S is a cash method taxpayer, S's intercompany income might be taken into account under this section even if the cash is not yet received. Similarly, an amount reflected in basis (or an amount equivalent to basis) under S's separate entity method of accounting that is a substitute for income, gain, deduction or loss from an intercompany transaction is an intercompany item.
(3)
Corresponding items
—(i)
In general.
B's income, gain, deduction, and loss from an intercompany transaction, or from property acquired in an intercompany transaction, are its corresponding items. For example, if B pays rent to S, B's deduction for the rent is a corresponding deduction. If B buys property from S and sells it to a nonmember, B's gain or loss from the sale to the nonmember is a corresponding gain or loss; alternatively, if B recovers the cost of the property through depreciation, B's depreciation deductions are corresponding deductions. An item is a corresponding item whether it is directly or indirectly from an intercompany transaction (or from property acquired in an intercompany transaction).
(ii)
Disallowed or eliminated amounts.
B's corresponding items include amounts that are permanently disallowed or permanently eliminated, whether directly or indirectly. Thus, corresponding items include amounts disallowed under section 265 (expenses relating to tax-exempt income), and amounts not recognized under section 311(a) (nonrecognition of loss on distributions), section 332 (nonrecognition on liquidating distributions), or section 355(c) (certain distributions of stock of a subsidiary). On the other hand, an amount is not permanently disallowed or permanently eliminated (and therefore is not a corresponding item) to the extent it is not recognized in a transaction in which B receives a successor asset within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1) of this section. For example, B's corresponding items do not include amounts not recognized from a transaction with a nonmember to which section 1031 applies or from another transaction in which B receives exchanged basis property.
(4)
Recomputed corresponding items.
The recomputed corresponding item is the corresponding item that B would take into account if S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany transaction were between those divisions. For example, if S sells property with a $70 basis to B for $100, and B later sells the property to a nonmember for $90, B's corresponding item is its $10 loss, and the recomputed corresponding item is $20 of gain (determined by comparing the $90 sales price with the $70 basis the property would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation). Although neither S nor B actually takes the recomputed corresponding item into account, it is computed as if B did take it into account (based on reasonable and consistently applied assumptions, including any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations that would affect its timing or attributes).
(5)
Treatment as a separate entity.
Treatment as a separate entity means treatment without application of the rules of this section, but with the application of the other consolidated return regulations. For example, if S sells the stock of another member to B, S's gain or loss on a separate entity basis is determined with the application of § 1.1502-80(b) (non-applicability of section 304), but without redetermination under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
(6)
Attributes.
The attributes of an intercompany item or corresponding item are all of the item's characteristics, except
amount, location,
and
timing,
necessary to determine the item's effect on taxable income (and tax liability). For example, attributes include character, source, treatment as excluded from gross income or as a noncapital, nondeductible amount, and treatment as built-in gain or loss under section 382(h) or 384. In contrast, the characteristics of property, such as a member's holding period, or the fact that property is included in inventory, are not attributes of an item, but these characteristics might affect the determination of the attributes of items from the property.
(c)
Matching rule.
For each consolidated return year, B's corresponding items and S's intercompany items are taken into account under the following rules:
(1)
Attributes and holding periods
—(i)
Attributes.
The separate entity attributes of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, and the intercompany transaction were a transaction between divisions. Thus, the activities of both S and B might affect the attributes of both intercompany items and corresponding items. For example, if S holds property for sale to unrelated customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, S sells the property to B at a gain and B sells the property to an unrelated person at a further gain, S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain might be ordinary because of S's activities with respect to the property. Similar principles apply if S performs services, rents property, or engages in any other intercompany transaction.
(ii)
Holding periods.
The holding period of property transferred in an intercompany transaction is the aggregate of the holding periods of S and B. However, if the basis of the property is determined by reference to the basis of other property, the property's holding period is determined by reference to the holding period of the other property. For example, if S distributes stock to B in a transaction to which section 355 applies, B's holding period in the distributed stock is determined by reference to B's holding period in the stock of S.
(2)
Timing
—(i)
B's items.
B takes its corresponding items into account under its accounting method, but the redetermination of the attributes of a corresponding item might affect its timing. For example, if B's sale of property acquired from S is treated as a dealer disposition because of S's activities, section 453(b) prevents any corresponding income of B from being taken into account under the installment method.
(ii)
S's items.
S takes its intercompany item into account to reflect the difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken into account and the recomputed corresponding item.
(3)
Divisions of a single corporation.
As divisions of a single corporation, S and B are treated as engaging in their actual transaction and owning any actual property involved in the transaction (rather than treating the transaction as not occurring). For example, S's sale of land held for investment to B for cash is not disregarded, but is treated as an exchange of land for cash between divisions (and B therefore succeeds to S's basis in the property). Similarly, S's issuance of its own stock to B in exchange for property is not disregarded, B is treated as owning the stock it receives in the exchange, and section 1032 does not apply to B on its subsequent sale of the S stock. Although treated as divisions, S and B nevertheless are treated as:
(i) Operating separate trades or businesses. See, e.g., § 1.446-1(d) (accounting
methods for a taxpayer engaged in more than one business).
(ii) Having any special status that they have under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations. For example, a bank defined in section 581, a domestic building and loan association defined in section 7701(a)(19), and an insurance company to which section 801 or 831 applies are treated as divisions having separate special status. On the other hand, the fact that a member holds property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business is not a special status.
(4)
Conflict or allocation of attributes.
This paragraph (c)(4) provides special rules for redetermining and allocating attributes under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(i)
Offsetting amounts
—(A)
In general.
To the extent B's corresponding item offsets S's intercompany item in amount, the attributes of B's corresponding item, determined based on both S's and B's activities, control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany item. For example, if S sells depreciable property to B at a gain and B depreciates the property, the attributes of B's depreciation deduction (ordinary deduction) control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany gain. Accordingly, S's gain is ordinary.
(B)
B controls unreasonable.
To the extent the results under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section are inconsistent with treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, the attributes of the offsetting items must be redetermined in a manner consistent with treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation. To the extent, however, that B's corresponding item on a separate entity basis is excluded from gross income, is a noncapital, nondeductible amount, or is otherwise permanently disallowed or eliminated, the attributes of B's corresponding item always control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany item.
(ii)
Allocation.
To the extent S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item do not offset in amount, the attributes redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must be allocated to S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item by using a method that is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances, including the purposes of this section and any other rule affected by the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. A method of allocation or redetermination is unreasonable if it is not used consistently by all members of the group from year to year.
(5)
Special status.
Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, to the extent an item's attributes determined under this section are permitted or not permitted to a member under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations by reason of the member's special status, the attributes required under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations apply to that member's items (but not the other member). For example, if S is a bank to which section 582(c) applies, and sells debt securities at a gain to B, a nonbank, the character of S's intercompany gain is ordinary as required under section 582(c), but the character of B's corresponding item as capital or ordinary is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section without the application of section 582(c). For other special status issues,
see,
for example, sections 818(b) (life insurance company treatment of capital gains and losses) and 1503(c) (limitation on absorption of certain losses).
(6)
Treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are excluded or nondeductible
—(i)
In general.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, S's intercompany item might be redetermined to be excluded from gross income or treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. For example, S's intercompany loss from the sale of property to B is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible amount if B distributes the property to a nonmember shareholder at no further gain or loss (because, if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the loss would not have been recognized under section 311(a)). Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, however, provides limitations on the application of this rule to intercompany income or gain. See also §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 (adjustments to S's stock basis and earnings and profits to reflect amounts so treated).
(ii)
Limitation on treatment of intercompany items as excluded from gross income.
Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, S's intercompany income or gain is redetermined to be excluded from gross income only to the extent one of the following applies:
(A)
Disallowed amounts.
B's corresponding item is a deduction or loss and, in the taxable year the item is taken into account under this section, it is permanently and explicitly disallowed under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations. For example, deductions that are disallowed under section 265 are permanently and explicitly disallowed. An amount is not permanently and explicitly disallowed, for example, to the extent that—
(
1
) The Internal Revenue Code or regulations provide that the amount is not recognized (for example, a loss that is realized but not recognized under section 332 or section 355(c) is not permanently and explicitly disallowed, notwithstanding that it is a corresponding item within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section (certain disallowed or eliminated amounts));
(
2
) A related amount might be taken into account by B with respect to successor property, such as under section 280B (demolition costs recoverable as capitalized amounts);
(
3
) A related amount might be taken into account by another taxpayer, such as under section 267(d) (disallowed loss under section 267(a) might result in nonrecognition of gain for a related person);
(
4
) A related amount might be taken into account as a deduction or loss, including as a carryforward to a later year, under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations (whether or not the carryforward expires in a later year); or
(
5
) The amount is reflected in the computation of any credit against (or other reduction of) Federal income tax (whether allowed for the taxable year or carried forward to a later year).
(B)
Section 311.
The corresponding item is a loss that is realized, but not recognized under section 311(a) on a distribution to a nonmember (even though the loss is not a permanently and explicitly disallowed amount within the meaning of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section).
(C)
Certain intercompany gains on stock
—(
1
)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, intercompany gain with respect to a member's stock that was created by reason of an intercompany transfer of the stock, and that would not otherwise be taken into account upon a subsequent elimination of the stock's basis but for the transfer, is redetermined to be excluded from gross income if—
(
i
) B or S becomes a successor (as defined in paragraph (j)(2) of this section) to the other party (either B or S), or a third member becomes a successor to both B and S;
(
ii
) Immediately before the intercompany gain would be taken into account, the successor member holds the member's stock with respect to which the intercompany gain was realized;
(
iii
) The successor member's basis in the member's stock that reflects the intercompany gain that is taken into account is eliminated without the recognition of gain or loss (and such eliminated basis is not further reflected in the basis of any successor asset);
(
iv
) The effects of the intercompany transaction have not previously been reflected, directly or indirectly, on the group's consolidated return; and
(
v
) The group has not derived, and no taxpayer will derive, any Federal income tax benefit from the intercompany transaction that gave rise to the intercompany gain or the redetermination of the intercompany gain (including any adjustment to basis in member stock under § 1.1502-32). For this purpose, the redetermination of the intercompany gain is not itself considered a Federal income tax benefit.
(
2
)
Effect on earnings and profits and investment adjustments.
Any amount excluded from gross income under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section shall not be taken into account as earnings and profits of any member and shall not be treated as tax-exempt income under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).
(D)
Other amounts.
(
1
) The Commissioner may determine that treating S's
intercompany item as excluded from gross income is consistent with the purposes of this section and other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and published guidance, if the following conditions are met, depending on whether the intercompany item is an item of income or an item of gain:
(
i
) In the case of an intercompany item of income, the corresponding item is permanently disallowed; or
(
ii
) If the intercompany item constitutes gain, the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
iv
) and (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
v
) of this section are satisfied.
(
2
) A determination by the Commissioner may be obtained only through a letter ruling request.
(7)
Examples
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, P is the common parent of the P consolidated group, P owns all of the only class of stock of subsidiaries S and B, X is a person unrelated to any member of the P group, the taxable year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, tax liabilities are disregarded, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, no member has any special status, and the transaction is not otherwise subject to recharacterization. If a member acts as both a selling member and a buying member (e.g., with respect to different aspects of a single transaction, or with respect to related transactions), the member is referred to as M, M1, or M2 (rather than as S or B).
(ii)
Matching rule.
The matching rule of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples.
(A)
Example 1. Intercompany sale of land followed by sale to a nonmember
—(
1
)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. S has held the land for more than one year. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. B also holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.
(
2
)
Definitions.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of the land to B is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and B is the buying member. Under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, S's $30 gain from the sale to B is its intercompany item, and B's $10 gain from the sale to X is its corresponding item.
(
3
)
Attributes.
Under the matching rule of paragraph (c) of this section, S's $30 intercompany gain and B's $10 corresponding gain are taken into account to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. In addition, the holding periods of S and B for the land are aggregated. Thus, the group's entire $40 of gain is long-term capital gain. Because both S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item on a separate entity basis are long-term capital gain, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(

)
Timing.
For each consolidated return year, S takes its intercompany item into account under the matching rule to reflect the difference for the year between B's corresponding item taken into account and the recomputed corresponding item. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and would have a $40 gain from the sale to X in Year 3, instead of a $10 gain. Consequently, S takes no gain into account in Years 1 and 2, and takes the entire $30 gain into account in Year 3, to reflect the $30 difference in that year between the $10 gain B takes into account and the $40 recomputed gain (the recomputed corresponding item). Under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33, P's basis in its S stock and the earnings and profits of S and P do not reflect S's $30 gain until the gain is taken into account in Year 3. (Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)

Intercompany loss followed by sale to a nonmember at a gain.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, except that S's basis in the land is $130 (rather than $70). The attributes and timing of S's intercompany loss and B's corresponding gain are determined under
the matching rule in the manner provided in
Example 1
in paragraphs (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
3
) and (
4
) of this section. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $130 basis in the land and would have a $20 loss from the sale to X instead of a $10 gain. Thus, S takes its entire $30 loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $20 recomputed loss. (The results are the same under section 267(f).) S's $30 loss is long-term capital loss, and B's $10 gain is long-term capital gain.
(

)
Intercompany gain followed by sale to a nonmember at a loss.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, except that B sells the land to X for $90 (rather than $110). The attributes and timing of S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding loss are determined under the matching rule. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and would have a $20 gain from the sale to X instead of a $10 loss. Thus, S takes its entire $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $10 loss taken into account and the $20 recomputed gain. S's $30 gain is long-term capital gain, and B's $10 loss is long-term capital loss.
(

)
Intercompany gain followed by distribution to a nonmember at a loss.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, except that B distributes the land to X, a minority shareholder of B, and at the time of the distribution the land has a fair market value of $90. The attributes and timing of S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding loss are determined under the matching rule. Under section 311(a), B does not recognize its $10 loss on the distribution to X. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between divisions, B would succeed to S's $70 basis in the land and would have a $20 gain from the distribution to X instead of an unrecognized $10 loss. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, B's loss that is not recognized under section 311(a) is a corresponding item. Thus, S takes its $30 gain into account under the matching rule in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10 corresponding unrecognized loss and the $20 recomputed gain. B's $10 corresponding loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control the attributes of S's intercompany item. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not prevent the redetermination of S's intercompany item as excluded from gross income. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section). Thus, $10 of S's $30 gain is redetermined to be excluded from gross income.
(

)
Intercompany sale followed by section 1031 exchange with nonmember.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, except that, instead of selling the land to X, B exchanges the land for land owned by X in a transaction to which section 1031 applies. There is no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken into account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule as a result of the section 1031 exchange. Instead, B's gain is preserved in the land received from X and, under the successor asset rule of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, S's intercompany gain is taken into account by reference to the replacement property. (If B takes gain into account as a result of boot received in the exchange, S's intercompany gain is taken into account under the matching rule to the extent the boot causes a difference between B's gain taken into account and the recomputed gain.)
(

)
Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to nonmember.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section, except that, instead of selling the land to X, B transfers the land to X in a transaction to which section 351(a) applies and X remains a nonmember. There is no difference in Year 3 between B's $0 corresponding item taken into account and the $0 recomputed corresponding item. Thus, none of S's intercompany gain is taken into account under the
matching rule as a result of the section 351(a) transfer. However, S's entire gain is taken into account in Year 3 under the acceleration rule of paragraph (d) of this section (because X, a nonmember, reflects B's $100 cost basis in the land under section 362).
(B)
Example 2. Dealer activities
—(
1
)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. B develops the land as residential real estate, and sells developed lots to customers during Year 3 for an aggregate amount of $110.
(
2
)
Attributes.
S and B are treated under the matching rule as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item. Thus, although S held the land for investment, whether the gain is treated as from the sale of property described in section 1221(1) is based on the activities of both S and B. If, based on both S's and B's activities, the land is described in section 1221(1), both S's gain and B's gain are ordinary income.
(C)
Example 3. Intercompany section 351 transfer
—(
1
)
Facts.
S holds land with a $70 basis and a $100 fair market value for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. On January 1 of Year 1, S transfers the land to B in exchange for all of the stock of B in a transaction to which section 351 applies. S has no gain or loss under section 351(a), and its basis in the B stock is $70 under section 358. Under section 362, B's basis in the land is $70. B holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $100. Assume that if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, B's gain from the sale would be ordinary income because of S's activities.
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's transfer to B is an intercompany transaction. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, S is treated as transferring the land in exchange for B's stock even though, as divisions, S could not own stock of B. S has no intercompany item, but B's $30 gain from its sale of the land to X is a corresponding item because the land was acquired in an intercompany transaction. B's $30 gain is ordinary income that is taken into account under B's method of accounting.
(

)
Intercompany section 351 transfer with boot.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, except that S receives $10 cash in addition to the B stock in the transfer. S recognizes $10 of gain under section 351(b), and its basis in the B stock is $70 under section 358. Under section 362, B's basis in the land is $80. S takes its $10 intercompany gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $10 difference between B's $20 corresponding gain taken into account and the $30 recomputed gain. Both S's $10 gain and B's $20 gain are ordinary income.
(

)
Partial disposition.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section, except B sells only a one- half, undivided interest in the land to X for $50. The timing and attributes are determined in the manner provided in
Example 3
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, except that S takes only $5 of its gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $5 difference between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $15 recomputed gain.
(D)
Example 4. Depreciable property
—(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1 of Year 1, S buys 10-year recovery property for $100 and depreciates it under the straight-line method. On January 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B for $130. Under section 168(i)(7), B is treated as S for purposes of section 168 to the extent B's $130 basis does not exceed S's adjusted basis at the time of the sale. B's additional basis is treated as new 10-year recovery property for which B elects the straight-line method of recovery. (To simplify the example, the half-year convention is disregarded.)
(
2
)
Depreciation through Year 3; intercompany gain.
S claims $10 of depreciation for each of Years 1 and 2 and has an $80 basis at the time of the sale to B. Thus, S has a $50 intercompany gain from its sale to B. For Year 3, B has $10 of depreciation with respect to $80 of its basis (the portion of its $130 basis not exceeding S's adjusted basis). In addition, B has $5 of depreciation with respect to the $50 of its additional basis that exceeds S's adjusted basis.
(
3
)
Timing.
S's $50 gain is taken into account to reflect the difference for
each consolidated return year between B's depreciation taken into account with respect to the property and the recomputed depreciation. For Year 3, B takes $15 of depreciation into account. If the intercompany transaction were a transfer between divisions of a single corporation, B would succeed to S's adjusted basis in the property and take into account only $10 of depreciation for Year 3. Thus, S takes $5 of gain into account in Year 3. In each subsequent year that B takes into account $15 of depreciation with respect to the property, S takes into account $5 of gain.
(
4
)
Attributes.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the attributes of S's gain and B's depreciation must be redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if the intercompany transaction were between divisions of a single corporation (the group must have a net depreciation deduction of $10). In each year, $5 of B's corresponding depreciation deduction offsets S's $5 intercompany gain taken into account and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control the attributes of S's intercompany item. Accordingly, S's intercompany gain that is taken into account as a result of B's depreciation deduction is ordinary income.
(

)
Sale of property to a nonmember.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section, except that B sells the property to X on January 1 of Year 5 for $110. As set forth in
Example 4
in paragraphs (c)(7)(ii)(D)(
3
) and (
4
) of this section, B has $15 of depreciation with respect to the property in each of Years 3 and 4, causing S to take $5 of intercompany gain into account in each year as ordinary income. The $40 balance of S's intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 5 as a result of B's sale to X, to reflect the $40 difference between B's $10 gain taken into account and the $50 of recomputed gain ($110 of sale proceeds minus the $60 basis B would have if the intercompany sale were a transfer between divisions of a single corporation). Treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, $40 of the gain is section 1245 gain and $10 is section 1231 gain. On a separate entity basis, S would have more than $10 treated as section 1231 gain, and B would have no amount treated as section 1231 gain. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, all $10 of the section 1231 gain is allocated to S. S's remaining $30 of gain, and all of B's $10 gain, is treated as section 1245 gain.
(E)
Example 5. Intercompany sale followed by installment sale
—(
1
)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70x. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100x. B also holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X in exchange for X's $110x note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55x in Year 4 and $55x in Year 5. The interest charge under section 453A(c) applies to X's note.
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
S takes its $30x gain into account to reflect the difference in each consolidated return year between B's gain taken into account for the year and the recomputed gain. Under section 453, B takes into account $5x of gain in Year 4 and $5x of gain in Year 5. Thus, S takes into account $15x of gain in Year 4 and $15x of gain in Year 5 to reflect the $15x difference in each of those years between B's $5x gain taken into account and the $20x recomputed gain. Both S's $30x gain and B's $10x gain are subject to the section 453A(c) interest charge beginning in Year 3.
(

)
Election out under section 453(d).
If, under the facts in
Example 5
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section, the P group wishes to elect not to apply section 453 with respect to S's gain, an election under section 453(d) must be made for Year 3 with respect to B's gain. This election will cause B's $10x gain to be taken into account in Year 3. Under the matching rule, this will result in S's $30x gain being taken into account in Year 3. (An election by the P group solely with respect to S's gain has no effect because the gain from S's sale to B is taken into account under the matching rule, and therefore must reflect the difference between B's gain taken into account and the recomputed gain.)
(

)
Sale to a nonmember at a loss, but overall gain.
The facts are the same as
in
Example 5
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section, except that B sells the land to X in exchange for X's $90x note (rather than $110x note). If S and B were divisions of a single corporation, B would succeed to S's basis in the land, and the sale to X would be eligible for installment reporting under section 453, because it resulted in an overall gain. However, because only gains may be reported on the installment method, B's $10x corresponding loss is taken into account in Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section the recomputed corresponding item is $20x gain that would be taken into account under the installment method, $0 in Year 3 and $10x in each of Years 4 and 5. Thus, in Year 3 S takes $10x of gain into account to reflect the difference between B's $10x loss taken into account and the $0 recomputed gain for Year 3. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, B's $10x corresponding loss offsets $10x of S's intercompany gain, and B's attributes control. S takes $10x of gain into account in each of Years 4 and 5 to reflect the difference in those years between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $10x recomputed gain that would be taken into account under the installment method. Only the $20x of S's gain taken into account in Years 4 and 5 is subject to the interest charge under section 453A(c) beginning in Year 3. (If P elects under section 453(d) for Year 3 not to apply section 453 with respect to the gain, all of S's $30x gain will be taken into account in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x loss taken into account and the $20x recomputed gain.)
(
5
)
Intercompany loss, installment gain.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section, except that S has a $130x (rather than $70x) basis in the land. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the separate entity attributes of S's and B's items from the intercompany transaction must be redetermined to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and tax liability) as if the transaction had been a transfer between divisions. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation, B would succeed to S's basis in the land and the group would have $20x loss from the sale to X, installment reporting would be unavailable, and the interest charge under section 453A(c) would not apply. Accordingly, B's gain from the transaction is not eligible for installment treatment under section 453. B takes its $10x gain into account in Year 3, and S takes its $30x of loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $10x gain and the $20x recomputed loss.
(

)
Recapture income.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section, except that S bought depreciable property (rather than land) for $100x, claimed depreciation deductions, and reduced the property's basis to $70x before Year 1. (To simplify the example, B's depreciation is disregarded.) If the intercompany sale of property had been a transfer between divisions of a single corporation, $30x of the $40x gain from the sale to X would be section 1245 gain (which is ineligible for installment reporting) and $10x would be section 1231 gain (which is eligible for installment reporting). On a separate entity basis, S would have $30x of section 1245 gain and B would have $10x of section 1231 gain. Accordingly, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. All of B's $10x gain is eligible for installment reporting and is taken into account $5x each in Years 4 and 5 (and is subject to the interest charge under section 453A(c)). S's $30x gain is taken into account in Year 3 to reflect the difference between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $30x of recomputed gain. (If S had bought the depreciable property for $110x and its recomputed basis under section 1245 had been $110x (rather than $100x), B's $10x gain and S's $30x gain would both be recapture income ineligible for installment reporting.)
(F)
Example 6. Intercompany sale of installment obligation
—(
1
)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70x. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to X in exchange for X's $100x note, and S reports its gain on the installment method under section 453. X's note bears interest at a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $50x in Year 5 and $50x in Year 6. Section 453A applies to X's note. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells
X's note to B for $100x, resulting in $30x gain from S's prior sale of the land to X under section 453B(a).
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
S's sale of X's note to B is an intercompany transaction, and S's $30x gain is intercompany gain. S takes $15x of the gain into account in each of Years 5 and 6 to reflect the $15x difference in each year between B's $0 gain taken into account and the $15x recomputed gain. S's gain continues to be treated as its gain from the sale to X, and the deferred tax liability remains subject to the interest charge under section 453A(c).
(

)
Worthlessness.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(F)(
1
) of this section, except that X's note becomes worthless on December 1 of Year 3 and B has a $100x short-term capital loss under section 165(g) on a separate entity basis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, B's holding period for X's note is aggregated with S's holding period. Thus, B's loss is a long- term capital loss. S takes its $30x gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30x difference between B's $100x loss taken into account and the $70x recomputed loss. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, S's gain is long-term capital gain.
(
4
)
Pledge.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(F)(
1
) of this section, except that, on December 1 of Year 3, B borrows $100x from an unrelated bank and secures the indebtedness with X's note. X's note remains subject to section 453A(d) following the sale to B. Under section 453A(d), B's $100x of proceeds from the secured indebtedness is treated as an amount received on December 1 of Year 3 by B on X's note. Thus, S takes its entire $30x gain into account in Year 3.
(G)
Example 7. Performance of services
—(
1
)
Facts.
S is a driller of water wells. B operates a ranch in a remote location, and B's taxable income from the ranch is not subject to section 447. B's ranch requires water to maintain its cattle. During Year 1, S drills an artesian well on B's ranch in exchange for $100 from B, and S incurs $80 of expenses (e.g., for employees and equipment). B capitalizes its $100 cost for the well under section 263, and takes into account $10 of cost recovery deductions in each of Years 2 through 11. Under its separate entity method of accounting, S would take its income and expenses into account in Year 1. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the costs incurred in drilling the well would be capitalized.
(
2
)
Definitions.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the service transaction is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and B is the buying member. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S's $100 of income and $80 of related expenses are both included in determining its intercompany income of $20.
(
3
)
Timing and attributes.
S's $20 of intercompany income is taken into account under the matching rule to reflect the $20 difference between B's corresponding items taken into account (based on its $100 cost basis in the well) and the recomputed corresponding items (based on the $80 basis that B would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation and B's basis were determined by reference to S's $80 of expenses). In Year 1, S takes into account $80 of its income and the $80 of expenses. In each of Years 2 through 11, S takes $2 of its $20 intercompany income into account to reflect the annual $2 difference between B's $10 of cost recovery deductions taken into account and the $8 of recomputed cost recovery deductions. S's $100 income and $80 expenses, and B's cost recovery deductions, are ordinary items (because S's and B's items would be ordinary on a separate entity basis, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). If S's offsetting $80 of income and expense would not be taken into account in the same year under its separate entity method of accounting, they nevertheless must be taken into account under this section in a manner that clearly reflects consolidated taxable income. See paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(

)
Sale of capitalized services.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(G)(
1
) of this section, except that B sells the ranch before Year 11 and recognizes gain attributable to the well. To the extent of S's income taken into account as a result of B's cost recovery deductions, as well as S's offsetting $80 of income and expense, the timing and attributes are
determined in the manner provided in
Example 7
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(G)(
3
) of this section. The attributes of the remainder of S's $20 of income and B's gain from the sale are redetermined to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Accordingly, S's remaining intercompany income is treated as recapture income or section 1231 gain, even though it is from S's performance of services.
(H)
Example 8. Rental of property.
B operates a ranch that requires grazing land for its cattle. S owns undeveloped land adjoining B's ranch. On January 1 of Year 1, S leases grazing rights to B for Year 1. B's $100 rent expense is deductible for Year 1 under its separate entity accounting method. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the rental transaction is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and B is the buying member. S takes its $100 of income into account in Year 1 to reflect the $100 difference between B's rental deduction taken into account and the $0 recomputed rental deduction. S's income and B's deduction are ordinary items (because S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate entity basis, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section).

Example 9. Intercompany sale of a partnership interest
—(
1
)
Facts.
S owns a 20% interest in the capital and profits of a general partnership. The partnership holds land for investment with a basis equal to its value, and operates depreciable assets which have value in excess of basis. S's basis in its partnership interest equals its share of the adjusted basis of the partnership's land and depreciable assets. The partnership has an election under section 754 in effect. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells its partnership interest to B at a gain. During Years 1 through 10, the partnership depreciates the operating assets, and B's depreciation deductions from the partnership reflect the increase in the basis of the depreciable assets under section 743(b).
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
S's gain is taken into account during Years 1 through 10 to reflect the difference in each year between B's depreciation deductions from the partnership taken into account and the recomputed depreciation deductions from the partnership. Under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section, S's gain taken into account is ordinary income. (The acceleration rule does not apply to S's gain as a result of the section 743(b) adjustment, because the adjustment is solely with respect to B and therefore no nonmember reflects any part of the intercompany transaction.)

)
Partnership sale of assets.
The facts are the same as in
Example 9
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(I)(
1
) of this section, and the partnership sells some of its depreciable assets to X at a gain on December 31 of Year 4. In addition to the intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the partnership's depreciation, S takes intercompany gain into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's partnership items taken into account from the sale (which reflect the basis increase under section 743(b)) and the recomputed partnership items. The attributes of S's additional gain are redetermined to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation (recapture income or section 1231 gain).

) of this section, and on December 31 of Year 4, B sells its partnership interest to X at no gain or loss. In addition to the intercompany gain taken into account as a result of the partnership's depreciation, the remaining balance of S's intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's $0 gain taken into account from the sale of the partnership interest and the recomputed gain. The character of S's remaining intercompany item and B's corresponding item are determined on a separate entity basis under section 751, and then redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect as treating the intercompany transaction as occurring between divisions of a single corporation.

) of this section, except that the partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect, and B
recognizes a capital loss from its sale of the partnership interest to X on December 31 of Year 4. Because there is no difference between B's depreciation deductions from the partnership taken into account and the recomputed depreciation deductions, S does not take any of its gain into account during Years 1 through 4 as a result of B's partnership's items. Instead, S's entire intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 4 to reflect the difference between B's loss taken into account from the sale to X and the recomputed gain or loss.

Example 10. Net operating losses subject to section 382 or the SRLY rules
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. S has net operating loss carryovers from prior years. P's acquisition results in an ownership change under section 382 with respect to S's loss carryovers, and S has a net unrealized built-in gain (within the meaning of section 382(h)(3)). S owns nondepreciable property with a $70 basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells the property to B for $100, and its $30 gain is recognized built-in gain (within the meaning of section 382(h)(2)) on a separate entity basis. On December 1 of Year 5, B sells the property to X for $90.
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
S's $30 gain is taken into account in Year 5 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $10 loss taken into account and the recomputed $20 gain. S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of applying section 382 in connection with the intercompany transaction. Under a single entity analysis, the single corporation has losses subject to limitation under section 382, and this limitation may be increased under section 382(h) if the single corporation has recognized built-in gain with respect to those losses. B's $10 corresponding loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain, and thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, $10 of S's intercompany gain is redetermined not to be recognized built-in gain. S's remaining $20 intercompany gain continues to be treated as recognized built-in gain.

B's recognized built-in gain.
The facts are the same as in

in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(J)(

) of this section, except that the property declines in value after S becomes a member of the P group, S sells the property to B for its $70 basis, and B sells the property to X for $90 during Year 5. Treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, S's sale to B does not cause the property to cease to be built-in gain property. Thus, B's $20 gain from its sale to X is recognized built-in gain that increases the section 382 limitation applicable to S's losses.

SRLY limitation.
The facts are the same as in
Example 10
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(J)(
1
) of this section, except that P's acquisition of S is not subject to the overlap rule of § 1.1502-21(g), and S's net operating loss carryovers are subject to the separate return limitation year (SRLY) rules. See § 1.1502-21(c). The application of the SRLY rules depends on S's status as a separate corporation having losses from separate return limitation years. Under paragraph (c)(5), the attribute of S's intercompany item as it relates to S's SRLY limitation is not redetermined, because the SRLY limitation depends on S's special status. Accordingly, S's $30 intercompany gain is included in determining its SRLY limitation for Year 5.

Example 11. Section 475
—(

)
Facts.
S, a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c), owns a security with a basis of $70. The security is held for sale to customers and is not identified under section 475(b) as within an exception to marking to market. On July 1 of Year 1, S sells the security to B for $100. B is not a dealer and holds the security for investment. On December 31 of Year 1, the fair market value of the security is $100. On July 1 of Year 2, B sells the security to X for $110.
(
2
)
Attributes.
Under section 475, a dealer in securities can treat a security as within an exception to marking to market under section 475(b) only if it timely identifies the security as so described. Under the matching rule, attributes must be redetermined by treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation. As a result of S's activities, the single corporation is treated as a dealer with respect to securities, and B must continue to mark to market the security acquired from S. Thus,
B's corresponding items and the recomputed corresponding items are determined by continuing to treat the security as not within an exception to marking to market. Under section 475(d)(3), it is possible for the character of S's intercompany items to differ from the character of B's corresponding items.
(
3
)
Timing and character.
S has a $30 gain when it disposes of the security by selling it to B. This gain is intercompany gain that is taken into account in Year 1 to reflect the $30 difference between B's $0 gain taken into account from marking the security to market under section 475 and the recomputed $30 gain that would be taken into account. The character of S's gain and B's gain are redetermined as if the security were transferred between divisions. Accordingly, S's gain is ordinary income under section 475(d)(3)(A)(i), but under section 475(d)(3)(B)(ii) B's $10 gain from its sale to X is capital gain that is taken into account in Year 2.
(

)
Nondealer to dealer.
The facts are the same as in
Example 11
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(K)(
1
) of this section, except that S is not a dealer and holds the security for investment with a $70 basis, B is a dealer to which section 475 applies and, immediately after acquiring the security from S for $100, B holds the security for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Because S is not a dealer and held the security for investment, the security is treated as properly identified as held for investment under section 475(b)(1) until it is sold to B. Under section 475(b)(3), the security thereafter ceases to be described in section 475(b)(1) because B holds the security for sale to customers. The mark-to-market requirement applies only to changes in the value of the security after B's acquisition. B's mark-to-market gain taken into account and the recomputed mark-to-market gain are both determined based on changes from the $100 value of the security at the time of B's acquisition. There is no difference between B's $0 mark-to-market gain taken into account in Year 1 and the $0 recomputed mark-to-market gain. Therefore, none of S's gain is taken into account in Year 1 as a result of B's marking the security to market in Year 1. In Year 2, B has a $10 gain when it disposes of the security by selling it to X, but would have had a $40 gain if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, S takes its $30 gain into account in Year 2 under the matching rule. Under section 475(d)(3), S's gain is capital gain even though B's subsequent gain or loss from marking to market or disposing of the security is ordinary gain or loss. If B disposes of the security at a $10 loss in Year 2, S's gain taken into account in Year 2 is still capital because on a single entity basis section 475(d)(3) would provide for $30 of capital gain and $10 of ordinary loss. Because the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section does not apply. Furthermore, if B held the security for investment, and so identified the security under section 475(b)(1), the security would continue to be excepted from marking to market.

Example 12. Section 1092
—(

)
Facts.
On July 1 of Year 1, S enters into offsetting long and short positions with respect to actively traded personal property. The positions are not section 1256 contracts, and they are the only positions taken into account for purposes of applying section 1092. On August 1 of Year 1, S sells the long position to B at an $11 loss, and there is $11 of unrealized gain in the offsetting short position. On December 1 of Year 1, B sells the long position to X at no gain or loss. On December 31 of Year 1, there is still $11 of unrealized gain in the short position. On February 1 of Year 2, S closes the short position at an $11 gain.
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
If the sale from S to B were a transfer between divisions of a single corporation, the $11 loss on the sale to X would have been deferred under section 1092(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, there is no difference in Year 1 between B's corresponding item of $0 and the recomputed corresponding item of $0. S takes its $11 loss into account in Year 2 to reflect the difference between B's corresponding item of $0 taken into account in Year 2 and the recomputed loss of $11 that would have been taken into account in Year 2 under section 1092(a)(1)(B) if S and B
had been divisions of a single corporation. (The results are the same under section 267(f)).

Intercompany sale

)
Facts.
S manufactures inventory property solely in the United States and recognizes $75x of income on sales to B in Year 1. B conducts further production activity on the inventory property solely in Country Y and then sells the inventory property to X in Country Y and recognizes $25x of income on the sale to X, also in Year 1. Title passes from S to B, and from B to X, in Country Y. Assume that applying § 1.863-3 on a single entity basis, including the formula for apportionment of multi-country production activities by reference to the basis of production assets, $10x would be treated as foreign source income and $90x would be treated as U.S. source income (that is, 10 percent of the production occurred outside the United States and 90 percent occurred within the United States, as measured by the basis of assets used in production activities with respect to the property). Assume further that, on a separate entity basis, S would have $0x of foreign source income and $75x of U.S. source income and all of B's $25x of income would be foreign source income.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under the matching rule, both S's $75x intercompany item and B's $25x corresponding item are taken into account in Year 1. In determining the source of S and B's income from the inventory property sales, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. See paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. On a single entity basis, S and B would have $10x that would be treated as foreign source income and $90x that would be treated as U.S. source income, but without application of this section (that is, on a separate entity basis), S would have $75x of U.S. source income and B would have $25x of foreign source income. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a redetermined attribute must be allocated between S and B using a reasonable method. On a separate entity basis B would have only foreign source income and S would have only U.S. source income. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, $15x of B's $25x sales income that would be treated as foreign source income on a separate entity basis is redetermined to be U.S. source income.

Facts.
S earns $10x of income performing services in the United States for B. B capitalizes S's fees into the basis of inventory property that it manufactures in the United States and sells to an unrelated person in Year 1 at a $90x profit, with title passing in Country Y. Assume that on a single entity basis, $100x is treated as U.S. source income and $0x is treated as foreign source income. Further assume that on a separate entity basis, S would have $10x of U.S. source income, and B would have $90x of U.S. source income, with neither having any foreign source income.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under the matching rule, S's $10x income and B's $90x income are taken into account in Year 1. In determining the source of S and B's income, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Because the results are the same on a single entity basis and a separate entity basis ($100x of U.S. source income and $0x of foreign source income), the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

Example 15. Section 1248
—(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1 of Year 1, S forms FT, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, with a $10 contribution. During Years 1 through 3, FT has earnings and profits of $40. None of the earnings and profits is taxed as subpart F income under section 951, and FT distributes no dividends to S during this period. On January 1 of Year 4, S sells its FT stock to B for $50. While B owns FT, FT has a deficit in earnings and profits of $10. On July 1 of Year 6, B sells its FT stock for $70 to X, an unrelated foreign corporation.
(
2
)
Timing.
S's $40 of intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 6 to reflect the difference between B's $20 of gain taken into account and the $60 recomputed gain.
(
3
)
Attributes.
Under the matching rule, the attributes of S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain are redetermined to have the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. On a single entity basis, there is $60 of gain and the portion which is characterized as a dividend under section 1248 is determined on the basis of FT's $30 of earnings and profits at the time of the sale of FT to X (the sum of FT's $40 of earnings and profits while held by S and FT's $10 deficit in earnings and profits while held by B). Therefore, $30 of the $60 gain is treated as a dividend under section 1248. The remaining $30 is treated as capital gain. On a separate entity basis, all of S's $40 gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248 and all of B's $20 gain would be treated as capital gain. Thus, as a result of the single entity determination, $10 that would be treated as a dividend under section 1248 on a separate entity basis is redetermined to be capital gain. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, this redetermined attribute must be allocated between S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item by using a reasonable method. On a separate entity basis, only S would have any amount treated as a dividend under section 1248 available for redetermination. Accordingly, $10 of S's income is redetermined to be not subject to section 1248, with the result that $30 of S's intercompany gain is treated as a dividend and the remaining $10 is treated as capital gain. All of B's corresponding gain is treated as capital gain, as it would be on a separate entity basis.
(

)
B has loss.
The facts are the same as in
Example 15
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(O)(
1
) of this section, except that FT has no earnings and profits or deficit in earnings and profits while B owns FT, and B sells the FT stock to X for $40. On a single entity basis, there is $30 of gain, and section 1248 is applied on the basis of FT's $40 earnings and profits at the time of the sale of FT to X. Under section 1248, the amount treated as a dividend is limited to $30 (the amount of the gain). On a separate entity basis, S's entire $40 gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248, and B's $10 loss would be a capital loss. B's $10 corresponding loss offsets $10 of S's intercompany gain and, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item control. Accordingly, $10 of S's gain must be redetermined to be capital gain. B's $10 loss remains a capital loss. (If, however, S sold FT to B at a loss and B sold FT to X at a gain, it may be unreasonable for the attributes of B's corresponding gain to control S's offsetting intercompany loss. If B's attributes were to control, for example, the group could possibly claim a larger foreign tax credit than would be available if S and B were divisions of a single corporation.)

Example 16. Intercompany stock distribution followed by section 332 liquidation
—(

)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S, S owns all the stock of T, a member of the P group, and T owns all of the stock of T1, also a member of the P group. On January 1 of Year 1, S distributes all of the T stock to P in a distribution to which section 301 applies. At the time of this distribution, the value of the T stock is $100 and S has a $40 basis in the T stock. Under section 311(b), the distribution creates $60 of intercompany gain to S. Under section 301(d), P's basis in the T stock is $100. S will take its $60 intercompany gain into account under the matching rule. On January 1 of Year 4, in an independent transaction, S distributes all of its assets to P in a complete liquidation to which section 332 applies, and, under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, P succeeds to S's $60 gain. On January 1 of Year 7, T distributes all of its T1 stock to P in a transaction to which section 355 applies. At the time of this distribution, P has a basis in the T stock of $100, the value of the T stock (without regard to T1) is $75, and the value of the T1 stock is $25. Under section 358, P allocates $25 of its $100 basis in the T stock to the T1 stock, and, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the T1 stock becomes a successor asset to the T stock. On January 1 of Year 9, in an independent transaction,
T distributes all of its assets to P in a complete liquidation to which section 332 applies.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, S's distribution in Year 1 of the T stock to P is an intercompany transaction, S is the selling member, and P is the buying member. In Year 9 when T liquidates, P has no gain or loss under section 332. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, P's $0 gain or loss with respect to the T stock under section 332 is a corresponding item. P takes $45 (75/100 × $60) of its intercompany gain into account under the matching rule in Year 9 to reflect the difference between P's $0 of unrecognized gain and P's $45 of recomputed unrecognized gain. (If P and S were divisions of a single corporation, P would have had a $40 basis in the T stock, and, after the Year 7 distribution of the T1 stock, would have held the T stock with a $30 basis.) However, paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not prevent the redetermination of P's intercompany gain as excluded from gross income provided P succeeds to S's intercompany item; P and S are a single entity; P's basis in the T stock that reflects the $45 intercompany gain taken into account is eliminated without the recognition of gain or loss (and this eliminated basis is not further reflected in the basis of any successor asset); the group has not derived and no taxpayer will derive any Federal income tax benefit from the basis in the T stock and will not derive any Federal income tax benefit from a redetermination of this portion of the gain; and the effects of the intercompany transaction have not previously been reflected, directly or indirectly, on the P group's consolidated return. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.) Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, the $45 intercompany gain that P takes into account is redetermined to be excluded from gross income. P's basis in its T1 stock continues to reflect $15 of intercompany gain.

Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 16
in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(P) of this section, except that T does not distribute the stock of T1, instead, in Year 7, T makes a distribution of $50 to P in a transaction to which section 301 applies. Under § 1.1502-32, P's basis in its T stock is reduced by $50 and, under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the intercompany distribution is excluded from P's gross income. Further, in Year 9, instead of liquidating T, P distributes the T stock to its shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies.
(
2
)
Analysis.
On the distribution of the T stock in Year 9, P has $0 of unrecognized gain under section 355(c). Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, P's $0 of unrecognized gain or loss with respect to the T stock under section 355(c) is a corresponding item. P takes its $60 intercompany gain into account under the matching rule in Year 9 to reflect the difference between P's $0 of unrecognized gain and P's $60 of recomputed gain ($50 unrecognized gain and $10 recognized gain). (If P and S were divisions of a single corporation, P would have had a $40 basis in the T stock, and, after the Year 7 distribution, would have held the T stock with a $10 excess loss account.) See
Example 2
in paragraph (f)(7) of this section. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not prevent the redetermination of P's intercompany gain as excluded from gross income provided P succeeds to S's intercompany item; P and S are a single entity; P's basis in the T stock that reflects the $60 intercompany gain taken into account is eliminated without the recognition of gain or loss (and this eliminated basis is not further reflected in any successor asset); the group has not derived any Federal income tax benefit from the basis in the T stock and will not derive any Federal income tax benefit from a redetermination of this portion of the gain; and the effects of the intercompany transaction have not previously been reflected, directly or indirectly, on the P group's consolidated return. (See paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.) The intercompany transaction with respect to the T stock resulted in an increase in the basis of the T stock, and this increase in the basis of the T stock prevented P from holding the T stock with a $10 excess loss account (as a result of the Year 7 distribution) at the time of
the section 355 distribution. Accordingly, the group derived a Federal income tax benefit from the intercompany transaction to the extent of $10 and, under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, only $50 of the $60 intercompany gain that P takes into account is redetermined to be excluded from gross income.
(

)
Application of section 355(e).
If it were determined that section 355(e) applied to P's distribution of the T stock, P would recognize $0 of gain and derive a Federal income tax benefit to the extent of the full $60 increase in the basis of the T stock. Therefore, no portion of P's intercompany gain would be redetermined to be excluded from gross income under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.

Example 18: Redetermination of attributes for section 250 purposes
—(

Facts.
S manufactures equipment in the United States and recognizes $75 of gross income included in gross DEI (as defined in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(15)) on the sale of Asset, which is not depreciable property, to B in Year 1 for $100. In Year 2, B sells Asset to X for $125 and recognizes $25 of gross income. The sale is a FDDEI sale (as defined in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(8)), and thus the $25 of income is included in B's gross FDDEI (as defined in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(16)) for Year 2.
(
2
)
Timing and attributes.
S's $75 of intercompany income is taken into account in Year 2 under the matching rule to reflect the $75 difference between B's $25 corresponding item taken into account (based on B's $100 cost basis in Asset) and the recomputed corresponding item (based on the $25 basis that B would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation and B's basis were determined by reference to S's basis). In determining whether S's gross income included in gross DEI from the sale of Asset is included in gross FDDEI, S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation. See paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In determining the amount of income included in gross DEI that is included in gross FDDEI, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item may be redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. See paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Applying section 250 and § 1.1502-50 on a single entity basis, all $100 of income included in gross DEI would be gross FDDEI. On a separate entity basis, S would have $75 of gross income included in gross DEI that is included in gross RDEI (as defined in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(14)) and B would have $25 of gross income included in gross DEI that is included in gross FDDEI. Thus, on a separate entity basis, S and B would have, in the aggregate, $100 of gross income included in gross DEI, of which only $25 is included gross FDDEI. Accordingly, under single entity treatment, $75 that would be treated as gross income included in gross DEI that is included in gross RDEI on a separate entity basis is redetermined to be included in gross FDDEI.

Intercompany sale for loss.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)(ii)(R)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 18
), except that S recognizes $25 of loss on the sale of Asset. S's $25 of intercompany loss is taken into account under the matching rule to reflect the $25 difference between B's $25 corresponding item taken into account (based on B's $100 cost basis in Asset) and the recomputed corresponding item (based on the $125 basis that B would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation and B's basis were determined by reference to S's $125 of costs). Applying section 250 and § 1.1502-50 on a single entity basis, $0 of income would be included in gross DEI. In order to reflect this result, under the matching rule, S's $25 loss is allocated and apportioned solely to B's $25 of gross income from the sale of Asset for purposes of determining B's DEI and FDDEI. Furthermore, B's $25 of gross income is not taken into account for purposes of apportioning any other deductions under section 861 and the regulations under that section for purposes of determining any member's DEI or FDDEI.

(A) To the extent an intercompany item or corresponding item will not be taken into account in determining the group's consolidated taxable income (or consolidated tax liability) under the matching rule (for example, if S or B becomes a nonmember, or if S's intercompany item is no longer reflected in the difference between B's basis (or an amount equivalent to basis) in property and the basis (or equivalent amount) the property would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation); or
(B) To the extent a nonmember reflects, directly or indirectly, any aspect of the intercompany transaction (e.g., if B's cost basis in property purchased from S is reflected by a nonmember under section 362 following a section 351 transaction).
(ii)
Attributes.
The attributes of S's intercompany items taken into account under this paragraph (d)(1) are determined as follows:
(A)
Sale, exchange, or distribution.
If the item is from an intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, its attributes are determined under the principles of the matching rule as if B sold the property, at the time the item is taken into account under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the property (i.e., at no net gain or loss), to the following person:
(
1
)
Property leaves the group.
If the property is owned by a nonmember immediately after S's item is taken into account, B is treated as selling the property to that nonmember. If the nonmember is related for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations to any party to the intercompany transaction (or any related transaction) or to the common parent, the nonmember is treated as related to B for purposes of that provision. For example, if the nonmember is related to P within the meaning of section 1239(b), the deemed sale is treated as being described in section 1239(a). See paragraph (j)(6) of this section, under which property is not treated as being owned by a nonmember if it is owned by the common parent after the common parent becomes the only remaining member.
(
2
)
Property does not leave the group.
If the property is not owned by a nonmember immediately after S's item is taken into account, B is treated as selling the property to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group.
(B)
Other transactions.
If the item is from an intercompany transaction other than a sale, exchange, or distribution of property (e.g., income from S's services capitalized by B), its attributes are determined on a separate entity basis.
(2)
B's items
—(i)
Attributes.
The attributes of B's corresponding items continue to be redetermined under the principles of the matching rule, with the following adjustments:
(A) If S and B continue to join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding items (and any applicable holding periods) are determined by continuing to treat S and B as divisions of a single corporation.
(B) Once S and B no longer join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding items are determined as if the S division (but not the B division) were transferred by the single corporation to an unrelated person. Thus, S's
activities (and any applicable holding period) before the intercompany transaction continue to affect the attributes of the corresponding items (and any applicable holding period).
(ii)
Timing.
If paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to S, B nevertheless continues to take its corresponding items into account under its accounting method. However, the redetermination of the attributes of a corresponding item under this paragraph (d)(2) might affect its timing.
(3)
Examples.
The acceleration rule of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.
(i)
Example 1. Becoming a nonmember—timing
—(A)
Facts.
S owns land with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. On July 1 of Year 3, P sells 60% of S's stock to X for $60 and, as a result, S becomes a nonmember.
(B)
Matching rule.
Under the matching rule, none of S's $30 gain is taken into account in Years 1 through 3 because there is no difference between B's $0 gain or loss taken into account and the recomputed gain or loss.
(C)
Acceleration of S's intercompany items.
Under the acceleration rule of paragraph (d) of this section, S's $30 gain is taken into account in computing consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) immediately before the effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced. Because the effect cannot be produced once S becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into account in Year 3 immediately before becoming a nonmember. S's gain is reflected under § 1.1502-32 in P's basis in the S stock immediately before P's sale of the stock. Under § 1.1502-32, P's basis in the S stock is increased by $30, and therefore P's gain is reduced (or loss is increased) by $18 (60% of $30).
See also
§§ 1.1502-33 and 1.1502-76(b). (The results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)
(D)
B's corresponding items.
Notwithstanding the acceleration of S's gain, B continues to take its corresponding items into account under its accounting method. Thus, B's items from the land are taken into account based on subsequent events (for example, its sale of the land).
(E)
Sale of B's stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that P sells 60% of B's stock (rather than S stock) to X for $60 and, as a result, B becomes a nonmember. Because the effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced once B becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 gain into account under the acceleration rule immediately before B becomes a nonmember. (The results would be the same if S sold the land to B in an installment sale to which section 453 would otherwise apply, because S must take its intercompany gain into account under this section.)
(F)
Discontinue filing consolidated returns.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the P group receives permission under § 1.1502-75(c) to discontinue filing consolidated returns beginning in Year 3. Under the acceleration rule, S takes its $30 gain into account on December 31 of Year 2.
(G)
No subgroups.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that P simultaneously sells all of the stock of both S and B to X (rather than 60% of S's stock), and S and B become members of the X consolidated group. Because the effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation in the P group cannot be produced once S and B become nonmembers, S takes its $30 gain into account under the acceleration rule immediately before S and B become nonmembers. (Paragraph (j)(5) of this section does not apply to treat the X consolidated group as succeeding to the P group because the X group acquired only the stock of S and B.) However, so long as S and B continue to join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns, B continues to treat S and B as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the attributes of B's corresponding items from the land.
(ii)
Example 2. Becoming a nonmember—attributes
—(A)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land
to B for $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, and expends substantial resources over a two-year period subdividing, developing, and marketing the land. On July 1 of Year 3, before B has sold any of the land, P sells 60% of S's stock to X for $60 and, as a result, S becomes a nonmember.
(B)
Attributes.
Under the acceleration rule, the attributes of S's gain are redetermined under the principles of the matching rule as if B sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the land (because the land continues to be held within the group). Thus, whether S's gain is capital gain or ordinary income depends on the activities of both S and B. Because S and B no longer join with each other in the filing of consolidated returns, the attributes of B's corresponding items (for example, from its subsequent sale of the land) are redetermined under the principles of the matching rule as if the S division (but not the B division) were transferred by the single corporation to an unrelated person at the time of P's sale of the S stock. Thus, B continues to take into account the activities of S with respect to the land before the intercompany transaction.
(C)
Depreciable property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that the property sold by S to B is depreciable property. Section 1239 applies to treat all of S's gain as ordinary income because it is taken into account as a result of B's deemed sale of the property to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group (a related person within the meaning of section 1239(b)).
(iii)
Example 3. Selling member's disposition of installment note
—(A)
Facts.
S owns land with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B in exchange for B's $110 note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55 in Year 4 and $55 in Year 5. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells B's note to X for $110.
(B)
Timing.
S's intercompany gain is taken into account under this section, and not under the rules of section 453. Consequently, S's sale of B's note does not result in its intercompany gain from the land being taken into account (for example, under section 453B). The sale does not prevent S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items from being taken into account in determining the group's consolidated taxable income under the matching rule, and X does not reflect any aspect of the intercompany transaction (X has its own cost basis in the note). S will take the intercompany gain into account under the matching rule or acceleration rule based on subsequent events (for example, B's sale of the land).
See also
paragraph (g) of this section for additional rules applicable to B's note as an intercompany obligation.
(iv)
Example 4. Cancellation of debt and attribute reduction under section 108(b)
—(A)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $0. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. B also holds the land for investment. During Year 3, B is insolvent and B's nonmember creditors discharge $60 of B's indebtedness. Because of insolvency, B's $60 discharge is excluded from B's gross income under section 108(a), and B reduces the basis of the land by $60 under sections 108(b) and 1017.
(B)
Acceleration rule.
As a result of B's basis reduction under section 1017, $60 of S's intercompany gain will not be taken into account under the matching rule (because there is only a $40 difference between B's $40 basis in the land and the $0 basis the land would have if S and B were divisions of a single corporation). Accordingly, S takes $60 of its gain into account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. S's gain is long-term capital gain, determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section as if B sold the land to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group for $100 immediately before the basis reduction.
(C)
Purchase price adjustment.
Assume instead that S sells the land to B in exchange for B's $100 purchase money note, B remains solvent, and S subsequently agrees to discharge $60 of the note as a purchase price adjustment to which section 108(e)(5) applies. Under applicable principles of tax law, $60 of S's gain and $60 of B's basis in the land are eliminated and never taken into
account. Similarly, the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this section.
(v)
Example 5. Section 481
—(A)
Facts.
S operates several trades or businesses, including a manufacturing business. S receives permission to change its method of accounting for valuing inventory for its manufacturing business. S increases the basis of its ending inventory by $100, and the related $100 positive section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account ratably over six taxable years, beginning in Year 1. During Year 3, S sells all of the assets used in its manufacturing business to B at a gain. Immediately after the transfer, B does not use the same inventory valuation method as S. On a separate entity basis, S's sale results in an acceleration of the balance of the section 481(a) adjustment to Year 3.
(B)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the balance of S's section 481(a) adjustment accelerated to Year 3 is intercompany income. However, S's $100 basis increase before the intercompany transaction eliminates the related difference for this amount between B's corresponding items taken into account and the recomputed corresponding items in subsequent periods. Because the accelerated section 481(a) adjustment will not be taken into account in determining the group's consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) under the matching rule, the balance of S's section 481 adjustment is taken into account under the acceleration rule as ordinary income at the time of the intercompany transaction. (If S's sale had not resulted in accelerating S's section 481(a) adjustment on a separate entity basis, S would have no intercompany income to be taken into account under this section.)
(e)
Simplifying rules
—(1)
Dollar-value LIFO inventory methods
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (e)(1) applies if either S or B uses a dollar-value LIFO inventory method to account for intercompany transactions. Rather than applying the matching rule separately to each intercompany inventory transaction, this paragraph (e)(1) provides methods to apply an aggregate approach that is based on dollar-value LIFO inventory accounting. Any method selected under this paragraph (e)(1) must be applied consistently.
(ii)
B uses dollar-value LIFO
—(A)
In general.
If B uses a dollar-value LIFO inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory purchases, and includes all of its inventory costs incurred for a year in its cost of goods sold for the year (that is, B has no inventory increment for the year), S takes into account all of its intercompany inventory items for the year. If B does not include all of its inventory costs incurred for the year in its cost of goods sold for the year (that is, B has an inventory increment for the year), S does not take all of its intercompany inventory income or loss into account. The amount not taken into account is determined under either the increment averaging method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section or the increment valuation method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. Separate computations are made for each pool of B that receives intercompany purchases from S, and S's amount not taken into account is layered based on B's LIFO inventory layers.
(B)
Increment averaging method.
Under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B), the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany inventory income or loss multiplied by the ratio of the LIFO value of B's current-year costs of its layer of increment to B's total inventory costs incurred for the year under its LIFO inventory method. If B includes more than its inventory costs incurred during any subsequent year in its cost of goods sold (a decrement), S takes into account the intercompany inventory income or loss layers in the same manner and proportion as B takes into account its inventory decrements.
(C)
Increment valuation method.
Under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C), the amount not taken into account is the amount of S's intercompany inventory income or loss for the appropriate period multiplied by the ratio of the LIFO value of B's current-year costs of its layer of increment to B's total inventory costs incurred in the appropriate period under its LIFO inventory method. The principles of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section otherwise apply. The appropriate period is the period of B's
year used to determine its current-year costs.
(iii)
S uses dollar-value LIFO.
If S uses a dollar-value LIFO inventory method to account for its intercompany inventory sales, S may use any reasonable method of allocating its LIFO inventory costs to intercompany transactions. LIFO inventory costs include costs of prior layers if a decrement occurs. For example, a reasonable allocation of the most recent costs incurred during the consolidated return year can be used to compute S's intercompany inventory income or loss for the year if S has an inventory increment and uses the earliest acquisitions costs method, but S must apportion costs from the most recent appropriate layers of increment if an inventory decrement occurs for the year.
(iv)
Other reasonable methods.
S or B may use a method not specifically provided in this paragraph (e)(1) that is expected to reasonably take into account intercompany items and corresponding items from intercompany inventory transactions. However, if the method used results, for any year, in a cumulative amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account by S that significantly exceeds the cumulative amount that would not be taken into account under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, S must take into account for that year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess. The method is thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect the amount taken into account.
(v)
Examples.
The inventory rules of this paragraph (e)(1) are illustrated by the following examples.
(A)
Example 1. Increment averaging method
—(
1
)
Facts.
Both S and B use a double-extension, dollar-value LIFO inventory method, and both value inventory increments using the earliest acquisitions cost valuation method. During Year 2, S sells 25 units of product Q to B on January 15 at $10/unit. S sells another 25 units on April 15, on July 15, and on September 15, at $12/unit. S's earliest cost of product Q is $7.50/unit and S's most recent cost of product Q is $8.00/unit. Both S and B have an inventory increment for the year. B's total inventory costs incurred during Year 2 are $6,000 and the LIFO value of B's Year 2 layer of increment is $600.
(
2
)
Intercompany inventory income.
Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, S must use a reasonable method of allocating its LIFO inventory costs to intercompany transactions. Because S has an inventory increment for Year 2 and uses the earliest acquisitions cost method, a reasonable method of determining its intercompany cost of goods sold for product Q is to use its most recent costs. Thus, its intercompany cost of goods sold is $800 ($8.00 most recent cost, multiplied by 100 units sold to B), and its intercompany inventory income is $350 ($1,150 sales proceeds from B minus $800 cost).
(
3
)
Timing.
(
i
) Under the increment averaging method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, $35 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows: LIFO value of B's Year 2 layer of increment/B's total inventory costs for year 2, or $600/$6,000 = 10%. 10% × S's $350 intercompany inventory income = $35.
(
ii
) Thus, $315 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $35 not taken into account).
(
4
)
S incurs a decrement.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that in Year 2, S incurs a decrement equal to 50% of its Year 1 layer. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, S must reasonably allocate the LIFO cost of the decrement to the cost of goods sold to B to determine S's intercompany inventory income.
(
5
)
B incurs a decrement.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B incurs a decrement in Year 2. S must take into account the entire $350 of Year 2 intercompany inventory income because all 100 units of product Q are deemed sold by B in Year 2.
(B)
Example 2. Increment valuation method
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
). In addition, B's use of the earliest acquisition's cost method of valuing its increments results in B valuing its year-end inventory using costs incurred from January
through March. B's costs incurred during the year are: $1,428 in the period January through March; $1,498 in the period April through June; $1,524 in the period July through September; and $1,550 in the period October through December. S's intercompany inventory income for these periods is: $50 in the period January through March ((25 × $10)−(25 × $8)); $100 in the period April through June ((25 × $12)−(25 × $8)); $100 in the period July through September ((25 × $12)−(25 × $8)); and $100 in the period October through December ((25 × $12)−(25 × $8)).
(
2
)
Timing.
(
i
) Under the increment valuation method of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, $21 of S's $350 of intercompany inventory income is not taken into account in Year 2, computed as follows: LIFO value of B's Year 2 layer of increment/B's total inventory costs from January through March of Year 2, or $600/$1,428 = 42%. 42% × S's $50 intercompany inventory income for the period from January through March = $21.
(
ii
) Thus, $329 of S's intercompany inventory income is taken into account in Year 2 ($350 of total intercompany inventory income minus $21 not taken into account).
(
3
)
B incurs a subsequent decrement.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
). In addition, assume that in Year 3, B experiences a decrement in its pool that receives intercompany purchases from S. B's decrement equals 20% of the base-year costs for its Year 2 layer. The fact that B has incurred a decrement means that all of its inventory costs incurred for Year 3 are included in cost of goods sold. As a result, S takes into account its entire amount of intercompany inventory income from its Year 3 sales. In addition, S takes into account $4.20 of its Year 2 layer of intercompany inventory income not already taken into account (20% of $21).
(C)
Example 3. Other reasonable inventory methods
—(
1
)
Facts.
Both S and B use a dollar-value LIFO inventory method for their inventory transactions. During Year 1, S sells inventory to B and to X. Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, to compute its intercompany inventory income and the amount of this income not taken into account, S computes its intercompany inventory income using the transfer price of the inventory items less a FIFO cost for the goods, takes into account these items based on a FIFO cost flow assumption for B's corresponding items, and the LIFO methods used by S and B are ignored for these computations. These computations are comparable to the methods used by S and B for financial reporting purposes, and the book methods and results are used for tax purposes. S adjusts the amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account as required by section 263A.
(
2
)
Reasonable method.
The method used by S is a reasonable method under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section if the cumulative amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account by S is not significantly greater than the cumulative amount that would not be taken into account under the methods specifically described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If, for any year, the method results in a cumulative amount of intercompany inventory items not taken into account by S that significantly exceeds the cumulative amount that would not be taken into account under the methods specifically provided, S must take into account for that year the amount necessary to eliminate the excess. The method is thereafter applied with appropriate adjustments to reflect the amount taken into account (for example, to prevent the amount from being taken into account more than once).
(2)
Reserve accounting
—(i)
Banks and thrifts.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this section (deferral of items from an intercompany obligation), a member's addition to, or reduction of, a reserve for bad debts that is maintained under section 585 is taken into account on a separate entity basis. For example, if S makes a loan to a nonmember and subsequently sells the loan to B, any deduction for an addition to a bad debt reserve under section 585 and any recapture income (or reduced bad debt deductions) are taken into account on a separate entity basis rather than as intercompany items or corresponding items taken into account under this section. Any gain or loss of S from its sale of the loan to B
is taken into account under this section, however, to the extent it is not attributable to recapture of the reserve.
(ii)
Insurance companies
—(A)
Direct insurance.
If a member provides insurance to another member in an intercompany transaction, the transaction is taken into account by both members on a separate entity basis. For example, if one member provides life insurance coverage for another member with respect to its employees, the premiums, reserve increases and decreases, and death benefit payments are determined and taken into account by both members on a separate entity basis rather than taken into account under this section as intercompany items and corresponding items.
(B)
Reinsurance
—(
1
)
In general.
Paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to a reinsurance transaction that is an intercompany transaction. For example, if a member assumes all or a portion of the risk on an insurance contract written by another member, the amounts transferred as reinsurance premiums, expense allowances, benefit reimbursements, reimbursed policyholder dividends, experience rating adjustments, and other similar items are taken into account under the matching rule and the acceleration rule. For purposes of this section, the assuming company is treated as B and the ceding company is treated as S.
(
2
)
Reserves determined on a separate entity basis.
For purposes of determining the amount of a member's increase or decrease in reserves, the amount of any reserve item listed in section 807(c) or 832(b)(5) resulting from a reinsurance transaction that is an intercompany transaction is determined on a separate entity basis. But see section 845, under which the Commissioner may allocate between or among the members any items, recharacterize any such items, or make any other adjustments necessary to reflect the proper source and character of the separate taxable income of a member.
(3)
Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity basis
—(i)
General rule.
The common parent may request consent to take into account on a separate entity basis items from intercompany transactions other than intercompany transactions with respect to stock or obligations of members. Consent may be granted for all items, or for items from a class or classes of transactions. The consent is effective only if granted in writing by the Internal Revenue Service. Unless revoked with the written consent of the Internal Revenue Service, the separate entity treatment applies to all affected intercompany transactions in the consolidated return year for which consent is granted and in all subsequent consolidated return years. Consent under this paragraph (e)(3) does not apply for purposes of taking into account losses and deductions deferred under section 267(f).
(ii)
Time and manner for requesting consent.
The request for consent described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be made in the form of a ruling request. The request must be signed by the common parent, include any information required by the Internal Revenue Service, and be filed on or before the due date of the consolidated return (not including extensions of time) for the first consolidated return year to which the consent is to apply. The Internal Revenue Service may impose terms and conditions for granting consent. A copy of the consent must be attached to the group's consolidated returns (or amended returns) as required by the terms of the consent.
(iii)
Effect of consent on methods of accounting.
A consent for separate entity accounting under this paragraph (e)(3), and a revocation of that consent, may require changes in members' methods of accounting for intercompany transactions. Because the consent, or a revocation of the consent, is effective for all intercompany transactions occurring in the consolidated return year for which the consent or revocation is first effective, any change in method is effected on a cut-off basis. Section 446(e) consent is granted for any changes in methods of accounting for intercompany transactions that are necessary solely to conform a member's methods to a binding consent with respect to the group under this paragraph (e)(3) or the revocation of that consent, provided the changes are made in the first consolidated return year for which the
consent or revocation under this paragraph (e)(3) is effective. Therefore, section 446(e) consent must be separately requested under applicable administrative procedures if a member has failed to conform its practices to the separate entity accounting provided under this paragraph (e)(3) or the revocation of that treatment in the first consolidated return year for which the consent to use separate entity accounting or revocation of that consent is effective.
(iv)
Consent to treat intercompany transactions on a separate entity basis under prior law.
A group that has received consent that is in effect as of the first day of the first consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12, 1995 to treat certain intercompany transactions as provided in § 1.1502-13(c)(3) of the regulations (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995) will be considered to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner to take items from intercompany transactions into account on a separate entity basis as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. This treatment is applicable only to the items, class or classes of transactions for which consent was granted under prior law.
(f)
Stock of members
—(1)
In general.
In addition to the general rules of this section, the rules of this paragraph (f) apply to stock of members.
(2)
Intercompany distributions to which section 301 applies
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (f)(2) provides rules for intercompany transactions to which section 301 applies (intercompany distributions). For purposes of determining whether a distribution is an intercompany distribution, it is treated as occurring under the principles of the entitlement rule of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. A distribution is not an intercompany distribution to the extent it is deducted by the distributing member. See, for example, section 1382(c)(1).
(ii)
Distributee member.
An intercompany distribution is not included in the gross income of the distributee member (B). However, this exclusion applies to a distribution only to the extent there is a corresponding negative adjustment reflected under § 1.1502-32 in B's basis in the stock of the distributing member (S). For example, no amount is included in B's gross income under section 301(c)(3) from a distribution in excess of the basis of the stock of a subsidiary that results in an excess loss account under § 1.1502-32(a) which is treated as negative basis under § 1.1502-19. B's dividend received deduction under section 243(a)(3) is determined without regard to any intercompany distributions under this paragraph (f)(2) to the extent they are not included in gross income. See § 1.1502-26(b) (applicability of the dividends received deduction to distributions not excluded from gross income, such as a distribution from the common parent to a subsidiary owning stock of the common parent).
(iii)
Distributing member.
The principles of section 311(b) apply to S's loss, as well as gain, from an intercompany distribution of property. Thus, S's loss is taken into account under the matching rule if the property is subsequently sold to a nonmember. However, section 311(a) continues to apply to distributions to nonmembers (for example, loss is not recognized).
(iv)
Entitlement rule
—(A)
In general.
For all Federal income tax purposes, an intercompany distribution is treated as taken into account when the shareholding member becomes entitled to it (generally on the record date). For example, if B becomes entitled to a cash distribution before it is made, the distribution is treated as made when B becomes entitled to it. For this purpose, B is treated as entitled to a distribution no later than the time the distribution is taken into account under the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., under section 305(c)). To the extent a distribution is not made, appropriate adjustments must be made as of the date it was taken into account.
(B)
Nonmember shareholders.
If nonmembers own stock of the distributing corporation at the time the distribution is treated as occurring under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), appropriate adjustments must be made to prevent the acceleration of the distribution to members from affecting distributions to nonmembers.
(3)
Boot in an intercompany reorganization
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (f)(3)
provides additional rules for an intercompany transaction in which the receipt of money or other property (nonqualifying property) results in the application of section 356. For example, the distribution of stock of a lower-tier member to a higher-tier member in an intercompany transaction to which section 355 would apply but for the receipt of nonqualifying property is a transaction to which this paragraph (f)(3) applies. This paragraph (f)(3) does not apply if a party to the transaction becomes a member or nonmember as part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, if S merges into a nonmember in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A), this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply.
(ii)
Treatment.
Nonqualifying property received as part of a transaction described in this paragraph (f)(3) is treated as received by the member shareholder in a separate transaction. See, for example, sections 302 and 311 (rather than sections 356 and 361). The nonqualifying property is treated as taken into account immediately after the transaction if section 354 would apply but for the fact that nonqualifying property is received. It is treated as taken into account immediately before the transaction if section 355 would apply but for the fact that nonqualifying property is received. The treatment under this paragraph (f)(3)(ii) applies for all Federal income tax purposes.
(4)
Acquisition by issuer of its own stock.
If a member acquires its own stock, or an option to buy or sell its own stock, in an intercompany transaction, the member's basis in that stock or option is treated as eliminated for all purposes. Accordingly, S's intercompany items from the stock or options of B are taken into account under this section if B acquires the stock or options in an intercompany transaction (unless, for example, B acquires the stock in exchange for successor property within the meaning of paragraph (j)(1) of this section in a nonrecognition transaction). For example, if B redeems its stock from S in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies, S's gain from the transaction is taken into account immediately under the acceleration rule.
(5)
Certain liquidations and distributions
—(i)
Netting allowed.
S's intercompany item from a transfer to B of the stock of another corporation (T) is taken into account under this section in certain circumstances even though the T stock is never held by a nonmember after the intercompany transaction. For example, if S sells all of T's stock to B at a gain, and T subsequently liquidates into B in a separate transaction to which section 332 applies, S's gain is taken into account under the matching rule. Under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, S's intercompany gain taken into account as a result of a liquidation under section 332 or a comparable nonrecognition transaction is not redetermined to be excluded from gross income. Under this paragraph (f)(5)(i), if S has both intercompany income or gain and intercompany deduction or loss attributable to stock of the same corporation having the same material terms, only the income or gain in excess of the deduction or loss is subject to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. This paragraph (f)(5)(i) applies only to a transaction in which B's basis in its T stock is permanently eliminated in a liquidation under section 332 or any comparable nonrecognition transaction, including—
(A) A merger of B into T under section 368(a);
(B) A distribution by B of its T stock in a transaction described in section 355; or
(C) A deemed liquidation of T resulting from an election under section 338(h)(10).
(ii)
Elective relief
—(A)
In general.
If an election is made pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), certain transactions are recharacterized to prevent S's items from being taken into account or to provide offsets to those items. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii) applies only if T is a member throughout the period beginning with S's transfer and ending with the completion of the nonrecognition transaction.
(B)
Section 332
—(
1
)
In general.
If section 332 would otherwise apply to T's (old T's) liquidation into B, and B transfers substantially all of old T's assets to a new member (new T), and if a direct transfer of substantially all of
old T's assets to new T would qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a), then, for all Federal income tax purposes, T's liquidation into B and B's transfer of substantially all of old T's assets to new T will be disregarded and instead, the transaction will be treated as if old T transferred substantially all of its assets to new T in exchange for new T stock and the assumption of T's liabilities in a reorganization described in section 368(a). (Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, B's stock in new T would be a successor asset to B's stock in old T, and S's gain would be taken into account based on the new T stock.)
(
2
)
Time limitation and adjustments.
The transfer of old T's assets to new T qualifies under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section only if B has entered into a written plan, on or before the due date of the group's consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year that includes the date of old T's liquidation, to transfer the old T assets to new T, and the statement described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section is included on or with a timely filed consolidated income tax return (including extensions) for the tax year that includes the date of the liquidation. The transfer of substantially all of T's assets to new T must be completed within 12 months of the filing of the return. Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect any events occurring before the formation of new T and to reflect any assets not transferred to new T, or liabilities not assumed by new T. For example, if B retains an asset of old T, the asset is treated under paragraph (f)(3) of this section as acquired by new T but distributed to B immediately after the reorganization.
(C)
Sections 338(h)(10) and 336(e).
— (
1
)
In general.
This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) applies to a deemed liquidation of T under section 332 as the result of an election under section 338(h)(10) or section 336(e). This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) does not apply if paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section is applied to the deemed liquidation. Under this paragraph, B is treated with respect to each share of its T stock as recognizing as a corresponding item any loss or deduction it would recognize (determined after adjusting stock basis under § 1.1502-32) if section 331 applied to the deemed liquidation. For all other Federal income tax purposes, the deemed liquidation remains subject to section 332.
(
2
)
Limitation on amount of loss.
The amount of B's loss or deduction under this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) is limited as follows—
(
i
) The aggregate amount of loss recognized with respect to T stock cannot exceed the amount of S's intercompany income or gain that is in excess of S's intercompany deduction or loss with respect to shares of T stock having the same material terms as the shares giving rise to S's intercompany income or gain; and
(
ii
) The aggregate amount of loss recognized under this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) from T's deemed liquidation cannot exceed the net amount of deduction or loss (if any) that would be taken into account from the deemed liquidation if section 331 applied with respect to all T shares.
(
3
)
Asset sale, etc.
The principles of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) apply, with appropriate adjustments, if T transfers all of its assets to a nonmember and completely liquidates in a transaction comparable to the section 338(h)(10) transaction described in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section. For example, if S sells all of T's stock to B at a gain followed by T's merger into a nonmember in exchange for a cash payment to B in a transaction treated for Federal income tax purposes as T's sale of its assets to the nonmember and complete liquidation, the merger is ordinarily treated as a comparable transaction.
(D)
Section 355.
If B distributes the T stock in an intercompany transaction to which section 355 applies (including an intercompany transaction to which 355 applies because of the application of paragraph (f)(3) of this section), the redetermination of the basis of the T stock under section 358 could cause S's gain or loss to be taken into account under this section. This paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(D) applies to treat B's distribution as subject to sections 301 and 311 (as modified by this paragraph (f)), rather than section 355. The election will prevent S's gain or loss from being taken into account immediately to the
extent matching remains possible, but B's gain or loss from the distribution will also be taken into account under this section.
(E)
Election.
An election to apply paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section is made in a separate statement entitled, “[INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF COMMON PARENT] HEREBY ELECTS THE APPLICATION OF § 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii) FOR AN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF S] AND [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF T].” A separate election must be made for each such application. The election must be filed by including the statement on or with the consolidated group's income tax return for the year of T's liquidation (or other transaction). The Commissioner may impose reasonable terms and conditions to the application of paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section that are consistent with the purposes of such section. The statement must—
(
1
) Identify S's intercompany transaction and T's liquidation (or other transaction); and
(
2
) Specify which provision of paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section applies and how it alters the otherwise applicable results under this section (including, for example, the amount of S's intercompany items and the amount deferred or offset as a result of paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section).
(F)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (f)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section apply to transactions in which old T's liquidation into B occurs on or after October 25, 2007.
(6)
Stock of common parent.
In addition to the general rules of this section, this paragraph (f)(6) applies to parent stock (P stock) and positions in P stock held or entered into by another member. For this purpose, P stock is any stock of the common parent held (directly or indirectly) by another member or any stock of a member (the issuer) that was the common parent if the stock was held (directly or indirectly) by another member while the issuer was the common parent.
(i)
Loss stock
—(A)
Recognized loss.
Any loss recognized, directly or indirectly, by a member with respect to P stock is permanently disallowed and does not reduce earnings and profits. See § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(A) for a corresponding reduction in the basis of the member's stock.
(B)
Other cases.
If a member, M, owns P stock, the stock is subsequently owned by a nonmember, and, immediately before the stock is owned by the nonmember, M's basis in the share exceeds its fair market value, then, to the extent paragraph (f)(6)(i)(A) of this section does not apply, M's basis in the share is reduced to the share's fair market value immediately before the share is held by the nonmember. For example, if M owns shares of P stock with a $100x basis and M becomes a nonmember at a time when the P shares have a value of $60x, M's basis in the P shares is reduced to $60x immediately before M becomes a nonmember. Similarly, if M contributes the P stock to a nonmember in a transaction subject to section 351, M's basis in the shares is reduced to $60x immediately before the contribution. See § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(B) for a corresponding reduction in the basis of M's stock.
(C)
Waiver of built-in loss on P stock
—(
1
)
In general.
If a nonmember that owns P stock with a basis in excess of its fair market value becomes a member of the P consolidated group in a qualifying cost basis transaction, the group may make an irrevocable election to reduce the basis of the P stock to its fair market value immediately before the nonmember becomes a member of the P group. If the nonmember was a member of another consolidated group immediately before becoming a member of the P group, the reduction in basis is treated as occurring immediately after it ceases to be a member of the prior group. A qualifying cost basis transaction is the purchase (i.e., a transaction in which basis is determined under section 1012) by members of the P consolidated group (while they are members) in a 12-month period of an amount of the nonmember's stock satisfying the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).
(
2
)
Election.
The election described in paragraph (f)(6)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section must be made in a separate statement
entitled, “ELECTION TO REDUCE BASIS OF P STOCK UNDER § 1.1502-13(f)(6) HELD BY [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF MEMBER WHOSE BASIS IN P STOCK IS REDUCED].” The election must be filed by including the statement on or with the consolidated group's income tax return for the year in which the nonmember becomes a member. The statement must identify the member's basis in the P stock (taking into account the effect of this election) and the number of shares of P stock held by the member.
(ii)
Gain stock.
For dispositions of P stock,
see
§ 1.1032-3.
(iii)
Mark-to-market of P stock.
Paragraphs (f)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not apply to any gain or loss from a share of P stock held by a member, M, if—
(A) M regularly trades in P stock (of the same class) with customers in the ordinary course of its business as a dealer;
(B) The gain or loss on the share is taken into account by M pursuant to section 475(a);
(C) M's basis in the share is not adjusted by reference to the basis of any other property or by reference to income, gain, deduction, or loss from other property; and
(D) Neither M nor any other member of the group has structured or engaged in any transaction while a member (or in anticipation of becoming a member), during the taxable year or in any year within the preceding five taxable years that is open for assessment under section 6501, with a principal purpose of avoiding gain or creating loss on P stock subject to section 475(a).
(iv)
Options, warrants, and other positions
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (f)(6) applies with appropriate adjustments to positions in P stock to the extent that P's gain or loss from an equivalent position would not be recognized under section 1032. Thus, if M purchases an option to buy or sell P stock and sells the option at a loss, the loss is permanently disallowed under paragraph (f)(6)(i)(A) of this section. Similarly, if M is the grantor of such an option and becomes a nonmember, then the principles of paragraph (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section apply to the extent that M would recognize loss from cash settlement of the option at its fair market value immediately before M becomes a nonmember, and proper adjustments must be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized from the position by M. If P grants M an option to acquire P stock in a transaction meeting the requirements of § 1.1032-3, M is treated as having purchased the option from P for fair market value with cash contributed to M by P.
(B)
Mark-to-market of positions in P stock.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section, gain or loss with respect to a position taken into account under section 1256(a) is treated as taken into account under section 475(a) to the extent that the gain or loss would be taken into account under the principles of section 475.
(v)
Applicability date.
This paragraph (f)(6) applies to gain or loss taken into account on or after July 12, 1995, and to transactions occurring on or after July 12, 1995.
(7)
Examples—In general.
The application of this section to intercompany transactions with respect to stock of members is illustrated by the following examples.
(i)
Example 1. Dividend exclusion and property distribution
—(A)
Facts.
S owns land with a $70 basis and $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, P's basis in S's stock is $100. During Year 1, S declares and makes a dividend distribution of the land to P. Under section 311(b), S has a $30 gain. Under section 301(d), P's basis in the land is $100. On July 1 of Year 3, P sells the land to X for $110.
(B)
Dividend elimination and stock basis adjustments.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's distribution to P is an intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross income. Under § 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is reduced from $100 to $0 in Year 1.
(C)
Matching rule and stock basis adjustments.
Under the matching rule (treating P as the buying member and S as the selling member), S takes its $30 gain into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between P's $10 gain taken into account and the $40 recomputed gain. Under § 1.1502-32, P's
basis in S's stock is increased from $0 to $30 in Year 3.
(D)
Loss property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that S has a $130 (rather than $70) basis in the land. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the principles of section 311(b) apply to S's loss from the intercompany distribution. Thus, S has a $30 loss that is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference between P's $10 gain taken into account and the $20 recomputed loss. (The results are the same under section 267(f).) Under § 1.1502-32, P's basis in S's stock is reduced from $100 to $0 in Year 1, and from $0 to a $30 excess loss account in Year 3. (If P had distributed the land to its shareholders, rather than selling the land to X, P would take its $10 gain under section 311(b) into account, and S would take its $30 loss into account under the matching rule with $10 offset by P's gain and $20 recharacterized as a noncapital, nondeductible amount.)
(E)
Entitlement rule.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, after P becomes entitled to the distribution but before the distribution is made, S issues additional stock to the public and becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the determination of whether a distribution is an intercompany distribution is made under the entitlement rule of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section. Treating S's distribution as made when P becomes entitled to it results in the distribution being an intercompany distribution. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the distribution is not included in P's gross income. S's $30 gain from the distribution is intercompany gain that is taken into account under the acceleration rule immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus, there is a net $70 decrease in P's basis in its S stock under § 1.1502-32 ($100 decrease for the distribution and a $30 increase for S's $30 gain). Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, P does not take the distribution into account again under separate return rules when received, and P is not entitled to a dividends received deduction.
(ii)
Example 2. Excess loss accounts
—(A)
Facts.
S owns all of T's only class of stock with a $10 basis and $100 value. S has substantial earnings and profits, and T has $10 of earnings and profits. On January 1 of Year 1, S declares and distributes a dividend of all of the T stock to P. Under section 311(b), S has a $90 gain. Under section 301(d), P's basis in the T stock is $100. During Year 3, T borrows $90 and declares and makes a $90 distribution to P to which section 301 applies, and P's basis in the T stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32 from $100 to $10. During Year 6, T has $5 of earnings that increase P's basis in the T stock under § 1.1502-32 from $10 to $15. On December 1 of Year 9, T issues additional stock to X and, as a result, T becomes a nonmember.
(B)
Dividend exclusion.
Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, P's $100 of dividend income from S's distribution of the T stock, and its $10 of dividend income from T's $90 distribution, are not included in gross income.
(C)
Matching and acceleration rules.
Under § 1.1502-19(b)(1), when T becomes a nonmember P must include in income the amount of its excess loss account (if any) in T stock. P has no excess loss account in the T stock. Therefore P's corresponding item from the deconsolidation of T is $0. Treating S and P as divisions of a single corporation, the T stock would continue to have a $10 basis after the distribution, and the adjustments under § 1.1502-32 for T's $90 distribution and $5 of earnings would result in a $75 excess loss account. Thus, the recomputed corresponding item from the deconsolidation is $75. Under the matching rule, S takes $75 of its $90 gain into account in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a nonmember, to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain taken into account and the $75 recomputed gain. S's remaining $15 of gain is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events (for example, under the matching rule if P subsequently sells its T stock, or under the acceleration rule if S becomes a nonmember).
(D)
Reverse sequence.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that T
borrows $90 and makes its $90 distribution to S before S distributes T's stock to P. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, T's $90 distribution to S ($10 of which is a dividend) is not included in S's gross income. The corresponding negative adjustment under § 1.1502-32 reduces S's basis in the T stock from $10 to an $80 excess loss account. Under section 311(b), S has a $90 gain from the distribution of T stock to P. Under section 301(d) P's initial basis in the T stock is $10 (the stock's fair market value), and the basis increases to $15 under § 1.1502-32 as a result of T's earnings in Year 6. The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(C) of this section (
Example 2
). Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.
(E)
Partial stock sale.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that P sells 10% of T's stock to X on December 1 of Year 9 for $1.50 (rather than T's issuing additional stock and becoming a nonmember). Under the matching rule, S takes $9 of its gain into account to reflect the difference between P's $0 gain taken into account ($1.50 sale proceeds minus $1.50 basis) and the $9 recomputed gain ($1.50 sale proceeds plus $7.50 excess loss account).
(F)
Loss, rather than cash distribution.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that T retains the loan proceeds and incurs a $90 loss in Year 3 that is absorbed by the group. The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(C) of this section (
Example 2
). Under § 1.1502-32, the loss in Year 3 reduces P's basis in the T stock from $100 to $10, and T's $5 of earnings in Year 6 increase the basis to $15. Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events. (The timing and attributes of S's gain would be determined in the same manner provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(D) of this section (
Example 2
) if T incurred the $90 loss before S's distribution of the T stock to P.)
(G)
Stock sale, rather than stock distribution.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that S sells the T stock to P for $100 (rather than distributing the stock). The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the same manner provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(C) of this section (
Example 2
). Thus, $75 of S's gain is taken into account under the matching rule in Year 9 as a result of T becoming a nonmember, and the remaining $15 is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events.
(iii)
Example 3. Intercompany reorganization
—(A)
Facts.
P forms S and B by contributing $200 to the capital of each. During Years 1 through 4, S and B each earn $50, and under § 1.1502-32 P adjusts its basis in the stock of each to $250. (
See
§ 1.1502-33 for adjustments to earnings and profits.) On January 1 of Year 5, the fair market value of S's assets and its stock is $500, and S merges into B in a tax-free reorganization. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, P receives B stock with a fair market value of $350 and $150 of cash.
(B)
Treatment as a section 301 distribution.
The merger of S into B is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies. P is treated as receiving additional B stock with a fair market value of $500 and, under section 358, a basis of $250. Immediately after the merger, $150 of the stock received is treated as redeemed, and the redemption is treated under section 302(d) as a distribution to which section 301 applies. Because the $150 distribution is treated as not received as part of the merger, section 356 does not apply and no basis adjustments are required under section 358(a)(1)(A) and (B). Because B is treated under section 381(c)(2) as receiving S's earnings and profits and the redemption is treated as occurring after the merger, $100 of the distribution is treated as a dividend under section 301 and P's basis in the B stock is reduced correspondingly
under § 1.1502-32. The remaining $50 of the distribution reduces P's basis in the B stock. Section 301(c)(2) and § 1.1502-32. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, P's $100 of dividend income is not included in gross income. Under § 1.302-2(c), proper adjustments are made to P's basis in its B stock to reflect its basis in the B stock redeemed, with the result that P's basis in the B stock is reduced by the entire $150 distribution.
(C)
Depreciated property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(A) of this section (
Example 3
), except that property of S with a $200 basis and $150 fair market value is distributed to P (rather than cash of B). As in paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(B) of this section (
Example 3
), P is treated as receiving additional B stock in the merger and a $150 distribution to which section 301 applies immediately after the merger. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the principles of section 311(b) apply to B's $50 loss and the loss is taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules based on subsequent events (for example, under the matching rule if P subsequently sells the property, or under the acceleration rule if B becomes a nonmember). The results are the same under section 267(f).
(D)
Divisive transaction.
Assume instead that, pursuant to a plan, S distributes the stock of a lower-tier subsidiary in a spin-off transaction to which section 355 applies together with $150 of cash. The distribution of stock is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies. P is treated as receiving the $150 of cash immediately before the section 355 distribution, as a distribution to which section 301 applies. Section 356(b) does not apply and no basis adjustments are required under section 358(a)(1) (A) and (B). Because the $150 distribution is treated as made before the section 355 distribution, the distribution reduces P's basis in the S stock under § 1.1502-32, and the basis allocated under section 358(c) between the S stock and the lower-tier subsidiary stock received reflects this basis reduction.
(iv)
Example 4. All cash intercompany reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D)
—(A)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of M and B. M owns all of the stock of S with a basis of $25. On January 1 of Year 2, the fair market value of S's assets and its stock is $100, and S sells all of its assets to B for $100 cash and liquidates. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D). Pursuant to § 1.368-2(l), B will be deemed to issue a nominal share of B stock to S in addition to the $100 of cash actually exchanged for the S assets, and S will be deemed to distribute all of the consideration to M. M will be deemed to distribute the nominal share of B stock to P.
(B)
Treatment as a section 301 distribution.
The sale of S's assets to B is a transaction to which paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies. In addition to the nominal share issued by B to S under § 1.368-2(l), S is treated as receiving additional B stock with a fair market value of $100 (in lieu of the $100) and, under section 358, a basis of $25 which S distributes to M in liquidation. Immediately after the sale, the B stock (with the exception of the nominal share which is still held by M) received by M is treated as redeemed for $100, and the redemption is treated under section 302(d) as a distribution to which section 301 applies. M's basis of $25 in the B stock is reduced under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(v), resulting in an excess loss account of $75 in the nominal share. (
See
§ 1.302-2(c)). M's deemed distribution of the nominal share of B stock to P under § 1.368-2(l) will result in M generating an intercompany gain under section 311(b) of $75, to be subsequently taken into account under the matching and acceleration rules.
(v)
Example 5. Stock redemptions and distributions
—(A)
Facts.
Before becoming a member of the P group, S owns P stock with a $30 basis. On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. On July 1 of Year 3, P redeems the P stock held by S for $100 in a transaction to which section 302(a) applies.
(B)
Gain under section 302.
Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, P's basis in the P stock acquired from S is treated as eliminated. As a result of this elimination, S's intercompany item will never be taken into account under the matching rule because P's basis in the
stock does not reflect S's intercompany item. Therefore, S's $70 gain is taken into account under the acceleration rule in Year 3. The attributes of S's item are determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section by applying the matching rule as if P had sold the stock to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group at no gain or loss. Although P's corresponding item from a sale of its stock would have been excluded from gross income under section 1032, paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section prevents S's gain from being treated as excluded from gross income; instead S's gain is capital gain.
(C)
Gain under section 311.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(v)(A) of this section (
Example 5
), except that S distributes the P stock to P in a transaction to which section 301 applies (rather than the stock being redeemed), and S has a $70 gain under section 311(b). The timing and attributes of S's gain are determined in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(7)(v)(B) of this section (
Example 5
).
(D)
Loss stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(v)(A) of this section (
Example 5
), except that S has a $130 (rather than $30) basis in the P stock and has a $30 loss under section 302(a). The limitation under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to intercompany losses. Thus, S's loss is taken into account in Year 3 as a noncapital, nondeductible amount.
(vi)
Example 6. Intercompany stock sale followed by section 332 liquidation
—(A)
Facts.
S owns all of the stock of T, with a $70 basis and $100 value, and T's assets have a $10 basis and $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to B for $100. On July 1 of Year 3, when T's assets are still worth $100, T distributes all of its assets to B in an unrelated complete liquidation to which section 332 applies.
(B)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, B's unrecognized gain or loss under section 332 is a corresponding item for purposes of applying the matching rule. In Year 3 when T liquidates, B has $0 of unrecognized gain or loss under section 332 because B has a $100 basis in the T stock and receives a $100 distribution with respect to its T stock. Treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would have been $30 of unrecognized gain under section 332 because B would have succeeded to S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under the matching rule, S's $30 intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 3 as a result of T's liquidation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the attributes of S's gain and B's corresponding item are redetermined as if S and B were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain ordinarily would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross income to reflect the nonrecognition of B's gain under section 332, S's gain remains capital gain because B's unrecognized gain under section 332 is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code.
See
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. However, relief may be elected under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Intercompany sale at a loss.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(vi)(A) of this section (
Example 6
), except that S has a $130 (rather than $70) basis in the T stock. The limitation under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to intercompany losses. Thus, S's intercompany loss is taken into account in Year 3 as a noncapital, nondeductible amount. However, relief may be elected under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
(vii)
Example 7. Intercompany stock sale followed by section 355 distribution
—(A)
Facts.
S owns all of the stock of T with a $70 basis and a $100 value. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells all of T's stock to M for $100. On June 1 of Year 6, M distributes all of its T stock to its nonmember shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies. At the time of the distribution, M has a basis in T stock of $100 and T has a value of $150.
(B)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, M's $50 gain not recognized on the distribution under section 355 is a corresponding item. Treating S and M as divisions of a single corporation, the recomputed corresponding item would be $80 of unrecognized gain under section 355 because M would have succeeded to S's $70 basis in the T stock. Thus, under
the matching rule, S's $30 intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 6 as a result of the distribution. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the attributes of S's intercompany item and M's corresponding item are redetermined to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if S and M were divisions of a single corporation. Although S's gain ordinarily would be redetermined to be treated as excluded from gross income to reflect the nonrecognition of M's gain under section 355(c), S's gain remains capital gain because M's unrecognized gain under section 355(c) is not permanently and explicitly disallowed under the Code.
See
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. Because M's distribution of the T stock is not an intercompany transaction, relief is not available under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Section 355 distribution within the group.
The facts are the same as under paragraph (f)(7)(vii)(A) of this section (
Example 7
), except that M distributes the T stock to B (another member of the group), and B takes a $75 basis in the T stock under section 358. Under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, B is a successor to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany gain into account, and therefore both M and B might have corresponding items with respect to S's intercompany gain. To the extent it is possible, matching with respect to B's corresponding items produces the result most consistent with treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation.
See
paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(4) of this section. However, because there is only $5 difference between B's $75 basis in the T stock and the $70 basis the stock would have if S, M, and B were divisions of a single corporation, only $5 can be taken into account under the matching rule with respect to B's corresponding items. (This $5 is taken into account with respect to B's corresponding items based on subsequent events.) The remaining $25 of S's $30 intercompany gain is taken into account in Year 6 under the matching rule with respect to M's corresponding item from its distribution of the T stock. The attributes of S's remaining $25 of gain are determined in the same manner as in paragraph (f)(7)(vii)(B) of this section (
Example 7
).
(D)
Relief elected.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(7)(vii)(C) of this section (
Example 7
) except that P elects relief pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. As a result of the election, M's distribution of the T stock is treated as subject to sections 301 and 311 instead of section 355. Accordingly, M recognizes $50 of intercompany gain from the distribution, B takes a basis in the stock equal to its fair market value of $150, and S and M take their intercompany gains into account with respect to B's corresponding items based on subsequent events. (None of S's gain is taken into account in Year 6 as a result of M's distribution of the T stock.)
(g)
Obligations of members
—(1)
In general.
In addition to the general rules of this section, the rules of this paragraph (g) apply to intercompany obligations.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply—
(i)
Obligation of a member
is a debt or security of a member.
(A)
Debt of a member
is any obligation of the member constituting indebtedness under general principles of Federal income tax law (for example, under nonstatutory authorities, or under section 108, section 163, or § 1.1275-1(d)), but not an executory obligation to purchase or provide goods or services.
(B)
Security of a member
is any security of the member described in section 475(c)(2)(D) or (E), and any commodity of the member described in section 475(e)(2)(A), (B), or (C), but not if the security or commodity is a position with respect to the member's stock. See paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(6) of this section for special rules applicable to positions with respect to a member's stock.
(ii)
Intercompany obligation
is an obligation between members, but only for the period during which both parties are members.
(iii)
Intercompany obligation subgroup
is comprised of two or more members that include the creditor and debtor on an intercompany obligation if the creditor and debtor bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to each
other through an intercompany obligation subgroup parent.
(iv)
Intercompany obligation subgroup parent
is the corporation (including either the creditor or debtor) that bears the same relationship to the other members of the intercompany obligation subgroup as a common parent bears to the members of a consolidated group. Any reference to an intercompany obligation subgroup parent includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor. For this purpose, a predecessor is a transferor of assets to a transferee (the successor) in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.
(v)
Tax benefit
is the benefit of, for Federal tax purposes, a net reduction in income or gain, or a net increase in loss, deduction, credit, or allowance. A tax benefit includes, but is not limited to, the use of a built-in item or items from an intercompany obligation to reduce gain or increase loss on the sale of member stock, or to create or absorb a tax attribute of a member or subgroup.
(vi)
Eighty-percent chain
is a chain of two or more corporations in which stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) of each lower-tier member is held directly by a higher-tier member of such chain.
(3)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance of intercompany obligations in triggering transactions
—(i)
Scope
—(A)
Triggering transactions.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3), a triggering transaction includes the following:
(
1
)
Assignment and extinguishment transactions.
Any intercompany transaction in which a member realizes an amount, directly or indirectly, from the assignment or extinguishment of all or part of its remaining rights or obligations under an intercompany obligation or any comparable transaction in which a member realizes any such amount, directly or indirectly, from an intercompany obligation (for example, a mark to fair market value of an obligation or a bad debt deduction). However, a reduction of the basis of an intercompany obligation pursuant to § 1.1502-36(d) (attribute reduction to prevent duplication of loss), or pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 (basis reductions upon the exclusion from gross income of discharge of indebtedness) or any other provision that adjusts the basis of an intercompany obligation as a substitute for income, gain, deduction, or loss, is not a comparable transaction.
(
2
)
Outbound transactions.
Any transaction in which an intercompany obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation.
(B)
Exceptions.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section, a transaction is not a triggering transaction as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section if any of the exceptions in this paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) apply. In making this determination, if a creditor or debtor realizes an amount in a transaction in which a creditor assigns all or part of its rights under an intercompany obligation to the debtor, or a debtor assigns all or part of its obligations under an intercompany obligation to the creditor, the transaction will be treated as an extinguishment and will be excepted from the definition of “triggering transaction” only if either of the exceptions in paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B)(
5
) or (
6
) of this section apply. The exceptions are as follows.
(
1
)
Intercompany section 361, 332, or 351 exchange.
The transaction is an intercompany exchange to which section 361(a), sections 332 and 337(a), or (except as provided in the following sentence) section 351 applies in which no amount of income, gain, deduction or loss is recognized by the creditor or debtor. The assignment of an intercompany obligation by a creditor member in an intercompany exchange to which section 351 applies is a triggering transaction, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a member of the group is described in, or engages in a transaction that is described in, any of the following paragraphs.
(
i
) The transferor or transferee member has a loss subject to a limitation (for example, a loss from a separate return limitation year that is subject to limitation under § 1.1502-21(c), or a dual consolidated loss that is subject to limitation under § 1.1503(d)-4), but only if the other member is not subject to a comparable limitation;
(
ii
) The transferor or transferee member has a special status within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(c)(5) (for example, a bank defined in section 581, or a
life insurance company subject to tax under section 801) that the other member does not also possess;
(
iii
) A member of the group realizes discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) within the same taxable year as that of the exchange, and the tax attributes attributable to either the transferor or the transferee member are reduced under sections 108, 1017, and § 1.1502-28 (except if the attribute reduction results solely from the application of § 1.1502-28(a)(4) (reduction of certain tax attributes attributable to other members));
(
iv
) The transferee member has a nonmember shareholder;
(
v
) The transferee member issues preferred stock to the transferor member in exchange for the assignment of the intercompany obligation; or
(
vi
) The stock of the transferee member (or a higher-tier member other than a higher-tier member of an 80-percent chain that includes the transferor and transferee) is disposed of within 12 months from the assignment of the intercompany obligation, unless at the time of the assignment, the transferor member, transferee member (or in the case of successive section 351 exchanges, each transferor and transferee member) and the debtor member are all in the same 80-percent chain; and all of the stock of the transferee (or in the case of successive section 351 exchanges, the lowest-tier transferee) held by members of the group is disposed of as part of the same plan or arrangement, either directly or indirectly, to persons that are not members of the group.
(
2
)
Intercompany assumption transaction.
All of the debtor's obligations under an intercompany obligation are assumed in connection with the debtor's sale or other disposition of property (other than solely money) in an intercompany transaction in which gain or loss is recognized under section 1001.
(
3
)
Exception to the application of section 108(e)(4).
The obligation became an intercompany obligation by reason of an event described in § 1.108-2(e)(2) (exception to the application of section 108(e)(4) in the case of acquisitions by securities dealers).
(
4
)
Reserve accounting.
The amount realized is from reserve accounting under section 585 (see paragraph (g)(4)(v) of this section for special rules).
(
5
)
Intercompany extinguishment transaction.
All or part of the rights and obligations under the intercompany obligation are extinguished in an intercompany transaction (other than an exchange or deemed exchange of an intercompany obligation for a newly issued intercompany obligation), the adjusted issue price of the obligation is equal to the creditor's basis in the obligation, and the debtor's corresponding item and the creditor's intercompany item (after taking into account the special rules of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section) with respect to the obligation offset in amount.
(
6
)
Routine modification of intercompany obligation.
All of the rights and obligations under the intercompany obligation are extinguished in an intercompany transaction that is an exchange (or deemed exchange) for a newly issued intercompany obligation, and the issue price of the newly issued obligation equals both the adjusted issue price of the extinguished obligation and the creditor's basis in the extinguished obligation. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, a newly issued intercompany obligation includes an obligation that is issued (or deemed issued) by a member other than the original debtor if such other member assumes the original debtor's obligations under the original obligation in a transaction that is described in either paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) or (g)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section and the assumption results in a significant modification of the original obligation under § 1.1001-3(e)(4) and a deemed exchange under § 1.1001-3(b).
(
7
)
Outbound distribution of newly issued intercompany obligation.
The intercompany obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation in a transaction in which a member that is a party to the reorganization exchanges property in pursuance of the plan of reorganization for a newly issued intercompany obligation of another member that is a party to the reorganization and distributes such
intercompany obligation to a nonmember shareholder or nonmember creditor in a transaction to which section 361(c) applies.
(
8
)
Outbound subgroup exception.
The intercompany obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation in a transaction in which the members of an intercompany obligation subgroup cease to be members of a consolidated group, neither the creditor nor the debtor recognize any income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to the intercompany obligation, and such members constitute an intercompany obligation subgroup of another consolidated group immediately after the transaction.
(C)
Tax benefit rule.
If an assignment or extinguishment of an intercompany obligation in an intercompany transaction is otherwise excepted from the definition of triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
), (
2
), (
5
), or (
6
) of this section (and not also under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) or (
4
) of this section), and the assignment or extinguishment is engaged in with a view to shift items of built-in gain, loss, income, or deduction from the obligation from one member to another member in order to secure a tax benefit (as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section) that the group or its members would not otherwise enjoy in a consolidated or separate return year, then the assignment or extinguishment will be a triggering transaction to which paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section applies.
(ii)
Application of deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
This paragraph (g)(3)(ii) applies if a triggering transaction occurs.
(A)
General rule.
If the intercompany obligation is debt of a member, then (except as provided in the following sentence) the debt is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as having been satisfied by the debtor for cash in an amount equal to its fair market value, and then as having been reissued as a new obligation (with a new holding period but otherwise identical terms) for the same amount of cash, immediately before the triggering transaction. However, if the creditor realizes an amount with respect to the debt in the triggering transaction that differs from the debt's fair market value, and the triggering transaction is not an exchange (or deemed exchange) of debt of a member for newly issued debt of a member, then the debt is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as having been satisfied by the debtor for cash in an amount equal to such amount realized, and reissued as a new obligation (with a new holding period but otherwise identical terms) for the same amount of cash, immediately before the triggering transaction. If the triggering transaction is a mark to fair market value under section 475, then the intercompany obligation will be deemed satisfied and reissued for its fair market value (as determined under section 475 and applicable regulations) and section 475 will not otherwise apply with respect to that triggering transaction. If the intercompany obligation is a security of a member, similar principles apply (with appropriate adjustments) to treat the security as having been satisfied and reissued immediately before the triggering transaction.
(B)
Treatment as separate transaction.
The deemed satisfaction and deemed reissuance are treated as transactions separate and apart from the triggering transaction. The deemed satisfaction and reissuance of a member's debt will not cause the debt to be recharacterized as other than debt for Federal income tax purposes.
(4)
Special rules
—(i)
Timing and attributes.
For purposes of applying the matching rule and the acceleration rule to a transaction involving an intercompany obligation (other than a transaction to which paragraph (g)(5) of this section applies)—
(A) Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section (treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are excluded or nondeductible) will not apply to exclude any amount of income or gain attributable to a reduction of the basis of the intercompany obligation pursuant to § 1.1502-36(d), or pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and § 1.1502-28 or any other provision that adjusts the basis of an intercompany obligation as a substitute for income or gain;
(B) Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section (limitation on treatment of intercompany income or gain as excluded from
gross income) does not apply to prevent any intercompany income or gain from the intercompany obligation from being excluded from gross income;
(C) Any income, gain, deduction, or loss from the intercompany obligation is not subject to section 108(a), section 354, section 355(a)(1), section 1091, or, in the case of an extinguishment of an intercompany obligation in a transaction in which the creditor transfers the obligation to the debtor in exchange for stock in such debtor, section 351(a); and
(D) Section 108(e)(7) does not apply upon the extinguishment of an intercompany obligation.
(ii)
Newly issued obligation in intercompany exchange.
If an intercompany obligation is exchanged (or is deemed exchanged) for a newly issued intercompany obligation and the exchange (or deemed exchange) is not a routine modification of an intercompany obligation (as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section), then the newly issued obligation will be treated for all Federal income tax purposes as having an issue price equal to its fair market value.
(iii)
Off-market issuance.
If an intercompany obligation is issued at a rate of interest that is materially off-market (off-market obligation) with a view to shift items of built-in gain, loss, income, or deduction from the obligation from one member to another member in order to secure a tax benefit (as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section), then the intercompany obligation will be treated, for all Federal income tax purposes, as originally issued for its fair market value, and any difference between the amount loaned and the fair market value of the obligation will be treated as transferred between the creditor and the debtor at the time the obligation is issued. For example, if S lends $100 to B in return for an off-market B note valued at $130, and the note is issued with a view to shift items from the note to secure a tax benefit, then the B note will be treated as issued for $130. The $30 difference will be treated as a distribution or capital contribution between S and B (as appropriate) at the time of issuance, and this amount will be reflected in future payments on the note as bond issuance premium. An adjustment to an off-market obligation under this paragraph (g)(4)(iii) will be made without regard to the application of, and in lieu of any adjustment under, section 467 (certain payments for the use of property or services), 482 (allocations among commonly controlled taxpayers), 483 (interest on certain deferred payments), 1274 (determination of issue price for certain debt instruments issued for property), or 7872 (treatment of loans with below-market interest rates).
(iv)
Deferral of loss or deduction with respect to nonmember indebtedness acquired in certain debt exchanges.
If a creditor transfers an intercompany obligation to a nonmember (former intercompany obligation) in exchange for newly issued debt of a nonmember (nonmember debt), and the issue price of the nonmember debt is not determined by reference to its fair market value (for example, the issue price is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274(a) or any other provision of applicable law), then any loss of the creditor otherwise allowable on the subsequent disposition of the nonmember debt, or any comparable tax benefit that would otherwise be available in any other transaction that directly or indirectly results from the disposition of the nonmember debt, is deferred until the date the debtor retires the former intercompany obligation.
(v)
Bad debt reserve.
A member's deduction under section 585 for an addition to its reserve for bad debts with respect to an intercompany obligation is not taken into account, and is not treated as realized for purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section, until the intercompany obligation is extinguished or becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation.
(5)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance of obligations becoming intercompany obligations
—(i)
Application of deemed satisfaction and reissuance
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (g)(5) applies if an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation becomes an intercompany obligation.
(B)
Exceptions.
This paragraph (g)(5) does not apply to an intercompany obligation if either of the following exceptions apply.
(
1
)
Exception to the application of section 108(e)(4).
The obligation becomes an intercompany obligation by reason of an event described in § 1.108-2(e)(2) (exception to the application of section 108(e)(4) in the case of acquisitions by securities dealers); or
(
2
)
Inbound subgroup exception.
The obligation becomes an intercompany obligation in a transaction in which the members of an intercompany obligation subgroup cease to be members of a consolidated group, neither the creditor nor the debtor recognize any income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to the intercompany obligation, and such members constitute an intercompany obligation subgroup of another consolidated group immediately after the transaction.
(ii)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance
—(A)
General rule.
If the intercompany obligation is debt of a member, then the debt is treated for all Federal income tax purposes, immediately after it becomes an intercompany obligation, as having been satisfied by the debtor for cash in an amount determined under the principles of § 1.108-2(f), and then as having been reissued as a new obligation (with a new holding period but otherwise identical terms) for the same amount of cash. If the intercompany obligation is a security of a member, similar principles apply (with appropriate adjustments) to treat the security, immediately after it becomes an intercompany obligation, as satisfied and reissued by the debtor for cash in an amount equal to its fair market value.
(B)
Treatment as separate transaction.
The deemed satisfaction and deemed reissuance are treated as transactions separate and apart from the transaction in which the debt becomes an intercompany obligation, and the tax consequences of the transaction in which the debt becomes an intercompany obligation must be determined before the deemed satisfaction and reissuance occurs. (For example, if the debt becomes an intercompany obligation in a transaction to which section 351 applies, any limitation imposed by section 362(e) on the basis of the intercompany obligation in the hands of the transferee member is determined before the deemed satisfaction and reissuance.) The deemed satisfaction and reissuance of a member's debt will not cause the debt to be recharacterized as other than debt for Federal income tax purposes.
(6)
Special rules
—(i)
Timing and attributes.
If paragraph (g)(5) of this section applies to an intercompany obligation—
(A) Section 108(e)(4) does not apply;
(B) The attributes of all items taken into account from the satisfaction of the intercompany obligation are determined on a separate entity basis, rather than by treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation; and
(C) Any intercompany gain or loss realized by the creditor is not subject to section 354 or section 1091.
(ii)
Waiver of loss carryovers from separate return limitation years.
Solely for purposes of § 1.1502-32(b)(4) and the effect of any election under that provision, any loss taken into account under paragraph (g)(5) of this section by a corporation that becomes a member as a result of the transaction in which the obligation becomes an intercompany obligation is treated as a loss carryover from a separate return limitation year.
(iii)
Deduction of repurchase premium in certain debt exchanges.
If an obligation to which paragraph (g)(5) of this section applies is acquired in exchange for the issuance of an obligation to a nonmember and the issue price of this newly issued obligation is not determined by reference to its fair market value (for example, the issue price is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274(a) or any other provision of applicable law), then, under the principles of § 1.163-7(c), any repurchase premium from the deemed satisfaction of the intercompany obligation under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section will be amortized by the debtor over the term of the obligation issued to the nonmember in the same manner as if it were original issue discount and the obligation to the nonmember had been issued directly by the debtor.

Examples
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph
(g), unless otherwise stated, interest is qualified stated interest under § 1.1273-1(c), and the intercompany obligations are capital assets and are not subject to section 475.
(ii) The application of this section to obligations of members is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1. Interest on intercompany obligation
—(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. B fully performs its obligations. Under their separate entity methods of accounting, B accrues a $10 interest deduction annually under section 163, and S accrues $10 of interest income annually under section 61(a)(4) and § 1.446-2.
(
2
)
Matching rule.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the accrual of interest on B's note is an intercompany transaction. Under the matching rule, S takes its $10 of income into account in each of years 1 through 5 to reflect the $10 difference between B's $10 of interest expense taken into account and the $0 recomputed expense. S's income and B's deduction are ordinary items. (Because S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item would both be ordinary on a separate entity basis, the attributes are not redetermined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.)
(
3
)
Original issue discount.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B borrows $90 (rather than $100) from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. The principles described in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
) for stated interest also apply to the $10 of original issue discount. Thus, as B takes into account its corresponding expense under section 163(e), S takes into account its intercompany income under section 1272. S's income and B's deduction are ordinary items.
(
4
)
Tax-exempt income.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B's borrowing from S is allocable under section 265 to B's purchase of state and local bonds to which section 103 applies. The timing of S's income is the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
). Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's corresponding item of disallowed interest expense control the attributes of S's offsetting intercompany interest income. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not prevent the redetermination of S's intercompany item as excluded from gross income because section 265(a)(2) permanently and explicitly disallows B's corresponding deduction and because, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this section, paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply to prevent any intercompany income from the B note from being excluded from gross income. Accordingly, S's intercompany income is treated as excluded from gross income.
(B)
Example 2. Intercompany obligation becomes nonintercompany obligation
—(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has paid the interest accruing under the note and S sells B's note to X for $70, reflecting an increase in prevailing market interest rates. B is never insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3).
(
2
)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $70 immediately before S's sale to X. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for less than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of discharge of indebtedness income under § 1.61-12. On a separate entity basis, S's $30 loss would be a capital loss under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness income control the attributes of S's
loss. Thus, S's loss is treated as ordinary loss. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $70 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $70 basis in the hands of S. S is then treated as selling the new note to X for the $70 received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $70 in the new note, S recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new note held by X is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $70 basis. The $30 of original issue discount will be taken into account by B and X under sections 163(e) and 1272.
(

)
Creditor deconsolidation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that P sells S's stock to X (rather than S selling B's note to X). Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its $70 fair market value immediately before S becomes a nonmember. The treatment of S's $30 of loss and B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness income is the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
). The new note held by S upon deconsolidation is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $70 basis. The $30 of original issue discount will be taken into account by B and S under sections 163(e) and 1272.
(
4
)
Debtor deconsolidation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that P sells B's stock to X (rather than S selling B's note to X). The results to S and B are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section (
Example 2
).
(
5
)
Subgroup exception.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that P owns all of the stock of S, S owns all of the stock of B, and P sells all of the S stock to X, the parent of another consolidated group. Because B and S, members of an intercompany obligation subgroup, cease to be members of the P group in a transaction that does not cause either member to recognize an item with respect to the B note, and such members constitute an intercompany obligation subgroup in the X group, P's sale of S stock is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
8
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. After the sale, the note held by S has a $100 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $100 basis. The results are the same if the S stock is sold to an individual and the S-B affiliated group elects to file a consolidated return for the period beginning on the day after S and B cease to be members of the P group.
(

)
Section 338 election.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that P sells S's stock to X and a section 338 election is made with respect to the stock sale. Under section 338, S is treated as selling all of its assets to new S, including the B note, at the close of the acquisition date. The aggregate deemed sales price (within the meaning of § 1.338-4) allocated to the B note is $70. Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued immediately before S's deemed sale to new S for $70, the amount realized with respect to the note (the aggregate deemed sales price allocated to the note under § 1.338-6). The results to S and B are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
).
(
7
)
Appreciated note.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that S sells B's note to X for $130 (rather than $70), reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of
this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $130 immediately before S's sale to X. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under § 1.163-7(c). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S. S is then treated as selling the new note to X for the $130 received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $130 in the new note, S recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new note held by X is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $130 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $130 basis. The treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new note is determined under § 1.163-13.
(
8
)
Deferral of loss or deduction with respect to nonmember indebtedness acquired in debt exchange.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), except that S sells B's note to X for a non-publicly traded X note with an issue price and face amount of $100 and a fair market value of $70, and that, subsequently, S sells the X note for $70. Because the B note becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued immediately before S's sale to X for $100, the amount realized with respect to the note (determined under section 1274). As a result of the deemed satisfaction, neither S nor B take into account any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss. S is then treated as selling the new B note to X for the X note received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $100 in the new note, S recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to X. After the sale, the new B note held by X is not an intercompany obligation, it has a $100 issue price, a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and a $100 basis. S also holds an X note with a basis of $100 but a fair market value of $70. When S disposes of the X note, S's loss on the disposition is deferred under paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of this section, until B retires its note (the former intercompany obligation in the hands of X).

Example 3. Loss or bad debt deduction with respect to intercompany obligation
—(
1
)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. On January 1 of year 3, the fair market value of the B note has declined to $60 and S sells the B note to P for property with a fair market value of $60. B is never insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3). The B note is not a security within the meaning of section 165(g)(2).
(
2
)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because S realizes an amount of loss from the assignment of the B note, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $60 immediately before S's sale to P. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for less than its adjusted issue price ($100), B takes into account $40 of discharge of indebtedness income under § 1.61-12. On a separate entity basis, S's $40 loss would be a capital loss under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's $40 of discharge of indebtedness income control the attributes of S's loss. Thus, S's loss
is treated as ordinary loss. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $60 issue price, $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and $60 basis in the hands of S. S is then treated as selling the new note to P for the $60 of property received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $60 in the new note, S recognizes no gain or loss from the sale to P. After the sale, the note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $60 issue price and a $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and the $40 of original issue discount will be taken into account by B and P under sections 163(e) and 1272.
(
3
)
Partial bad debt deduction.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section (
Example 3
), except that S claims a $40 partial bad debt deduction under section 166(a)(2) (rather than selling the note to P). Because S realizes a deduction from a transaction comparable to an assignment of the B note, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $60 immediately before section 166(a)(2) applies. The treatment of S's $40 loss and B's $40 of discharge of indebtedness income are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (
Example 3
). After the reissuance, S has a basis of $60 in the new note. Accordingly, the application of section 166(a)(2) does not result in any additional deduction for S. The $40 of original issue discount on the new note will be taken into account by B and S under sections 163(e) and 1272.
(
4
)
Insolvent debtor.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section (
Example 3
), except that B is insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3) at the time that S sells the note to P. As explained in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (
Example 3
), the transaction is a triggering transaction and the B note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $60 immediately before S's sale to P. On a separate entity basis, S's $40 loss would be capital, B's $40 income would be excluded from gross income under section 108(a), and B would reduce attributes under section 108(b) or section 1017 (
see also
§ 1.1502-28). However, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section, section 108(a) does not apply to characterize B's income as excluded from gross income. Accordingly, the attributes of S's loss and B's income are redetermined in the same manner as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (
Example 3
).
(D)
Example 4. Intercompany nonrecognition transactions
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value is $130, reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. On January 1 of year 3, S transfers the note and other assets to a newly formed corporation, Newco, for all of Newco's common stock in an exchange to which section 351 applies.
(
2
)
No deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because the assignment of the B note is an exchange to which section 351 applies and neither S nor B recognize gain or loss, the transaction is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
(
3
)
Receipt of other property.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), except that the other assets transferred to Newco have a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $260, and S receives, in addition to Newco common stock, $15 of cash. Because S would recognize $15 of gain under section 351(b), the assignment of the B note is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value of $130 immediately before the transfer to Newco. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under § 1.163-7(c). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section
1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S. S is then treated as transferring the new note to Newco for the Newco stock and cash received by S in the actual transaction. Because S has a basis of $130 in the new B note, S recognizes no gain or loss with respect to the transfer of the note in the section 351 exchange, and S recognizes $10 of gain with respect to the transfer of the other assets under section 351(b). After the transfer, the note has a $130 issue price and a $100 stated redemption price at maturity. The treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new note is determined under § 1.163-13.
(

)
Transferee loss subject to limitation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), except that T is a member with a loss from a separate return limitation year that is subject to limitation under § 1.1502-21(c) (a SRLY loss), and on January 1 of year 3, S transfers the assets and the B note to T in an exchange to which section 351 applies. Because the transferee, T, has a loss that is subject to a limitation, the assignment of the B note is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section (the exception in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section does not apply). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value, immediately before S's transfer to T. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under § 1.163-7(c). On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as ordinary income. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the satisfaction, a new note to S with a $130 issue price, $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and $130 basis in the hands of S. The treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new note is determined under § 1.163-13. S is then treated as transferring the new note to T as part of the section 351 exchange. Because T will have a fair market value basis in the reissued B note immediately after the exchange, T's intercompany item from the subsequent retirement of the B note will not reflect any of S's built-in gain (and the amount of T's SRLY loss that may be absorbed by such item will be limited to any appreciation in the B note accruing after the exchange).
(

)
Intercompany obligation transferred in section 332 transaction.
The facts are the same as paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section (
Example 4
), except that S transfers the B note to P in complete liquidation under section 332. Because the transaction is an exchange to which section 332 and section 337(a) applies, and neither S nor B recognize gain or loss, the transaction is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
(E)
Example 5. Assumption of intercompany obligation
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. The note is fully recourse and is incurred for use in Business Z. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value is $110 reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates. Business Z has a fair market value of $95. On January 1 of year 3, B transfers all of the assets of Business Z
and $15 of cash (substantially all of B's assets) to member T in exchange for the assumption by T of all of B's obligations under the note in a transaction in which gain or loss is recognized under section 1001. The terms and conditions of the note are not modified in connection with the sales transaction, the transaction does not result in a change in payment expectations, and no amount of income, gain, deduction, or loss is recognized by S, B, or T with respect to the note.
(
2
)
No deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because all of B's obligations under the B note are assumed by T in connection with the sale of the Business Z assets, the assignment of B's obligations under the note is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
(F)
Example 6. Extinguishment of intercompany obligation
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 20. The note is a security within the meaning of section 351(d)(2). As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the fair market value of the B note is $130, reflecting a decline in prevailing market interest rates, and S transfers the note to B in exchange for $130 of B stock in a transaction to which both section 351 and section 354 applies.
(
2
)
No deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
As a result of the satisfaction of the note for more than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account $30 of repurchase premium under § 1.163-7(c). Although the transfer of the B note is a transaction to which both section 351 and section 354 applies, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section, any gain or loss from the intercompany obligation is not subject to either section 351(a) or section 354, and therefore, S has a $30 gain under section 1001. Because the note is extinguished in a transaction in which the adjusted issue price of the note is equal to the creditor's basis in the note, and the debtor's and creditor's items offset in amount, the transaction is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
5
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. On a separate entity basis, S's $30 gain would be a capital gain under section 1271(a)(1). Under the matching rule, however, the attributes of S's intercompany item and B's corresponding item must be redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of B's premium deduction control the attributes of S's gain. Accordingly, S's gain is treated as ordinary income. Under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(D) of this section, section 108(e)(7) does not apply upon the extinguishment of the B note, and therefore, the B stock received by S in the exchange will not be treated as section 1245 property.

Example 7. Exchange of intercompany obligations
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 20. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations and, pursuant to a recapitalization to which section 368(a)(1)(E) applies, B issues a new note to S in exchange for the original B note. The new B note has an issue price, stated redemption price at maturity, and stated principal amount of $100, but contains terms that differ sufficiently from the terms of the original B note to cause a realization event under § 1.1001-3. The original B note and the new B note are both securities (within the meaning of section 354(a)(1)).
(
2
)
No deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because the original B note is extinguished in exchange for a newly issued B note and the issue price of the new B note is equal to both the adjusted issue price of the original B note and S's basis in the original B note, the transaction is not a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section, and the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. B has neither income from discharge of indebtedness under section 108(e)(10) nor
a deduction for repurchase premium under § 1.163-7(c). Although the exchange of the original B note for the new B note is a transaction to which section 354 applies, under paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C) of this section, any gain or loss from the intercompany obligation is not subject to section 354. Under section 1001, S has no gain or loss from the exchange of notes.

On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value has depreciated, reflecting an increase in prevailing market interest rates. On that date, S transfers the B note to member T as part of an exchange for T common stock which is intended to qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 351 but with a view to sell the T stock at a reduced gain. On February 1 of year 4, all of the stock of T is sold at a reduced gain.

)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Because the assignment of the B note does not occur within 12 months of the sale of T stock, paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(
1
)(
vi
) of this section does not apply to treat the assignment as a triggering transaction. However, because the assignment of the B note was engaged in with a view to shift built-in loss from the obligation in order to secure a tax benefit that the group or its members would not otherwise enjoy, under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the assignment of the B note is a triggering transaction to which paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section applies. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued for its fair market value, immediately before S's transfer to T. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note for less than its adjusted issue price, B takes into account discharge of indebtedness income and S has a corresponding loss which is treated as ordinary loss. B is also treated as reissuing, immediately after the deemed satisfaction, a new note to S with an issue price and basis equal to its fair market value. S is then treated as transferring the new note to T as part of the section 351 exchange. Because S's basis in the T stock received with respect to the transferred B note is equal to its fair market value, S's gain with respect to the T stock will not reflect any of the built-in loss attributable to the B note. (This example does not address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply to recharacterize the transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment of the transaction.)

Example 9. Issuance at off-market rate of interest
—(
1
)
Facts.
T is a member with a SRLY loss. T's sole shareholder, P, borrows an amount of cash from T in return for a P note that provides for a materially above market rate of interest. The P note is issued with a view to generate additional interest income to T over the term of the note to facilitate the absorption of T's SRLY loss.
(
2
)
With a view.
Because the P note is issued with a view to shift interest income from the off-market obligation in order to secure a tax benefit that the group or its members would not otherwise enjoy, under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, the intercompany obligation is treated, for all Federal income tax purposes, as originally issued for its fair market value so T is treated as purchasing the note at a premium. The difference between the amount loaned and the fair market value of the obligation is treated as transferred from P to T as a capital contribution at the time the note is issued. Throughout the term of the note, T takes into account interest income and bond premium and P takes into account interest deduction and bond issuance premium under generally applicable Internal Revenue Code sections. The adjustment under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section is made without regard to the application of, and in lieu of any adjustment under, section 482 or 1274.

Example 10. Nonintercompany obligation becomes intercompany obligation
—(

)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, B borrows $100 from X in return for B's note providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of year 5. As of January 1 of year 3, B has fully performed its obligations, but the note's fair market value is $70, reflecting an increase
in prevailing market interest rates. On January 1 of year 3, P buys all of X's stock. B is solvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3).
(
2
)
Deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied for $70 (determined under the principles of § 1.108-2(f)(2)) immediately after it becomes an intercompany obligation. Both X's $30 capital loss (under section 1271(a)(1)) and B's $30 of discharge of indebtedness income (under § 1.61-12) are taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income for year 3. Under paragraph (g)(6)(i)(B) of this section, the attributes of items resulting from the satisfaction are determined on a separate entity basis.
But see
section 382 and § 1.1502-15 (as appropriate). B is also treated as reissuing a new note to X. The new note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $70 issue price and $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and the $30 of original issue discount will be taken into account by B and X in the same manner as provided in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section (
Example 1
).
(

)
Amortization of repurchase premium.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(J)(
1
) of this section (
Example 10
), except that on January 1 of year 3, the B note has a fair market value of $130 and rather than P purchasing the X stock, P purchases the B note from X by issuing its own note. The P note has an issue price, stated redemption price at maturity, stated principal amount, and fair market value of $130. Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied for $130 (determined under the principles of § 1.108-2(f)(1)) immediately after it becomes an intercompany obligation. As a result of the deemed satisfaction of the note, P has no gain or loss and B has $30 of repurchase premium. Under paragraph (g)(6)(iii) of this section, B's $30 of repurchase premium from the deemed satisfaction is amortized by B over the term of the newly issued P note in the same manner as if it were original issue discount and the newly issued P note had been issued directly by B. B is also treated as reissuing a new note to P. The new note is an intercompany obligation, it has a $130 issue price and $100 stated redemption price at maturity, and the treatment of B's $30 of bond issuance premium under the new B note is determined under § 1.163-13.

)
Election to file consolidated returns.
Assume instead that B borrows $100 from S during year 1, but the P group does not file consolidated returns until year 3. Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, B's note is treated as satisfied and reissued as a new note immediately after the note becomes an intercompany obligation. The satisfaction and reissuance are deemed to occur on January 1 of year 3, for the fair market value of the obligation (determined under the principles of § 1.108-2(f)(2)) at that time.

Example 11. Notional principal contracts
—(
1
)
Facts.
On April 1 of year 1, M1 enters into a contract with counterparty M2 under which, for a term of five years, M1 is obligated to make a payment to M2 each April 1, beginning in year 2, in an amount equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined by reference to LIBOR on the day each payment is due, multiplied by a $1,000 notional principal amount. M2 is obligated to make a payment to M1 each April 1, beginning in year 2, in an amount equal to 8 percent multiplied by the same notional principal amount. LIBOR is 7.80 percent on April 1 of year 2, and therefore, M2 owes $2 to M1.
(
2
)
Matching rule.
Under § 1.446-3(d), the net income (or net deduction) from a notional principal contract for a taxable year is included in (or deducted from) gross income. Under § 1.446-3(e), the ratable daily portion of M2's obligation to M1 as of December 31 of year 1 is $1.50 ($2 multiplied by 275/365). Under the matching rule, M1's net income for year 1 of $1.50 is taken into account to reflect the difference between M2's net deduction of $1.50 taken into account and the $0 recomputed net deduction. Similarly, the $.50 balance of the $2 of net periodic payments made on April 1 of year 2 is taken into account for year 2 in M1's and M2's net income and net deduction from the contract. In addition, the attributes of M1's intercompany income and M2's corresponding deduction are redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of M2's corresponding deduction control the attributes of M1's intercompany income. (Although M1 is the selling member with respect to the payment on April 1 of year 2, it might be the buying member in a subsequent period if it owes the net payment.)
(
3
)
Dealer.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(K)(
1
) of this section (
Example 11
), except that M2 is a dealer in securities, and the contract with M1 is not inventory in the hands of M2. Under section 475, M2 must mark its securities to fair market value at year-end. Assume that under section 475, M2's loss from marking to fair market value the contract with M1 is $10. Because M2 realizes an amount of loss from the mark to fair market value of the contract, the transaction is a triggering transaction under paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, M2 is treated as making a $10 payment to M1 to terminate the contract immediately before a new contract is treated as reissued with an up-front payment by M1 to M2 of $10. M1's $10 of income from the termination payment is taken into account under the matching rule to reflect M2's deduction under § 1.446-3(h). The attributes of M1's intercompany income and M2's corresponding deduction are redetermined to produce the same effect as if the transaction had occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the attributes of M2's corresponding deduction control the attributes of M1's intercompany income. Accordingly, M1's income is treated as ordinary income. Under § 1.446-3(f), the deemed $10 up-front payment by M1 to M2 in connection with the issuance of a new contract is taken into account over the term of the new contract in a manner reflecting the economic substance of the contract (for example, allocating the payment in accordance with the forward rates of a series of cash-settled forward contracts that reflect the specified index and the $1,000 notional principal amount). (The timing of taking items into account is the same if M1, rather than M2, is the dealer subject to the mark-to-market requirement of section 475 at year-end. However in this case, because the attributes of the corresponding deduction control the attributes of the intercompany income, M1's income from the deemed termination payment from M2 might be ordinary or capital). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, section 475 does not apply to mark the notional principal contract to fair market value after its deemed satisfaction and reissuance.
(8)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this paragraph (g) apply to transactions involving intercompany obligations occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after December 24, 2008.
(h)
Anti-avoidance rules
—(1)
In general.
If a transaction is engaged in or structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section (including, for example, by avoiding treatment as an intercompany transaction), adjustments must be made to carry out the purposes of this section.
(2)
Examples.
The anti-avoidance rules of this paragraph (h) are illustrated by the following examples. The examples set forth below do not address common law doctrines or other authorities that might apply to recast a transaction or to otherwise affect the tax treatment of a transaction. Thus, in addition to adjustments under this paragraph (h), the Commissioner can, for example, apply the rules of section 269 or § 1.701-2 to disallow a deduction or to recast a transaction.
(i)
Example 1: Sale of a partnership interest
—(A)
Facts.
S owns land with a $10 basis and $100 value. B has net operating losses from separate return limitation years (SRLYs) subject to limitation under § 1.1502-21(c). Pursuant to a plan to absorb the losses without limitation by the SRLY rules, S transfers the land to an unrelated, calendar-year partnership in exchange for a 10% interest in the capital and profits of the partnership in a transaction to which section 721 applies. The partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect. S later sells its partnership interest to B for $100. In the following year, the partnership sells the land to X for $100. Because the partnership does not have a section 754 election in effect, its $10 basis in the land does not reflect B's $100 basis in the partnership
interest. Under section 704(c), the partnership's $90 built-in gain is allocated to B, and B's basis in the partnership interest increases to $190 under section 705. In a later year, B sells the partnership interest to a nonmember for $100.
(B)
Adjustments.
Under § 1.1502-21(c), the partnership's $90 built-in gain allocated to B ordinarily increases the amount of B's SRLY limitation, and B's $90 loss from its sale of the partnership interest ordinarily is not subject to limitation under the SRLY rules. Because the contribution of property to the partnership and the sale of the partnership interest were part of a plan a principal purpose of which was to achieve a reduction in consolidated tax liability by creating offsetting gain and loss for B while deferring S's intercompany gain, B's allocable share of the partnership's gain from its sale of the land is treated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not increasing the amount of B's SRLY limitation.
(ii)
Example 2: Transitory status as an intercompany obligation
—(A)
Facts.
P historically has owned 70% of X's stock and the remaining 30% is owned by unrelated shareholders. On January 1 of Year 1, S borrows $100 from X in return for S's note requiring $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of Year 20. As of January 1 of Year 3, the P group has substantial net operating loss carryovers, and the fair market value of S's note falls to $70 due to an increase in prevailing market interest rates. X is not permitted under section 166(a)(2) to take into account a $30 loss with respect to the note. Pursuant to a plan to permit X to take into account its $30 loss without disposing of the note, P acquires an additional 10% of X's stock, causing X to become a member, and P subsequently resells the 10% interest. X's $30 loss with respect to the note is a net unrealized built-in loss within the meaning of § 1.1502-15.
(B)
Adjustments.
Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, X ordinarily would take into account its $30 loss as a result of the note becoming an intercompany obligation, and S would take into account $30 of discharge of indebtedness income. Under § 1.1502-22, X's loss is not combined with items of the other members and the loss would be carried to X's separate return years as a result of X becoming a nonmember. However, the transitory status of S's indebtedness to X as an intercompany obligation is structured with a principal purpose to accelerate the recognition of X's loss. Thus, S's note is treated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section as not becoming an intercompany obligation.
(iii)
Example 3: Corporate mixing bowl
—(A)
Facts.
M1 and M2 are subsidiaries of P. M1 operates a manufacturing business on land it leases from M2. The land is the only asset held by M2. P intends to dispose of the M1 business, including the land owned by M2; P's basis in the M1 stock is equal to the stock's fair market value. M2's land has a value of $20 and a basis of $0 and P has a $0 basis in the stock of M2. In Year 1, with a principal purpose of avoiding gain from the sale of the land (by transferring the land to M1 with a carry-over basis without affecting P's basis in the stock of M1 or M2), M1 and M2 form corporation T; M1 contributes cash in exchange for 80% of the T stock and M2 contributes the land in exchange for 20% of the stock. In Year 3, T liquidates, distributing $20 cash to M2 and the land (plus $60 cash) to M1. Under § 1.1502-34, section 332 applies to both M1 and M2. Under section 337, T recognizes no gain or loss from its liquidating distribution of the land to M1. T has neither gain nor loss on its distribution of cash to M2. In Year 4, P sells all of the stock of M1 to X and liquidates M2.
(B)
Adjustments.
A principal purpose for the formation and liquidation of T was to avoid gain from the sale of M2's land. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, M2 must take $20 of gain into account when the stock of M1 is sold to X.
(iv)
Example 4: Partnership mixing bowl
—(A)
Facts.
M1 owns a self-created intangible asset with a $0 basis and a fair market value of $100. M2 owns land with a basis of $100 and a fair market value of $100. In Year 1, with a principal purpose of creating basis in the intangible asset (which would be eligible for amortization under section 197), M1 and M2 form partnership PRS; M1 contributes the intangible asset and M2 contributes the land. X, an unrelated
person, contributes cash to PRS in exchange for a substantial interest in the partnership. PRS uses the contributed assets in legitimate business activities. Five years and six months later, PRS liquidates, distributing the land to M1, the intangible to M2, and cash to X. The group reports no gain under sections 707(a)(2)(B) and 737(a) and claims that M2's basis in the intangible asset is $100 under section 732 and that the asset is eligible for amortization under section 197.
(B)
Adjustments.
A principal purpose of the formation and liquidation of PRS was to create additional amortization without an offsetting increase in consolidated taxable income by avoiding treatment as an intercompany transaction. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made.
(v)
Example 5: Sale and leaseback
—(A)
Facts.
S operates a factory with a $70 basis and $100 value, and has loss carryovers from SRLYs. Pursuant to a plan to take into account the $30 unrealized gain while continuing to operate the factory, S sells the factory to X for $100 and leases it back on a long-term basis. In the transaction, a substantial interest in the factory is transferred to X. The sale and leaseback are not recharacterized under general principles of Federal income tax law. As a result of S's sale to X, the $30 gain is taken into account and increases S's SRLY limitation.
(B)
No adjustments.
Although S's sale was pursuant to a plan to accelerate the $30 gain, it is not subject to adjustment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The sale is not treated as engaged in or structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section.
(vi)
Example 6: Section 163(j) interest limitation
—(A)
Facts.
S1 and S2 are members of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. S1 is engaged in an excepted trade or business, and S2 is engaged in a non-excepted trade or business. If S1 were to lend funds directly to S2 in an intercompany transaction, under § 1.163(j)-10(a)(4)(i), the intercompany obligation of S2 would not be considered an asset of S1 for purposes of § 1.163(j)-10 (concerning allocations of interest and other taxable items between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j)). With a principal purpose of avoiding treatment of a lending transaction between S1 and S2 as an intercompany transaction (and increasing the P group's basis in its assets allocable to excepted trades or businesses), S1 lends funds to X (an unrelated third party). X then on-lends funds to S2 on substantially similar terms.
(B)
Analysis.
A principal purpose of the steps undertaken was to avoid treatment of a lending transaction between S1 and S2 as an intercompany transaction. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustments are made, and the X obligation in the hands of S1 is not treated as an asset of S1 for purposes of § 1.163(j)-10, to the extent of the loan from X to S2.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Miscellaneous operating rules.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Successor assets.
Any reference to an asset includes, as the context may require, a reference to any other asset the basis of which is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the first asset.
(2)
Successor persons
—(i)
In general.
Any reference to a person includes, as the context may require, a reference to a predecessor or successor. For this purpose, a predecessor is a transferor of assets to a transferee (the successor) in a transaction—
(A) To which section 381(a) applies;
(B) In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are transferred to members in a complete liquidation;
(C) In which the successor's basis in assets is determined (directly or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of the transferor, but the transferee is a successor only with respect to the assets the basis of which is so determined; or
(D) Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior intercompany transaction.
(ii)
Intercompany items.
If the assets of a predecessor are acquired by a successor member, the successor succeeds
to, and takes into account (under the rules of this section), the predecessor's intercompany items. If two or more successor members acquire assets of the predecessor, the successors take into account the predecessor's intercompany items in a manner that is consistently applied and reasonably carries out the purposes of this section and applicable provisions of law.
(3)
Multiple triggers.
If more than one corresponding item can cause an intercompany item to be taken into account under the matching rule, the intercompany item is taken into account in connection with the corresponding item most consistent with the treatment of members as divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells a truck to B, its intercompany gain from the sale is not taken into account by reference to B's depreciation if the depreciation is capitalized under section 263A as part of B's cost for a building; instead, S's gain relating to the capitalized depreciation is taken into account when the building is sold or as it is depreciated. Similarly, if B purchases appreciated land from S and transfers the land to a lower-tier member in exchange for stock, thereby duplicating the basis of the land in the basis of the stock, items with respect to both the stock and the land can cause S's intercompany gain to be taken into account; if the lower-tier member becomes a nonmember as a result of the sale of its stock, the attributes of S's intercompany gain are determined with respect to the land rather than the stock.
(4)
Multiple or successive intercompany transactions.
If a member's intercompany item or corresponding item affects the accounting for more than one intercompany transaction, appropriate adjustments are made to treat all of the intercompany transactions as transactions between divisions of a single corporation. For example, if S sells property to M, and M sells the property to B, then S, M, and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of applying the rules of this section. Similar principles apply with respect to intercompany transactions that are part of the same plan or arrangement. For example, if S sells separate properties to different members as part of the same plan or arrangement, all of the participating members are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the attributes (which might also affect timing) of the intercompany items and corresponding items from each of the properties.
(5)
Acquisition of group
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (j)(5) applies only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to exist as a result of—
(A) The acquisition of either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or
(B) The application of the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (d)(3).
(ii)
Application.
If the terminating group ceases to exist under circumstances described in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, the surviving group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of applying this section to the intercompany transactions of the terminating group. For example, intercompany items and corresponding items from intercompany transactions between members of the terminating group are taken into account under the rules of this section by the surviving group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of the terminating group that are not members of the surviving group immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (for example, under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c) relating to includible insurance companies).
(6)
Former common parent treated as continuation of group.
If a group terminates because the common parent is the only remaining member, the common parent succeeds to the treatment of the terminating group for purposes of applying this section so long as it neither becomes a member of an affiliated group filing separate returns nor becomes a corporation described in section 1504(b). For example, if the only subsidiary of the group liquidates into the common parent in a complete liquidation to which section 332 applies, or the common parent merges into the subsidiary and the subsidiary is treated as the common parent's successor
under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the taxable income of the surviving corporation is treated as the group's consolidated taxable income in which the intercompany and corresponding items must be included. See § 1.267(f)-1 for additional rules applicable to intercompany losses or deductions.
(7)
Becoming a nonmember.
For purposes of this section, a member is treated as becoming a nonmember if it has a separate return year (including another group's consolidated return year). A member is not treated as having a separate return year if its items are treated as taken into account in computing the group's consolidated taxable income under paragraph (j)(5) or (6) of this section.
(8)
Recordkeeping.
Intercompany and corresponding items must be reflected on permanent records (including work papers). See also section 6001, requiring records to be maintained. The group must be able to identify from these permanent records the amount, location, timing, and attributes of the items, so as to permit the application of the rules of this section for each year.
(9)
Section 987 QBUs.
No intercompany transaction is attributable to a section 987 QBU (within the meaning of § 1.987-2(b)). That is, in order to produce single entity treatment, an intercompany transaction that otherwise would involve the section 987 QBU(s) of one or more members is treated instead as occurring directly between the members (without the involvement of any section 987 QBUs), and transfers are deemed to take place between each section 987 QBU and its owner (
see
§ 1.987-2(c)(2)(ii)). For example, if a member (M1) lends money to the section 987 QBU of another member (M2), this intercompany transaction is treated as a loan from M1 to M2 and a contribution from M2 to its section 987 QBU.
(10)
Examples.
The operating rules of this paragraph (j) are illustrated generally throughout this section, and by the following examples.
(i)
Example 1. Intercompany sale followed by section 351 transfer to member
—(A)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to M for $100. M also holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M transfers the land to B in exchange for all of B's stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Under section 358, M's basis in the B stock is $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and, under section 362(b), B's basis in the land is $100. On December 1 of Year 5, M sells 20% of the B stock to X for $22. In an unrelated transaction on July 1 of Year 8, B sells 20% of the land for $22.
(B)
Definitions.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of the land to M and M's transfer of the land to B are both intercompany transactions. S is the selling member and M is the buying member in the first intercompany transaction, and M is the selling member and B is the buying member in the second intercompany transaction. M has no intercompany items under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Because B acquired the land in an intercompany transaction, B's items from the land are corresponding items to be taken into account under this section. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, references to the land include references to M's B stock. Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, references to M include references to B with respect to the land.
(C)
Timing and attributes resulting from the stock sale.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, M is treated as owning and selling B's stock for purposes of the matching rule even though, as divisions, M could not own and sell stock in B. Under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, both M's B stock and B's land can cause S's intercompany gain to be taken into account under the matching rule. Thus, S takes $6 of its gain into account in Year 5 to reflect the $6 difference between M's $2 gain taken into account from its sale of B stock and the $8 recomputed gain. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of this gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's $6 gain and M's $2 gain are treated as long-term capital gain. The gain would be capital on a separate entity basis (assuming that section 341 does not apply), and this treatment is not inconsistent with
treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation because the stock sale and subsequent land sale are unrelated transactions and B remains a member following the sale.
(D)
Timing and attributes resulting from the land sale.
Under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, S takes $6 of its gain into account in Year 8 under the matching rule to reflect the $6 difference between B's $2 gain taken into account from its sale of an interest in the land and the $8 recomputed gain. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of this gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation and taking into account the activities of S, M, and B with respect to the land. Thus, both S's gain and B's gain might be ordinary income as a result of B's activities. (If B subsequently sells the balance of the land, S's gain taken into account is limited to its remaining $18 of intercompany gain.)
(E)
Sale of successor stock resulting in deconsolidation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(10)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that M sells 60% of the B stock to X for $66 on December 1 of Year 5 and B becomes a nonmember. Under the matching rule, M's sale of B stock results in $18 of S's gain being taken into account (to reflect the difference between M's $6 gain taken into account and the $24 recomputed gain). Under the acceleration rule, however, the entire $30 gain is taken into account (to reflect B becoming a nonmember, because its basis in the land reflects M's $100 cost basis from the prior intercompany transaction). Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of S's gain are determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation. Because M's cost basis in the land will be reflected by B as a nonmember, all of S's gain is treated as from the land (rather than a portion being from B's stock), and B's activities with respect to the land might therefore result in S's gain being ordinary income.
(ii)
Example 2. Intercompany sale of member stock followed by recapitalization
—(A)
Facts.
Before becoming a member of the P group, S owns P stock with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, P buys all of S's stock. On July 1 of Year 3, S sells the P stock to M for $100. On December 1 of Year 5, P acquires M's original P stock in exchange for new P stock in a recapitalization described in section 368(a)(1)(E).
(B)
Timing and attributes.
Although P's basis in the stock acquired from M is eliminated under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the new P stock received by M is exchanged basis property (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(44)) having a basis under section 358 equal to M's basis in the original P stock. Under the successor asset rule of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, references to M's original P stock include references to M's new P stock. Because it is still possible to take S's intercompany item into account under the matching rule with respect to the successor asset, S's gain is not taken into account under the acceleration rule as a result of the basis elimination under paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Instead, the gain is taken into account based on subsequent events with respect to M's new P stock (for example, a subsequent distribution or redemption of the new stock).
(iii)
Example 3. Back-to-back intercompany transactions—matching
—(A)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $70. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to M for $90. M also holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, M sells the land for $100 to B, and B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. During Year 5, B sells all of the land to customers for $105.
(B)
Timing.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of the land to M and M's sale of the land to B are both intercompany transactions. S is the selling member and M is the buying member in the first intercompany transaction, and M is the selling member and B is the buying member in the second intercompany transaction. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, S, M and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining the timing of their items from the intercompany transactions. See also paragraph (j)(2) of this section (B is treated as a successor to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany gain into account). Thus, S's $20 gain and M's $10 gain are both taken into
account in Year 5 to reflect the difference between B's $5 gain taken into account with respect to the land and the $35 recomputed gain (the gain that B would have taken into account if the intercompany sales had been transfers between divisions of a single corporation, and B succeeded to S's $70 basis).
(C)
Attributes.
Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, the attributes of the intercompany items and corresponding items of S, M, and B are also determined by treating S, M, and B as divisions of a single corporation. For example, the attributes of S's and M's intercompany items are determined by taking B's activities into account.
(iv)
Example 4. Back-to-back intercompany transactions—acceleration
—(A)
Facts.
During Year 1, S performs services for M in exchange for $10 from M. S incurs $8 of employee expenses. M capitalizes the $10 cost of S's services under section 263 as part of M's cost to acquire real property from X. Under its separate entity method of accounting, S would take its income and expenses into account in Year 1. M holds the real property for investment and, on July 1 of Year 5, M sells it to B at a gain. B also holds the real property for investment. On December 1 of Year 8, while B still owns the real property, P sells all of M's stock to X and M becomes a nonmember.
(B)
M's items.
M takes its gain into account immediately before it becomes a nonmember. Because the real property stays in the group, the acceleration rule redetermines the attributes of M's gain under the principles of the matching rule as if B sold the real property to an affiliated corporation that is not a member of the group for a cash payment equal to B's adjusted basis in the real property, and S, M, and B were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, M's gain is capital gain.
(C)
S's items.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, S includes the $8 of expenses in determining its $2 intercompany income. In Year 1, S takes into account $8 of income and $8 of expenses. Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made to treat both S's performance of services for M and M's sale to B as occurring between divisions of a single corporation. Thus, S's $2 of intercompany income is not taken into account as a result of M becoming a nonmember, but instead will be taken into account based on subsequent events (
e.g.,
under the matching rule based on B's sale of the real property to a nonmember, or under the acceleration rule based on P's sale of the stock of S or B to a nonmember). See the successor person rules of paragraph (j)(2) of this section (B is treated as a successor to M for purposes of taking S's intercompany income into account).
(D)
Sale of S's stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(9)(iv)(A) of this section (
Example 4
), except that P sells all of S's stock (rather than M's stock) and S becomes a nonmember on July 1 of Year 5. S's remaining $2 of intercompany income is taken into account immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Because S's intercompany income is not from an intercompany sale, exchange, or distribution of property, the attributes of the intercompany income are determined on a separate entity basis. Thus, S's $2 of intercompany income is ordinary income. M does not take any of its intercompany gain into account as a result of S becoming a nonmember.
(E)
Intercompany income followed by intercompany loss.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(9)(iv)(A) of this section (
Example 4
), except that M sells the real property to B at a $1 loss (rather than a gain). M takes its $1 loss into account under the acceleration rule immediately before M becomes a nonmember. But see § 1.267(f)-1 (which might further defer M's loss if M and B remain in a controlled group relationship after M becomes a nonmember). Under paragraph (j)(4) of this section appropriate adjustments must be made to treat the group as if both intercompany transactions occurred between divisions of a single corporation. Accordingly, P's sale of M stock also results in S taking into account $1 of intercompany income as capital gain to offset M's $1 of corresponding capital loss. The remaining $1 of S's intercompany income is taken into account based on subsequent events.
(v)
Example 5. Successor group
—(A)
Facts.
On January 1 of Year 1, B borrows $100 from S in return for B's note
providing for $10 of interest annually at the end of each year, and repayment of $100 at the end of Year 20. As of January 1 of Year 3, B has paid the interest accruing under the note. On that date, X acquires all of P's stock and the former P group members become members of the X consolidated group.
(B)
Successor.
Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, although B's note ceases to be an intercompany obligation of the P group, the note is not treated as satisfied and reissued under paragraph (g) of this section as a result of X's acquisition of P stock. Instead, the X consolidated group succeeds to the treatment of the P group for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, and B's note is treated as an intercompany obligation of the X consolidated group.
(vi)
Example 6. Liquidation—80% distributee
—(A)
Facts.
X has had preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4) outstanding for several years. On January 1 of Year 1, S buys all of X's common stock for $60, and B buys all of X's preferred stock for $40. X's assets have a $0 basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, X distributes all of its assets to S and B in a complete liquidation. Under § 1.1502-34, section 332 applies to both S and B. Under section 337, X has no gain or loss from its liquidating distribution to S. Under sections 336 and 337(c), X has a $40 gain from its liquidating distribution to B. B has a $40 basis under section 334(a) in the assets received from X, and S has a $0 basis under section 334(b) in the assets received from X.
(B)
Intercompany items from the liquidation.
Under the matching rule, X's $40 gain from its liquidating distribution to B is not taken into account under this section as a result of the liquidation (and therefore is not yet reflected under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33). Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, S and B are both successors to X. Under section 337(c), X recognizes gain or loss only with respect to the assets distributed to B. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the purposes of this section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain. The gain will be taken into account by S under the matching and acceleration rules of this section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the intercompany gain to S does not govern the allocation of any other attributes.)
(vii)
Example 7. Liquidation—no 80% distributee
—(A)
Facts.
X has only common stock outstanding. On January 1 of Year 1, S buys 60% of X's stock for $60, and B buys 40% of X's stock for $40. X's assets have a $0 basis and $100 value. On July 1 of Year 3, X distributes all of its assets to S and B in a complete liquidation. Under § 1.1502-34, section 332 applies to both S and B. Under sections 336 and 337(c), X has a $100 gain from its liquidating distributions to S and B. Under section 334(b), S has a $60 basis in the assets received from X and B has a $40 basis in the assets received from X.
(B)
Intercompany items from the liquidation.
Under the matching rule, X's $100 intercompany gain from its liquidating distributions to S and B is not taken into account under this section as a result of the liquidation (and therefore is not yet reflected under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33). Under the successor person rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, S and B are both successors to X. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, to be consistent with the purposes of this section, S succeeds to X's $40 intercompany gain with respect to the assets distributed to B, and B succeeds to X's $60 intercompany gain with respect to the assets distributed to S. The gain will be taken into account by S and B under the matching and acceleration rules of this section based on subsequent events. (The allocation of the intercompany gain does not govern the allocation of any other attributes.)
(viii)
Example 8: Loan by section 987 QBU
—(A)
Facts.
S owns all the interests in DE1, a disregarded entity operating a business that is a section 987 QBU (S QBU) whose functional currency is the euro. S has net unrecognized section 987 gain with respect to S QBU. In year 1, S QBU lends €100 to B with interest due annually. B makes interest payments on the loan to S QBU in years 1 through 3. In year 3, B repays the loan and recognizes section 988 loss of $12 on the loan repayment. All payments are made in euros, and B recognizes no section 988 gain or loss
on the euros it uses to pay the interest and principal. B is never insolvent within the meaning of section 108(d)(3). Other than with respect to the loan, there are no transfers between S and S QBU during years 1 through 3, and neither S nor B had any other foreign currency gain or loss. Neither S nor B has made an election under section 988 or the section 988 regulations.
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
Loan.
Under paragraph (j)(9) of this section, the loan is treated as a transfer from S QBU to S and a loan directly between S and B. Specifically, S is treated as receiving a transfer of €100 from S QBU in year 1; S is then treated as lending €100 directly to B. For purposes of § 1.987-2, the loan is attributable to S, not to S QBU. As an intercompany loan, S's loan to B is subject to the rules of this section. Because there is a remittance from S QBU to S in year 1, S recognizes section 987 gain under § 1.987-5.
(
2
)
Interest payments.
While the loan is outstanding, each of B's interest payments to S QBU is treated as an interest payment from B to S, followed by a transfer from S to S QBU. Under the matching rule in paragraph (c) of this section, S's intercompany interest income offsets B's corresponding interest expense.
See
paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
). Since the functional currency of both S and B is the dollar, if B recognizes any section 988 gain or loss on the interest payments, S will recognize an offsetting amount of section 988 loss or gain. Because the only transfer between S and S QBU in year 2 is from S to S QBU, there is no remittance from S QBU to S and S does not recognize section 987 gain under § 1.987-5.
(
3
)
Repayment.
Upon the year 3 repayment of the loan, B is treated as repaying €100 to S, and S is treated as transferring €100 to S QBU. Since the functional currency of both S and B is the dollar, and B recognizes section 988 loss of $12 on the loan repayment, S will recognize an offsetting section 988 gain of $12. Because the only transfers between S and S QBU in year 3 are from S to S QBU, there is no remittance from S QBU to S and S does not recognize section 987 gain under § 1.987-5.
(4)
Summary.
Overall, the group's taxable income includes S's section 987 gain in year 1 (the section 988 inclusions offset). This result is consistent with the treatment of a single corporation that borrows from its section 987 QBU.
(C)
Loan sold to non-member.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(10)(viii)(A) of this section, except that, in year 3, S QBU sells the loan to unrelated X for €90, reflecting an increase in prevailing market interest rates. Up until the sale, the analysis is the same as in paragraphs (j)(10)(viii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. Because the loan is attributable to S (
see
paragraphs (j)(9) and (j)(10)(viii)(B)(
1
) of this section), the sale is treated as a sale by S. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, immediately before the sale, B is deemed to satisfy and reissue the loan for its fair market value of €90. As a result, B takes into account cancellation of indebtedness income, and S takes into account an offsetting amount of ordinary loss.
See
paragraph (g)(7)(ii) (
Example 2
) of this section. If there is currency gain or loss, S and B take into account offsetting amounts of gain and loss under section 988 (subject to the limitation of § 1.988-2(b)(8)). Because S has a basis of €90 in the new loan, S recognizes no gain or loss on the sale to X. S is then treated as transferring the €90 to S QBU.
(D)
Party becomes a nonmember.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(10)(viii)(A) of this section, except that, in year 3, B becomes a nonmember. Up until B leaves the group, the analysis is the same as in paragraphs (j)(10)(viii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. Immediately before B becomes a nonmember, B is deemed to satisfy and reissue the loan for its fair market value under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, with the same consequences as described in paragraph (j)(10)(viii)(C) of this section. When B becomes a nonmember, the loan (which is no longer an intercompany obligation) ceases to be subject to paragraph (j)(9) of this section. If the loan is attributable to S QBU under § 1.987-2, S is treated as transferring the loan to S QBU.
(ix)
Example 9: Sale of property by section 987 QBU
—(A)
Facts.
M1 owns all
the interests in DE1, a disregarded entity operating a business that is a section 987 QBU (M1 QBU) whose functional currency is the euro. M1 has net unrecognized section 987 gain with respect to M1 QBU. M1 QBU sells property to M2 for €100 in year 1.
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
In general.
Under paragraph (j)(9) of this section, the sale of property is treated as a transfer of the property from M1 QBU to M1, followed by an exchange of the property for €100 directly between M1 and M2, and a transfer of the €100 from M1 to M1 QBU.
(
2
)
Distribution.
M1 QBU is treated as transferring the property to M1.
(
3
)
Exchange.
M1 is then treated as selling the property to M2 for €100. M1 takes into account its intercompany gain or loss on the property under the rules of this section. M2 recognizes intercompany section 988 gain or loss on its exchange of €100 for the property.
See
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for property exchanges between members.
(
4
)
Contribution.
Finally, M1 is treated as transferring the €100 to M1 QBU. Because M1's basis in the €100 equals its fair market value, M1 has a corresponding section 988 gain or loss of zero upon the contribution.
See
§ 1.988-1(a)(10). Both the transfer of the property from M1 QBU to M1 and the transfer of the €100 from M1 to M1 QBU are taken into account in determining whether there is a remittance from M1 QBU to M1 in year 1 and whether M1 recognizes section 987 gain under § 1.987-5.
(
5
)
Summary.
Overall, in year 1, M1 may take into account section 987 gain if the transfers between M1 and M1 QBU result in a remittance, and M2 takes into account section 988 gain or loss on the €100. This result is consistent with the treatment of a single corporation that purchases property from its section 987 QBU.

(l)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies with respect to transactions occurring in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. If both this section and prior law apply to a transaction, or neither applies, with the result that items may be duplicated, omitted, or eliminated in determining taxable income (or tax liability), or items may be treated inconsistently, prior law (and not this section) applies to the transaction. For example, S's and B's items from S's sale of property to B which occurs in a consolidated return year beginning before July 12, 1995, are taken into account under prior law, even though B may dispose of the property in a consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12, 1995. Similarly, an intercompany distribution to which a shareholder becomes entitled in a consolidated return year beginning before July 12, 1995, but which is distributed in a consolidated return year beginning on or after that date is taken into account under prior law (generally when distributed), because this section generally takes dividends into account when the shareholder becomes entitled to them but this section does not apply at that time. If application of prior law to S's deferred gain or loss from a deferred intercompany transaction (as defined under prior law) occurring in a consolidated return year beginning prior to July 12, 1995, would be affected by an intercompany transaction (as defined under this section) occurring in a consolidated return year beginning on or after July 12, 1995, S's deferred gain or loss continues to be taken into account as provided under prior law, and
the items from the subsequent intercompany transaction are taken into account under this section. Appropriate adjustments must be made to prevent items from being duplicated, omitted, or eliminated in determining taxable income as a result of the application of both this section and prior law to the successive transactions, and to ensure the proper application of prior law. Paragraphs (a)(4), (f)(6)(ii), (f)(6)(iv)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
), and (j)(5)(i)(A) of this section apply with respect to transactions occurring on or after September 17, 2008. However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (j)(5)(i)(A) of this section to transactions that occurred prior to September 17, 2008.
(2)
Avoidance transactions.
This paragraph (l)(2) applies if a transaction is engaged in or structured on or after April 8, 1994, with a principal purpose to avoid the rules of this section (and instead to apply prior law). If this paragraph (l)(2) applies, appropriate adjustments must be made in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995, to prevent the avoidance, duplication, omission, or elimination of any item (or tax liability), or any other inconsistency with the rules of this section. For example, if S is a dealer in real property and sells land to B on March 16, 1995 with a principal purpose of converting any future appreciation in the land to capital gain, B's gain from the sale of the land on May 11, 1997 might be characterized as ordinary income under this paragraph (l)(2).
(3)
Election for certain stock elimination transactions
—(i)
In general.
A group may elect pursuant to this paragraph (l)(3) to apply this section (including the elections available under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section) to stock elimination transactions to which prior law would otherwise apply. If an election is made, this section, and not prior law, applies to determine the timing and attributes of S's and B's gain or loss from stock with respect to all stock elimination transactions.
(ii)
Stock elimination transactions.
For purposes of this paragraph (l)(3), a stock elimination transaction is a transaction in which stock transferred from S to B—
(A) Is cancelled or redeemed on or after July 12, 1995;
(B) Is treated as cancelled in a liquidation pursuant to an election under section 338(h)(10) with respect to a qualified stock purchase with an acquisition date on or after July 12, 1995;
(C) Is distributed on or after July 12, 1995; or
(D) Is exchanged on or after July 12, 1995 for stock of a member (determined immediately after the exchange) in a transaction that would cause S's gain or loss from the transfer to be taken into account under prior law.
(iii)
Time and manner of making election.
An election under this paragraph (l)(3) is made by attaching to a timely filed original return (including extensions) for the consolidated return year including July 12, 1995 a statement entitled “[Insert Name and Employer Identification Number of Common Parent] HEREBY ELECTS THE APPLICATION OF § 1.1502-13(l)(3).” See paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section for the manner of electing the relief provisions of paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Prior law.
For transactions occurring in S's years beginning before July 12, 1995, see the applicable regulations issued under section 1502. See §§ 1.1502-13, 1.1502-13T, 1.1502-14, 1.1502-14T, 1.1502-31, and 1.1502-32 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995).
(5)
Consent to adopt method of accounting.
For intercompany transactions occurring in a consolidated group's first taxable year beginning on or after July 12, 1995, the Commissioner's consent under section 446(e) is hereby granted for any changes in methods of accounting that are necessary solely by reason of the timing rules of this section. Changes in method of accounting for these transactions are to be effected on a cut-off basis.

Applicability date regarding paragraph (f)(7)(iv) of this section (Example 4).
Paragraph (f)(7)(iv) of this section (
Example 4
) applies to transactions occurring on or after December 18, 2009.
(7)
Applicability date.
Generally, paragraph (j)(9) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, for which the original Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after December 11, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer chooses to apply §§ 1.987-1
through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (j)(9) of this section applies to that taxable year and subsequent years.
(8)
Election to apply paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section to an intercompany transaction.
Paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(E) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007.
(9)
Election to reduce basis of parent stock under paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
Paragraph (f)(6)(i)(C)(

) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007.
(10)
Certain qualified stock dispositions.
Paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) of this section applies to any qualified stock disposition (as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(6)) for which the disposition date (as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(8)) is on or after May 15, 2013.

The definitions provided in §§ 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b) and 1.1400Z2(d)-1 apply for purposes of this section.
(ii)
Definitions for consolidated groups
—(A)
Day one.
The term
day one
means the date members of the consolidated group formed or acquired section 1504 control of the pre-existing QOF sub. If a pre-existing QOF sub was a member of the consolidated group prior to becoming a QOF C corporation, day one is the first day of the first month in which the member self-certified as, or is treated as, a QOF C corporation, whichever is earlier.
(B)
Election date.
The term
election date
means the date on which an election under paragraph (c) or (f) of this section is made.
(C)
Pre-existing QOF sub.
The term
pre-existing QOF sub
means a subsidiary QOF C corporation that meets the affiliation requirements in section 1504 (without regard to § 1.1504-3(b)(1)) as of May 1, 2019.
(D)
QOF investor member.
The term
QOF investor member
means any member holding a qualifying investment in the QOF member.
(E)
QOF member.
The term
QOF member
means a subsidiary QOF C corporation that is treated as a member of a consolidated group pursuant to an election in § 1.1504-3(b)(2).
(F)
QOF member stock.
The term
QOF member stock
means the QOF stock of a QOF member.
(G)
QOF SAG.
The term
QOF SAG
means, with respect to a QOF member,
the affiliated group that would be determined under section 1504(a) if the QOF member were the common parent.
(H)
Subsidiary QOF C corporation.
The term
subsidiary QOF C corporation
means a QOF C corporation that meets the requirements to be a member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)(1), and without regard to § 1.1504-3(b)(1)) other than the common parent of such consolidated group.
(b)
Subsidiary QOF C corporation treated as member of the consolidated group
—(1)
Effects of election to treat a subsidiary QOF C corporation as a member
—(i)
Determining whether a distribution is an inclusion event.
A distribution of property with respect to qualifying QOF stock by a QOF member to a QOF investor member is an inclusion event to the extent the distribution would create or increase an excess loss account (ELA) in the qualifying QOF stock, without regard to any inclusion resulting from application of this paragraph (b)(1)(i). Solely for purposes of determining whether a distribution creates or increases an ELA during a taxable year, investment adjustments pertaining to a distribution on qualifying QOF stock by a QOF member are made after all other investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 for that year.
(ii)
Determining the amount of deferred gain includible by the QOF investor member.
The amount of gain included in gross income of a QOF investor member under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(B) on a date described in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(b) (modified by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, as applicable) is determined under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii). The amount of gain included in gross income of the QOF investor member is the lesser of:
(A) The product of:
(
1
) The percentage of the qualifying investment that gave rise to the inclusion event; and
(
2
) The remaining deferred gain (see § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(40)), less any basis adjustments pursuant to section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) and (iv); or
(B) The gain that would be recognized on a fully taxable disposition of the qualifying investment that gave rise to the inclusion event.
(iii)
Application of ELA rules on the disposition of QOF member stock.
When a QOF investor member disposes of a share of qualifying QOF member stock, any ELA in the share is taken into account as income or gain from the disposition under § 1.1502-19(b)(1) before the basis of the share is increased under section 1400Z-2(c), if applicable. See paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section for the general rule regarding the treatment of an ELA upon the deconsolidation of a QOF member.
(iv)
Transactions between the QOF member and other members of the consolidated group
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(1)(iv) governs transactions between a member of a QOF SAG and other members of the consolidated group.
(B)
Sale or exchange of property.
A sale or exchange of property between a member of a QOF SAG and a member of the consolidated group that is not a member of a single QOF SAG is not treated as an intercompany transaction (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)) and is not subject to the rules in § 1.1502-13. In contrast, a sale or exchange of property between members of the QOF SAG is an intercompany transaction that is subject to the rules in § 1.1502-13.
(C)
Other transactions.
Any transaction between a member of a QOF SAG and a member of the consolidated group that is not a member of that QOF SAG that is not a sale or exchange of property is an intercompany transaction subject to the rules in § 1.1502-13.
(v)
Separate-entity application of QOF qualifying rules to QOF member.
A consolidated group is not treated as a single entity for purposes of determining whether a QOF member or a qualified opportunity zone business that is a consolidated group member satisfies the investment standard rules in section 1400Z-2(d) and (f) and §§ 1.1400Z2(d)-1 and 1.1400Z2(f)-1. Instead, those investment standard rules apply on a separate-entity basis. Therefore, for example, the QOF member's satisfaction of the requirements under section 1400Z-2(d) is determined by taking into account only property (including qualified opportunity zone stock or qualified opportunity zone partnership interests) held by the QOF member, without regard to property transferred by the
QOF member to other members of the consolidated group.
(2)
Anti-avoidance rule.
The purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations are to provide specified tax benefits to owners of QOFs to encourage the making of longer-term investments, through QOFs and qualified opportunity zone businesses, of new capital in one or more qualified opportunity zones and to increase the economic growth of such qualified opportunity zones. If a transaction is engaged in or structured with a view to avoid the application of the rules of section 1400Z-2, the section 1400Z-2 regulations, or the regulations in this part under section 1502 of the Code (including this section), appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. For example, if a consolidated group engages in a restructuring (such as a distribution described in section 355) with a view to using stock basis adjustments under § 1.1502-32 resulting from increases in the basis of stock under section 1400Z-2(b) in a sale or exchange transaction without disposing of any part of the consolidated group's direct ownership of the relevant qualifying investment, the transaction will be treated as an inclusion event with regard to an appropriate amount of deferred gain.
(c)
Qualifying investments by members of a consolidated group
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section or in § 1.1400Z2(b)-1 (see, for example, § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(9)(i)(B)(
1
)), section 1400Z-2 applies separately to each member of a consolidated group. Therefore, for example, the same member of the consolidated group generally must both engage in the sale of a capital asset giving rise to eligible gain and timely invest an amount equal to some or all of such gain in a QOF (as provided in section 1400Z-2(a)(1)) in order to qualify for deferral of such gain under section 1400Z-2.
(2)
Election to treat investment of one member as a qualifying investment by another member
—(i)
Availability of election.
If members of a consolidated group satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2), the consolidated group may elect to treat an investment by one member as a qualifying investment by another member. The election provided by this paragraph (c)(2) is available when a member of a consolidated group (M1) has eligible gain and a second member (M2) makes an investment in a QOF that would be a qualifying investment if M1, rather than M2, had made the investment. For example, if M1 has $100x of eligible gain but M2 has none, and M2 makes a $120x investment in a QOF C corporation, only $100x of M2's investment in the QOF C corporation is eligible for the election under this paragraph (c)(2). See paragraph (h)(2) of this section for the form and manner of making this election. If M2 has its own eligible gain, M2 may make a qualifying investment on its own behalf and defer such eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1.
(ii)
Effect of election.
If a consolidated group makes an election under this paragraph (c)(2), then M1 is treated as having made the investment in the QOF that is actually made by M2. M1 is then treated as having immediately sold such investment to M2 for fair market value. The deemed sale by M1 is subject to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The consolidated group must treat the deemed investment by M1 and the deemed sale by M1 to M2 as having occurred for all Federal income tax purposes.
(3)
Intercompany transfers of a qualifying investment
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3), when one member (S) transfers its qualifying investment to another member (B), the transaction is not treated as an intercompany transaction within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(b)(1) for purposes of applying the rules of section 1400Z-2 and the section 1400Z-2 regulations. Therefore, § 1.1502-13(c) does not apply to treat S and B as divisions of a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2. For example, if S transfers its qualifying investment to B in a section 351 transaction, the transfer is an inclusion event for S under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). In addition, because the transfer is not an intercompany transaction for purposes of section 1400Z-2, § 1.1502-13 does not apply to continue S's deferral under § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(a)(1).
(ii)
Application of § 1.1502-13 to fully taxable intercompany transfers of a qualifying investment
—(A)
Applicable transactions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, if S transfers its qualifying investment to B in a fully taxable transaction, the transaction is treated as an intercompany transaction, and § 1.1502-13(c) applies to treat S and B as divisions of a single entity for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2.
(B)
Treatment of S's intercompany gain on its qualifying investment.
If a transaction is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) is inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's gain (or the treatment of such gain as tax-exempt income) on the application of section 1400Z-2(b) and (c) to S and B as a single entity. Thus, S's gain on the qualifying investment (including the amount includible under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)) may be redetermined to be excluded from gross income (or treated as tax-exempt income), as appropriate, to achieve single-entity treatment between S and B with regard to the ownership and disposal of the qualifying investment. To qualify for benefits under section 1400Z-2, S and B must otherwise satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-2. See also § 1.1502-13(j)(4) (concerning multiple or successive intercompany transactions).
(C)
Investment adjustments and adjustments to earnings and profits.
Income of S excluded under section 1400Z-2 by application of paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section and § 1.1502-13 results in adjustments to S's earnings and profits and is treated as tax-exempt income to S for purposes of § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).
(D)
Election under section 1400Z-2(c).
To the extent paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section applies to S's transfer of its qualifying investment to B, B (and not S) is entitled to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c) at the time when, treating S and B as divisions of a single entity, the single entity would be entitled to make such an election. For example, pursuant to § 1.1502-13(c)(1)(ii), B takes S's holding period into account in determining whether B is treated as holding the transferred qualifying investment for 10 years. In addition, the attributes of S's intercompany item on the transfer of the qualifying investment may be redetermined based on B's election.
(4)
Intercompany transfer as qualifying investment in a QOF member.
A transfer by a consolidated group member with an eligible gain to a QOF member before January 1, 2027, is not treated as an intercompany transaction within the meaning of § 1.1502-13 and may constitute a qualifying investment. But see § 1.1504-3(b)(2) regarding conditions for consolidating a QOF C corporation.
(5)
Intercompany gain as eligible gain.
When S sells property to B, § 1.1502-13 applies to determine if, and when, S's intercompany gain and B's corresponding gain constitute eligible gain. S's gain and B's gain are treated as eligible gain only to the extent such gain would be eligible gain if S and B were divisions of a single entity. For example, if S sells a piece of property to B at a gain, B subsequently sells that property to an unrelated party at a further gain, and the gains are treated as capital gain under § 1.1502-13(c)(1) and (4), then both S's gain and B's gain are eligible gains at the time B sells the property to the unrelated party. In contrast, if S sells a piece of property to B at a loss, and B subsequently sells that property to an unrelated party at a gain, then B's corresponding gain on the property is eligible gain only to the extent that S and B, if treated as divisions of a single entity, would have eligible gain on the sale of property to the unrelated party. See § 1.1502-13(a)(1).
(d)
Tiering-up of investment adjustments provided by section 1400Z-2.
Basis increases in a qualifying investment in a QOF under sections 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii), 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iv), and 1400Z-2(c) are treated as satisfying the requirements of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(A) and thus qualify as tax-exempt income to the QOF owner. Therefore, if the QOF owner is a member of a consolidated group and is owned by other members of the same consolidated group (upper-tier members), the upper-tier members increase their bases in the shares of the QOF owner under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii). However, there is no basis adjustment under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) in shares of upper-
tier members with regard to a basis adjustment under section 1400Z-2(c) and § 1.1400Z2(c)-1 unless and until the basis of the qualifying investment is adjusted to its fair market value, as provided in section 1400Z-2(c) and § 1.1400Z2(c)-1.
(e)
Application of § 1.1502-36(d).
This paragraph (e) clarifies how § 1.1502-36(d) applies if a member (M) transfers a loss share of another member (S) that is a QOF owner that owns a qualifying investment. To determine S's attribute reduction amount under § 1.1502-36(d)(3), S's basis in its qualifying investment is included in S's net inside attribute amount to compute S's aggregate inside loss under § 1.1502-36(d)(3)(iii)(A). However, S's basis in the qualifying investment is not included in S's Category D attributes available for attribute reduction under § 1.1502-36(d)(4). Thus, S's basis in the qualifying investment cannot be reduced under § 1.1502-36(d). If S's attribute reduction amount exceeds S's attributes available for reduction, then to the extent of the lesser of S's basis in the qualifying investment or the remaining attribute reduction amount, the common parent is treated as making the election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reduce M's basis in the transferred loss S shares.
(f)
Transition relief
—(1)
Overview.
This paragraph (f) provides options for elective relief to pre-existing QOF subs. An election under this paragraph (f) is made in the manner provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. If a timely election under this paragraph (f) is not made, the pre-existing QOF sub is treated as deconsolidating on March 13, 2020.
(2)
Reclassification election
—(i)
In general.
For each pre-existing QOF sub of a consolidated group, the consolidated group may make one of the alternative, irrevocable elections provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section. All elective relief provided in this paragraph (f)(2) is effective on day one.
(ii)
Treatment as a QOF partnership
—(A)
Election.
A consolidated group may elect to treat a pre-existing QOF sub as a QOF partnership (electing QOF partnership). To be eligible for the election in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A), a pre-existing QOF sub must have converted to an entity treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes as of the election date.
(B)
Effect of the QOF partnership election.
As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated as a QOF partnership from day one. Consequently, the consolidated group must file amended or superseding returns, as applicable, to account for the electing QOF partnership's income, gain, deduction, and loss; the electing QOF partnership also must file its own partnership returns for taxable periods beginning on day one, as applicable. The electing QOF partnership must include its self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a) with its own returns, and the self-certification will be treated as timely so long as the consolidated group filed a timely self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-1(a) for the pre-existing QOF sub. In addition, appropriate adjustments must be made to account for the change in status of the electing QOF partnership from day one, including modifications to investment adjustments to the basis in members' stock made under § 1.1502-32 and adjustments to members' earnings and profits made under § 1.1502-33.
(C)
Pre-existing QOF sub with single owner.
If a pre-existing QOF sub is wholly owned by one member of a consolidated group, then for purposes of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the electing QOF partnership is deemed to have had a nominal partner from day one until the date the electing QOF partnership is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes without regard to this paragraph (f)(2)(ii).
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii).
(

)
Facts.
P, the common parent of a consolidated group (P group), wholly owns M1 and M2. On July 1, 2018, M1 and M2 each sell an asset to an unrelated party and realize $70x and $30x of eligible gain, respectively. On August 13, 2018, M1 and M2 form Q12 (a QOF C corporation that was formed as a corporation under state law). Also on August 13, 2018, M1 and M2 contribute $70x
and $30x, respectively, to Q12 in exchange for stock of Q12 and properly elect to defer their respective eligible gains under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. The P group also makes a timely self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-(1)(a) for Q12. Following March 13, 2020, the P group intends to timely elect under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) to treat Q12 as a QOF partnership.

Analysis
—(
i
)
Eligibility to elect.
For the P group to elect to treat Q12 as a QOF partnership under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), by the date of the election, Q12 must either convert to a state law partnership or another entity treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.
(
ii
)
Consequences of the election.
As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), Q12 is treated as a QOF partnership from August 13, 2018 (day one). The P group must file amended or superseding returns, as applicable and as necessary, to account for Q12's income, gain, deduction, and loss. In addition, Q12 must file its own returns for the taxable period beginning on August 13, 2018, as applicable. The returns must be filed within the time frame provided in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section. Finally, because the P group filed a timely self-certification under § 1.1400Z2(d)-(1)(a) for Q12 as a QOF C corporation, Q12's self-certification as a QOF partnership would be is considered timely filed.

Deemed nominal partner
—(
i
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D)(
1
) of this section, except that on July 1, 2018, only M1 sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $70x of eligible gain. On August 13, 2018, M1 contributes cash of $70x to Q12 in exchange for stock of Q12 and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. As of the date the election is made to treat Q12 as a partnership from day one, a second party invests in Q12, and Q12 is an entity treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
The analysis is generally the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(D)(
2
) of this section. In addition, because Q12 is wholly owned by M1, solely for purposes of treating Q12 as a QOF partnership from August 13, 2018, Q12 is deemed to have a nominal partner from August 13, 2018 until the election date or the date Q12 qualifies as a partnership, if earlier.
(iii)
Treatment as a non-member QOF C corporation
—(A)
Election.
A consolidated group may elect to treat a pre-existing QOF sub as a QOF C corporation that is not a member of the consolidated group.
(B)
Effect of the non-member QOF C corporation election.
As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(iii), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated as not being a member of the consolidated group from day one. Consequently, the consolidated group must file amended or superseding returns, as applicable, to exclude all of the pre-existing QOF sub's income, gain, deduction, and loss from the consolidated returns; the pre-existing QOF sub also must file its own returns for taxable periods beginning on day one, as applicable. In addition, all adjustments resulting from the pre-existing QOF sub's operations must be eliminated from the consolidated group, including investment adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to basis in members' stock (as well as stock in the pre-existing QOF sub) and adjustments made under § 1.1502-33 to members' earnings and profits.
(iv)
Treatment as a non-QOF C corporation
—(A)
Election.
A consolidated group may elect to treat a pre-existing QOF sub as if it never self-certified to be a QOF pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(d)-1.
(B)
Effect of the non-QOF C corporation election.
As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), the pre-existing QOF sub is treated from day one as a member of the consolidated group and not as a QOF. Therefore, section 1400Z-2 is not applicable, and amended returns or superseding returns must be filed, as applicable, to account for the eligible gain that was invested in the pre-existing QOF sub. In addition, appropriate adjustments must be made to account for the non-applicability of section 1400Z-2, including adjustments to members' stock basis and earnings and profits under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33, respectively.
(3)
Election to continue treating pre-existing QOF sub as a member of the consolidated group
—(i)
Election.
A consolidated group may elect to have a pre-existing QOF sub retain its QOF status and remain a member of the consolidated group.
(ii)
Effects of electing to remain a QOF and a member of the consolidated group.
As a result of making the election under this paragraph (f)(3), the conditions and effects provided in § 1.1504-3(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section will apply to the pre-existing QOF sub and the consolidated group as of the effective date of this election. See paragraph (h)(1) of this section for the effective date of this election, and see paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section regarding the timing for meeting the requirements in § 1.1504-3(b)(2)(ii).
(g)
Deconsolidation rules
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (g) provides rules applicable on any deconsolidation of a QOF C corporation (deconsolidating QOF).
(2)
Deconsolidation and inclusion event.
A deconsolidation event is not an inclusion event unless the deconsolidation is the result of an actual transfer of the QOF member stock or a worthlessness event within the meaning of § 1.1502-80(c). For example, when a consolidated group fails to meet the conditions in § 1.1504-3(b)(2) of this section and causes a QOF member to deconsolidate, the deconsolidation event is not an inclusion event solely as a result of the consolidated group's failure to meet the requirements in § 1.1504-3(b)(2) of this section.
(3)
Basis in the deconsolidating QOF at time of deconsolidation
—(i)
ELA in a deconsolidating QOF.
Any ELA in stock of the deconsolidating QOF at the time of the deconsolidation is taken into account under the rules of § 1.1502-19. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for rules coordinating the application of section 1400Z-2(c) with § 1.1502-19.
(ii)
Positive basis in the deconsolidating QOF resulting from § 1.1502-32.
Consolidated group members retain any positive basis in the deconsolidating QOF resulting from investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 following its deconsolidation. However, following the deconsolidation, for purposes of determining the amount includible under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e), the amount of basis referred to in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(A)(ii) is computed by applying only those rules applicable to corporations that do not file a consolidated return (that is, the basis rules under subchapter C and section 1400Z-2). Therefore, any positive basis resulting from § 1.1502-32 adjustments is not taken into account in computing the amount includable under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e).
(4)
Deconsolidating QOF's earnings and profits
—(i)
Deconsolidation on or before December 31, 2026.
Notwithstanding § 1.1502-33(e)(1), if a deconsolidating QOF deconsolidates before December 31, 2026, the deconsolidating QOF retains its earnings and profits under this paragraph (g)(4)(i). Any earnings and profits of the deconsolidating QOF that were taken into account by any other members under § 1.1502-33 are eliminated from those members as of the end of the day on which the deconsolidating QOF deconsolidates.
(ii)
Deconsolidation after December 31, 2026.
If the deconsolidating QOF deconsolidates after December 31, 2026, the rules under § 1.1502-33(e) apply.
(5)
Consequences under § 1.1502-36.
See § 1.1502-36(f)(10)(i)(B) for the treatment of a deconsolidation as a transfer of all of the stock in the deconsolidating member held by other members of the consolidated group.
(h)
Form and manner of making an election under this section
—(1)
In general.
The elections provided in this section are irrevocable. The information required for each election is provided in this paragraph (h). A reclassification election under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is effective as of day one. All other elections are effective on the election date.
(2)
Election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to treat investment by M2 as qualifying investment by M1
—(i)
Form of election.
The election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be made in the form of a statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-14Z(c)(2) TO TREAT AN INVESTMENT BY [insert name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of M2] AS A QUALIFYING INVESTMENT BY [insert name and E.I.N. of M1].” The statement must be included with the
consolidated group's timely filed return (original, superseding, or amended return, as applicable, including extensions). In addition, the statement must include the information required under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Required information.
(A) The amount of M1's eligible gain;
(B) The amount of the investment M2 has made in a QOF, including identification of the amount of the investment that is eligible for treatment as a qualifying investment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the amount (if any) that is not eligible for such treatment; and
(C) The date on which M1 recognized its eligible gain, and the date on which M2 made the investment in the QOF.
(3)
Elections under paragraph (f) of this section for transition relief

(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, and unless otherwise stated: P is the common parent of the P consolidated group (P group); S, B, and M are members of the P group; Q is a QOF C corporation that is not a member of the P group; and X is an unrelated party.
(1)
Example 1: Distribution by a QOF member and inclusion events
—(i)
Facts.
P wholly owns S. In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500x of eligible gain. S forms a new QOF C corporation Q2, contributes $500x to Q2 in exchange for stock of Q2, and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. The P group elects under § 1.1504-3(b)(2) to consolidate Q2. In 2024, Q2 distributes $20x to S when S's basis in Q2 is $50x, the value of Q2 exceeds $500x, and Q2 has no earnings and profits. There are no other events in 2024 that result in investment adjustments to Q2 stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under §§ 1.1502-13(f)(2) and 1.1502-32, the intercompany distribution from Q2 to S of $20x reduces S's basis in Q2 to $30x ($50x−$20x). Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because the distribution does not create or increase an ELA in Q2 stock, the distribution is not an inclusion event.
(iii)
Distribution that creates an ELA.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section except that in 2024 Q2 distributes $70x to S. Under §§ 1.1502-13(f)(2) and 1.1502-32, the intercompany distribution from Q2 to S of $70x reduces S's basis in Q2 to $0 and creates an ELA of $20x ($50x−$70x). Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, because an ELA is created in Q2's stock, the distribution is an inclusion event to the extent of the increase in the ELA. S therefore includes $20x of its deferred gain into income in 2024. See § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(2). In addition, under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(g)(1)(ii), the adjustment to S's basis in Q2 under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(ii) is applied before determining the other Federal income tax consequences of the distribution. Therefore, as a result of the inclusion event, S's basis in Q2 is first increased to $70x ($50x + $20x), and then S's basis in Q2 is reduced by $70x (the amount of the distribution) to $0 under § 1.1502-32.
(2)
Example 2: Basis adjustment when member owns qualifying QOF stock
—(i)
Facts.
P wholly owns S. In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $500x of eligible gain. S contributes $500x to Q in exchange for stock of Q and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. S does not otherwise own stock in Q. In 2026, the fair market value of S's qualifying investment in Q exceeds $500x. In 2029, when S still owns its qualifying investment in Q, P sells
all of the stock of S to X. S retains its stock in Q.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Five-year and seven-year basis increase and § 1.1502-32 tier-up.
In 2023, when S has held the stock of Q for five years, under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii), S increases its basis in its Q stock by $50x (10 percent of $500x, the amount of gain deferred by reason of section 1400Z-2(a)(1)(A)). The 10-percent basis increase qualifies as tax-exempt income to S under paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, P (an upper-tier member) increases its basis in S's stock by $50x under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii). Similarly, in 2025, when S has held the stock of Q for seven years, under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iv), S increases its basis in its Q stock by an additional $25x (5 percent of $500x). The 5-percent basis increase also qualifies as tax-exempt income to S under paragraph (d) of this section, and P increases its basis in S's stock by an additional $25x under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).
(B)
S's recognition of deferred capital gain in 2026.
S did not dispose of its Q stock prior to December 31, 2026. Therefore, under section 1400Z-2(b)(1)(B) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(b)(2), S's remaining deferred gain is included in S's income on December 31, 2026. The amount of gain included under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(A) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(3) is $425x ($500x of remaining deferred gain less S's $75x basis in Q). S's basis in Q is increased by $425x to $500x, and P's basis in S also is increased by $425x under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(i).
(C)
P's disposition of S.
P's sale of S stock in 2029 results in the deconsolidation of S. S retains its Q stock, and S is not treated as selling or exchanging its Q stock for purposes of section 1400Z-2(c). Therefore, no basis adjustments under section 1400Z-2 are made as a result of P's sale of S stock.
(iii)
S sells the stock of Q after 10 years.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, except that in 2029, instead of P selling all of the stock of S, S sells all of the stock of Q to X for its fair market value of $800x. At the time of the sale, S has owned the Q stock for over 10 years, and S elects under section 1400Z-2(c) to adjust its stock basis in Q from $500x (see the analysis in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) to $800x, the fair market value of Q on the date of the sale. As a result of the election, S has no gain on the sale of Q stock. Additionally, the $300x basis increase in Q is treated as tax-exempt income to S pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Thus, P increases its basis in P's S stock by $300x under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).
(3)
Example 3: Intercompany sale of qualifying investment
—(i)
Facts.
In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $100x of eligible gain. Also in 2018, S contributes $100x to Q in exchange for Q stock and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. S does not otherwise own stock in Q. In 2021, S sells all of its Q stock to B for $250x in a fully taxable transaction. In 2026, the fair market value of Q is $300x. In 2030, B sells the Q stock to X for $800x.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Intercompany sale treated as an inclusion event.
In 2021, S's sale of its Q stock to B is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e)(1) is $100x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $250x, over S's basis in Q, $0). As a result of the inclusion, S's basis in Q increases from $0 to $100x and S also realizes a capital gain of $150x ($250x of amount realized less its $100x basis in the Q stock) from the intercompany sale of Q to B. Because S's sale of its Q stock to B is a fully taxable transaction, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies to treat the sale as an intercompany transaction and S's intercompany gains are taken into account under § 1.1502-13(c)(2)(ii). Thus, S defers the inclusion of its $100x of remaining deferred gain and its $150x of capital gain in 2021. B has a $250x basis in its Q stock.
(B)
Five-year basis increase in 2023.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, S and B are treated as divisions of a single entity for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2. In 2023, the single entity would have held the QOF investment for five years and its basis in Q would be increased to $10x ($100x × 10%) under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii). To achieve this single entity result, $10x of S's $100x of remaining deferred gain is redetermined to be tax-exempt
income. See § 1.1502-13(c)(1); see also paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section making § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's intercompany gain. Therefore, in 2023, S is treated as having $10x of tax-exempt income, S's remaining deferred gain is $90x ($100x−$10x), while B's basis in Q remains $250x.
(C)
Seven-year basis increase in 2025.
The same analysis in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(B) of this section applies for the year 2025. Therefore, in 2025, S is treated as having $5x ($100x × 5%) of tax-exempt income, S's remaining deferred gain is $85x ($90x−$5x), and B's basis in Q remains $250x.
(D)
Inclusion of S's remaining deferred gain in 2026.
B continues to own the Q stock through 2026, and, treating S and B as divisions of a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2, the single entity would include its remaining deferred gain in income on December 31, 2026. See section 1400Z-2(b)(1), § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(b). On a single-entity basis, the amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $85x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $300x, over the single entity's basis in Q, $15x). B does not otherwise have an income event with respect to its Q stock in 2026. Therefore, under § 1.1502-13(c), all $85x of S's remaining deferred gain is taken into account in 2026. In addition, S's $150x of capital gain on its Q stock sale continues to be deferred, and B's basis in Q remains $250x.
(E)
B sells the Q stock in 2030.
In 2030, B sells all its Q stock to X for $800x. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, B is entitled to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c) if, treating S and B as a single entity, the single entity would be eligible to make the election. Taking into account S's holding period, B has held Q for over 10 years, and B is eligible for the election when it sells Q to X in 2030. B makes the section 1400Z-2(c) election at the time of sale. Following the election, if S and B were divisions of a single entity, the single entity's basis in Q would increase from $100x to its fair market value of $800x, causing to be excluded the $700x of gain on the sale of Q stock. To achieve this single entity result, § 1.1502-13(c)(1) redetermines B's $550x ($800x−$250x) of gain and S's deferred $150x of capital gain to be tax-exempt income. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section making § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's intercompany gain. Therefore, as a result of the sale of the Q stock and B making the section 1400Z-2(c) election, S has $150x of tax-exempt income, and B has $550x of tax-exempt income.
(4)
Example 4: Intercompany sale of qualifying investment followed by sale of QOF at a loss outside of the consolidated group
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section, except that in 2030, B sells the stock of Q for $225x to X.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis for tax years prior to 2030 is the same as in paragraphs (j)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. In addition, applying the analysis in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, B is entitled to make the election under section 1400Z-2(c) and B makes the election. Following the election, if S and B were divisions of a single entity, the single entity's basis in Q would increase from $100x to $225x, causing to be excluded the $125x of gain on the sale of Q stock. To achieve this single entity result, § 1.1502-13(c)(1) redetermines B's $25x ($225x−$250x) of loss to be a noncapital, nondeductible expense and S's deferred $150x of capital gain to be tax-exempt income. Therefore, as a result of the sale of Q stock and B making the section 1400Z-2 election, S has $150x of tax-exempt income, and B has $25x of noncapital, nondeductible expense.
(5)
Example 5: Intercompany section 351 transfer of qualifying investment
—(i)
Facts.
In 2018, M sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $100x of eligible gain. Also in 2018, M contributes $100x to Q in exchange for Q stock and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. M does not otherwise own stock in Q. In 2021, when the value of Q is $200x, M contributes all of its Q stock to S in exchange for S stock in a transaction that qualifies under section 351.
(ii)
Analysis.
In 2021, M's contribution of its Q stock to S is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and
§ 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $100x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $200x, over S's basis in Q, $0). Because M's contribution of its Q stock to S is not a fully taxable transaction, the general rule in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies to treat the contribution as not an intercompany transaction for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2, and § 1.1502-13 does not apply to treat M and S as a single entity for purposes of section 1400Z-2. Thus, as a result of the transfer, M takes its $100x of remaining deferred gain into account, M's basis in S is $100x, and S's basis in Q is $100x.

Section 351 transfer to another member of the consolidated group
—(A)
Facts.
In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $100x of eligible gain. Also in 2018, S contributes $100x to Q in exchange for Q stock and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. S does not otherwise own stock in Q. In 2021, when the fair market value of the Q stock is $250, S sells all of its Q stock to B for $250x in a fully taxable transaction. In 2024, B transfers all its Q stock to another member of the P group, B2, in a section 351 transaction. At such time, the fair market value of the Q stock is $300x.
(B)
Analysis
—(

)
Intercompany sale in 2021.
In 2021, S's sale of its Q stock to B is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $100x (the lesser of the remaining deferred gain of $100x and the fair market value of the qualifying investment of $250x, over S's basis in Q, $0). As a result of the inclusion, S's basis in its Q stock increases from $0 to $100x and S also realizes a capital gain of $150x ($250x of amount realized less its $100x basis in the Q stock) from the intercompany sale of the Q stock to B. Because S's sale of its Q stock to B is a fully taxable transaction, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies to treat the sale as an intercompany transaction. Therefore, S's intercompany gains are taken into account under § 1.1502-13(c) and (d). Thus, S defers the inclusion of its $100x of remaining deferred gain and its $150x of capital gain in 2021. B has a $250x basis in its Q stock.
(

)
Five-year basis increase in 2023.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, S and B are treated as divisions of a single entity for purposes of applying section 1400Z-2. In 2023, the single entity has held the QOF investment for five years and its basis in the Q stock would be increased to $10x ($100x × 10%) under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii). To achieve this single entity result, $10x of S's $100x of remaining deferred gain is redetermined to be tax-exempt income. See § 1.1502-13(c)(1); see also paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section making § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii) inapplicable in determining the excludability of S's intercompany gain. Therefore, in 2023, S is treated as having $10x of tax-exempt income, S's remaining deferred gain is $90x ($100x−$10x), and B's basis in the Q stock remains $250x.

)
Intercompany transfer in a section 351 transaction.
In 2024, B's contribution of its Q stock to B2, a member of the P group, is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $90x (the remaining deferred gain as determined in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section). Because B's contribution of its Q stock to B2 is not a fully taxable transaction, the general rule in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies to prevent the contribution from being treated as an intercompany transaction for purposes of section 1400Z-2. As a result, for purposes of section 1400Z-2, § 1.1502-13 does not apply to treat B and B2 as a single entity, and the application of § 1.1502-13(j) is adjusted accordingly. As a result of the section 351 transfer, S takes its $90x of remaining deferred gain into account. B's basis in its B2 stock is $250x, and B's basis in its Q stock is $250x. However, because S's $150x of capital gain from the intercompany sale of its Q stock to B in 2021 is not an item related to section 1400Z-2, it continues to be deferred under § 1.1502-13 because B2 is a member of the P group.
See § 1.1502-13(j)(4) regarding successive intercompany transactions.

Transfer of Q to a non-member in a section 351 transaction.
In 2024, B's contribution of its Q stock to B2, a non-member of the P group, is an inclusion event under section 1400Z-2(b)(1) and § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c). The amount includible pursuant to § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(e) is $90x (the remaining deferred gain as determined in paragraph (j)(6)(ii)(B)(1) of this section). S's deferred capital gain of $150x is taken into account in 2024 under the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d) because the Q stock has left the P group. B2's holding period for the qualifying investment does not include the time during which B and S held the qualifying investment.

Transfer of Q stock to a partnership in a section 721(a) transaction.
In 2024, B transfers its Q stock to B2, a partnership, in a section 721(a) transaction. Although a section 721(a) transaction is not an inclusion event under § 1.1400Z2(b)-1(c)(7), under the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d), S must take into account its $90x of remaining deferred gain because B2 has benefited from an increased basis in the Q stock as a result of the intercompany sale between S and B such that this is the appropriate time to take the remaining deferred gain into account. S's deferred capital gain of $150x is taken into account in 2024 for the same reason.

In 2018, S sells an asset to an unrelated party and realizes $5,000x of eligible gain. S contributes $5,000x to Q in exchange for stock of Q and properly elects to defer the eligible gain under section 1400Z-2(a) and § 1.1400Z2(a)-1. In 2024, M sells all of its S stock to X for its fair market value of $100x, and M's basis in the stock of S is $300x. At the time of sale, S owns the Q stock with a basis of $500x (S's basis in its Q stock was increased under section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(B)(iii) to $500x in 2023), and S has a net operating loss carryover of $50x. M's transfer of the S shares is a transfer of loss shares under § 1.1502-36. Assume that no basis redetermination is required under § 1.1502-36(b) and no basis reduction is required under § 1.1502-36(c).
(ii)
Attribute reduction under § 1.1502-36(d).
Under § 1.1502-36(d), S's attributes are reduced by S's attribute reduction amount. Section 1.1502-36(d)(3) provides that S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the net stock loss and S's aggregate inside loss. The net stock loss is the excess of the $300x aggregate basis of the transferred S shares over the $100x aggregate value of those shares, or $200x. S's aggregate inside loss, which includes the basis of the stock of Q as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, is the excess of S's net inside attribute amount over the value of the S share. S's net inside attribute amount is $550x, computed as the sum of S's $50x loss carryover and its $500x basis in Q. S's aggregate inside loss is therefore $450x ($550x net inside attribute amount over the $100x value of the S share). Accordingly, S's attribute reduction amount is the lesser of the $200x net stock loss and the $450x aggregate inside loss, or $200x. Under § 1.1502-36(d)(4), S's $200x attribute reduction is first allocated and applied to reduce S's $50x loss carryover to $0. Under § 1.1502-36(d)(4)(i)(D), S generally would be able to reduce the basis of its category D assets (including stock in other corporations) by the remaining
attribute reduction amount ($150x). However, paragraph (e) of this section provides that S's basis in the stock of Q is not included in S's Category D attributes that are available for reduction under § 1.1502-36(d)(4), and the remaining $150x of attribute reduction amount cannot be used to reduce the basis of Q shares under § 1.1502-36(d). Rather, under paragraph (e) of this section, P is treated as making the election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reduce M's basis in the transferred loss S shares by $150x. As a result, P's basis in its M stock is also reduced by $150x.

In general.
This section applies for taxable years beginning after March 13, 2020.
(2)
Prior periods.
With respect to the portion of a consolidated group's first taxable year ending after December 21, 2017, and for taxable years beginning after December 21, 2017, and on or before March 13, 2020, a consolidated group may choose either—
(i) To apply the section 1400Z-2 regulations, if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years; or
(ii) To rely on the rules in proposed § 1.1400Z2(g)-1 contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-120186-18) published on May 1, 2019, but only if applied in a consistent manner for all such taxable years.

§ 1.1502-15
SRLY limitation on built-in losses.
(a)
SRLY limitation.
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section (relating to built-in losses of the common parent) and paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), built-in losses are subject to the SRLY limitation under §§ 1.1502-21(c) and 1.1502-22(c) (including applicable subgroup principles). Built-in losses are treated as deductions or losses in the year recognized, except for the purpose of determining the amount of, and the extent to which the built-in loss is limited by, the SRLY limitation for the year in which it is recognized. Solely for such purpose, a built-in loss is treated as a hypothetical net operating loss carryover or net capital loss carryover arising in a SRLY, instead of as a deduction or loss in the year recognized. To the extent that a built-in loss is allowed as a deduction under this section in the year it is recognized, it offsets any consolidated taxable income for the year before any loss carryovers or carrybacks are allowed as a deduction. To the extent not so allowed, it is treated as a separate net operating loss or net capital loss carryover or carryback arising in the year of recognition and, under § 1.1502-21(c) or 1.1502-22(c), the year of recognition is treated as a SRLY.
(b)
Built-in losses
—(1)
Defined.
If a corporation has a net unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) (as modified by this section) on the day it becomes a member of the group (whether or not the group is a consolidated group), its deductions and losses are built-in losses under this section to the extent they are treated as recognized built-in losses under section 382(h)(2)(B) (as modified by this section). This paragraph (b) generally applies separately with respect to each member, but see paragraph (c) of this section for circumstances in which it is applied on a subgroup basis.
(2)
Operating rules.
Solely for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the principles of § 1.1502-94(c) apply with appropriate adjustments, including the following:
(i)
Stock acquisition.
A corporation is treated as having an ownership change under section 382(g) on the day the corporation becomes a member of a group, and no other events (e.g., a subsequent ownership change under section 382(g) while it is a member) are treated as causing an ownership change.
(ii)
Asset acquisition.
In the case of an asset acquisition by a group, the assets and liabilities acquired directly from the same transferor (whether corporate or non-corporate, foreign or domestic) pursuant to the same plan are treated as the assets and liabilities of a corporation that becomes a member of the group (and has an ownership change) on the date of the acquisition.
(iii)
Recognized built-in gain or loss.
A loss that is included in the determination of net unrealized built-in gain or loss and that is recognized but disallowed or deferred (e.g., under § 1.337(d)-2, § 1.1502-35, § 1.1502-36, or section 267) is not treated as a built-in
loss unless and until the loss would be allowed during the recognition period without regard to the application of this section. Section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply to the extent it limits the amount of recognized built-in loss that may be treated as a pre-change loss to the amount of the net unrealized built-in loss.
(c)
Built-in losses of subgroups
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a subgroup, the principles of paragraph (b) of this section apply to the subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the net unrealized built-in loss and recognized built-in loss for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section are based on the aggregate amounts for each member of the subgroup.
(2)
Members of subgroups.
A subgroup is composed of those members that have been continuously affiliated with each other for the 60 consecutive month period ending immediately before they become members of the group in which the loss is recognized. A member remains a member of the subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the loss member. For this purpose, the principles of § 1.1502-21(c)(2)(iv) through (vi) apply with appropriate adjustments.
(3)
Coordination of 60 month affiliation requirement with the overlap rule.
If one or more corporations become members of a group and are included in the determination of a net unrealized built-in loss that is subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such corporations that become members of the group are treated as having been affiliated for 60 consecutive months with the common parent of the group and are also treated as having been affiliated with any other members who have been affiliated or are treated as having been affiliated with the common parent at such time. The corporations are treated as having been affiliated with such other members for the same period of time that those members have been affiliated or are treated as having been affiliated with the common parent. If two or more corporations become members of the group at the same time, but this paragraph (c)(3) does not apply to every such corporation, then immediately after the corporations become members of the group, and solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the corporations to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies are treated as having not been previously affiliated with the corporations to which this paragraph (c)(3) does not apply. If the common parent has become the common parent of an existing group within the previous five year period in a transaction described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2)(ii) or (3), the principles of §§ 1.1502-91(g)(6) and 1.1502-96(a)(2)(iii) shall apply.
(4)
Built-in amounts.
Solely for purposes of determining whether the subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss or whether it has a recognized built-in loss, the principles of § 1.1502-91(g) and (h) apply with appropriate adjustments.
(d)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is disregarded. The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Determination of recognized built-in loss.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized loss of $55 (basis $75, value $20), and asset 2 has an unrealized gain of $20 (basis $30, value $50). P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A during Year 1, and T becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Paragraph (g) of this section does not apply because there is not an overlap of the application of the rules contained in paragraph (a) of this section and section 382.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and solely for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T is treated as having an ownership change under section 382(g) on becoming a member of the P group. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, none of T's $55 of unrealized loss is treated as a built-in loss unless T has a net unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) on becoming a member of the P group.
(iii) Under section 382(h)(3)(A), T has a $35 net unrealized built-in loss on becoming a member of the P group (($55) + $20 = ($35)).
Assume that this amount exceeds the threshold requirement in section 382(h)(3)(B). Under section 382(h)(2)(B), the entire amount of T's $55 unrealized loss is treated as a built-in loss to the extent it is recognized during the 5-year recognition period described in section 382(h)(7). Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the restriction under section 382(h)(1)(B)(ii), which limits the amount of recognized built-in loss that is treated as pre-change loss to the amount of the net unrealized built-in loss, is inapplicable for this purpose. Consequently, the entire $55 of unrealized loss (not just the $35 net unrealized loss) is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as a built-in loss to the extent it is recognized within 5 years of T's becoming a member of the P group. Under paragraph (a) of this section, a built-in loss is subject to the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c)(1).
(iv) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the built-in loss would similarly be subject to a SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c)(1) if T transferred all of its assets and liabilities to a subsidiary of the P group in a single transaction described in section 351. To the extent the built-in loss is recognized within 5 years of T's transfer, all of the items contributed by the acquiring subsidiary to consolidated taxable income (and not just the items attributable to the assets and liabilities transferred by T) are included for purposes of determining the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c)(1).

# Example 2. Actual application of section 382 not relevant.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and Individual B owns all of the stock of T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized loss of $25 (basis $75, value $50), and asset 2 has an unrealized gain of $20 (basis $30, value $50). P buys 55 percent of the stock of T in January of Year 1, resulting in an ownership change of T under section 382(g). During March of Year 2, P buys the 45 percent balance of the T stock, and T becomes a member of the P group.
(ii) Although T has an ownership change for purposes of section 382 in Year 1 and not Year 2, T's joining the P group in Year 2 is treated as an ownership change under section 382(g) solely for purposes of this section. Consequently, for purposes of this section, whether T has a net unrealized built-in loss under section 382(h)(3) is determined as if the day T joined the P group were a change date.

# Example 3. Determination of a recognized built-in loss of a subgroup.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, S, and M. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, P acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A, and S becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of S is not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). At the beginning of Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P from Individual A, and P and S become members of the M group. M's acquisitions of P and S are also not ownership changes as defined by section 382(g). At the time of M's acquisition of the P stock, P has (disregarding the stock of S) a $10 net unrealized built-in gain (two depreciable assets, asset 1 with a basis of $35 and a value of $55, and asset 2 with a basis of $55 and a value of $45), and S has a $75 net unrealized built-in loss (two depreciable assets, asset 3 with a basis of $95 and a value of $10, and asset 4 with a basis of $10 and a value of $20).
(ii) Under paragraph (c) of this section, P and S compose a subgroup on becoming members of the M group because P and S were continuously affiliated for the 60 month period ending immediately before they became members of the M group. Consequently, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to P and S separately. Instead, their separately computed unrealized gains and losses are aggregated for purposes of determining whether, and the extent to which, any unrealized loss is treated as built-in loss under this section and is subject to the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c).
(iii) Under paragraph (c) of this section, the P subgroup has a net unrealized built-in loss on the day P and S become members of the M group, determined by treating the day they become members as a change date. The net unrealized built-in loss is the aggregate of P's net unrealized built-in gain of $10 and S's net unrealized built-in loss of $75, or an aggregate net unrealized built-in loss of $65. (The stock of S owned by P is disregarded for purposes of determining the net unrealized built-in loss. However, any loss allowed on the sale of the stock within the recognition period is taken into account in determining recognized loss.) Assume that the $65 net unrealized built-in loss exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B).
(iv) Under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2)(iii), and (c) of this section, a loss recognized during the 5-year recognition period on an asset of P or S held on the day that P and S became members of the M group is a built-in loss except to the extent the group establishes that such loss exceeds the amount by which the adjusted basis of such asset on the day the member became a member exceeded the fair market value of such asset on that same day. If P sells asset 2 for $45 in Year 7 and recognizes a $10 loss, the entire $10 loss is treated as a built-in loss under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section. If S sells asset 3 for $10 in Year 7 and recognizes an $85 loss, the entire $85 loss is treated as a built-in loss under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section (not just the $55 balance of the P subgroup's $65 net unrealized built-in loss).
(v) The determination of whether P and S constitute a SRLY subgroup for purposes of loss carryovers and carrybacks, and the extent to which built-in losses are not allowed
under the SRLY limitation, is made under § 1.1502-21(c).

# Example 4. Computation of SRLY limitation.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300, and T sustains a $100 net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value to $100. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group with a net unrealized built-in loss of $100. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Assume that $100 exceeds the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 3, T recognizes its unrealized built-in loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The members of the P group contribute the following net income to the consolidated taxable income of the P group (disregarding T's recognized built-in loss and any consolidated net operating loss deduction under § 1.1502-21) for Years 3 and 4:
Year 3
Year 4
Total
P group (without T)
$100
$100
$200
T
60
40
100
CTI
160
140
300
(ii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, T's $100 ordinary loss in Year 3 (not taken into account in the consolidated taxable income computations above) is a built-in loss. Under paragraph (a) of this section, the built-in loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover for purposes of determining the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c).
(iii) For Year 3, § 1.1502-21(c) limits T's $100 built-in loss and $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 to the aggregate of the P group's consolidated taxable income through Year 3, determined by reference to only T's items. For this purpose, consolidated taxable income is determined without regard to any consolidated net operating loss deductions under § 1.1502-21(a).
(iv) The P group's consolidated taxable income through Year 3 is $60 when determined by reference to only T's items. Under § 1.1502-21(c), the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is therefore $60.
(v) Under paragraph (a) of this section, the $100 built-in loss is treated as a current deduction for all purposes other than determination of the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c). Consequently, a deduction for the built-in loss is allowed in Year 3 before T's loss carryover from Year 1 is allowed, but only to the extent of the $60 SRLY limitation. None of T's Year 1 loss carryover is allowed because the built-in loss ($100) exceeds the SRLY limitation for Year 3.
(vi) The $40 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation is treated as a $40 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is carried to other years in accordance with the rules of § 1.1502-21(b). The $40 net operating loss is treated under paragraph (a) of this section and § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii) as a loss carryover or carryback from Year 3 that arises in a SRLY, and is subject to the rules of § 1.1502-21 (including § 1.1502-21(c)) rather than this section. See also § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(iii)
Example 4.
(vii) The facts are the same as in paragraphs (i) through (vi) of this
Example 4,
except that T has an additional built-in loss when it joins the P group which is recognized in Year 4. For purposes of determining the SRLY limitation for this additional loss in Year 4 (or any subsequent year), the $60 of built-in loss allowed as a deduction in Year 3 is treated under paragraph (a) of this section as a deduction in Year 3 that reduces the P group's consolidated taxable income when determined by reference to only T's items.

# Example 5. Built-in loss exceeding consolidated taxable income in the year recognized.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and T. During Year 1, P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). At the time of acquisition, T has a noncapital asset with an unrealized loss of $45 (basis $100, value $55), which exceeds the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 2, T sells its asset for $55 and recognizes the unrealized built-in loss. The P group has $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2, computed by disregarding T's recognition of the $45 built-in loss and the consolidated net operating loss deduction, while the consolidated taxable income would be $25 if determined by reference to only T's items (other than the $45 loss).
(ii) T's $45 loss is recognized in Year 2 and, under paragraph (b) of this section, constitutes a built-in loss. Under paragraph (a) of this section and § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii), the loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover to Year 2 for purposes of applying the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c).
(iii) For Year 2, T's SRLY limitation is the aggregate of the P group's consolidated taxable income through Year 2 determined by reference to only T's items. For this purpose, consolidated taxable income is determined by disregarding any built-in loss that is treated as a net operating loss carryover, and any consolidated net operating loss deductions under § 1.1502-21(a). Consolidated taxable income so determined is $25.
(iv) Under § 1.1502-21(c), $25 of the $45 built-in loss could be deducted in Year 2. Because the P group has only $10 of consolidated taxable income (determined without regard to the $45), the $25 loss creates a consolidated net operating loss of $15. This loss is carried back or forward under the rules of § 1.1502-21(b) and absorbed under the rules of § 1.1502-21(a). This loss is not treated as arising in a
SRLY (see § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii)) and therefore is not subject to the SRLY limitation under § 1.1502-21(c) in any consolidated return year of the group to which it is carried. The remaining $20 is treated as a loss carryover arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation of § 1.1502-21(c) in the year to which it is carried.
(e)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation or member includes, as the context may require, a reference to a successor or predecessor, as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)(4).
(f)
Built-in losses recognized by common parent of group
—(1)
General rule.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any loss recognized by the group on an asset held by the common parent on the date the group is formed. Following an acquisition described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the corporation that was the common parent immediately before the acquisition.
(2)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If a corporation that becomes a common parent of a group acquires assets with a net unrealized built-in loss in excess of the threshold requirement of section 382(h)(3)(B) (and thereby increases its net unrealized built-in loss or decreases its net unrealized built-in gain) prior to, and in anticipation of, the formation of the group, paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply.
(g)
Overlap with section 382
—(1)
General rule.
The limitations provided in §§ 1.1502-21(c) and 1.1502-22(c) do not apply to recognized built-in losses or to loss carryovers or carrybacks attributable to recognized built-in losses when the application of paragraph (a) of this section results in an overlap with the application of section 382.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Generally.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382, the regulations thereunder, and §§ 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 apply.
(ii)
Overlap
—(A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (a) of this section and the application of section 382 with respect to built-in losses occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation that would apply with respect to the corporation's recognized built-in losses (the section 382 event). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, application of the overlap rule does not require that the size and composition of the corporation's net unrealized built-in loss is the same on the date of the section 382 event and the SRLY event.
(B) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup and/or a loss subgroup as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(2) with respect to built-in losses, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(3)
Operating rules
—(i)
Section 382 event before SRLY event.
If a SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 382 event or within the six month period beginning on the date of the section 382 event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax year that includes the SRLY event. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply, however, if a corporation that would otherwise be subject to the overlap rule acquires assets from a person other than a member of the group with a net unrealized built-in loss in excess of the threshold requirement of section 382(h)(3)(B) (and thereby increases its net unrealized built-in loss) after the section 382 event, and before the SRLY event.
(ii)
SRLY event before section 382 event.
If a section 382 event occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 382 event. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply at any time if a corporation that otherwise would be subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section transfers assets with an unrealized built-in loss to another member of the group after the SRLY event, but before the section 382 event, unless the corporation recognizes the built-in loss upon the transfer.
(4)
Subgroup rules.
In general, in the case of built-in losses for which there is a SRLY subgroup and the corporations joining the group at the time of the SRLY event also constitute a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(2)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However,
paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies with respect to built-in losses only if—
(i) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to those built-in losses are also included in a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(2)); and
(ii) All members of a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(2)) are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to those built-in losses.
(5)
Asset acquisitions.
Notwithstanding the application of this paragraph (g), paragraph (a) of this section applies to asset acquisitions by the corporation that occurs after the latter of the SRLY event and the section 382 event. See, paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Determination of subgroup.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, P1, and S. In Year 1, P acquires all of the stock of P1, and they file a consolidated return. In Year 3, P acquires all of the stock of S, and S joins the P group. Individual B, unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of M and K, each the common parent of a consolidated group. Individual C, unrelated to either Individual A or Individual B, owns all of the stock of T.
(ii) At the beginning of Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P from Individual A, and, as a result, P, P1, and S become members of the M group. At the time of M's acquisition of the P stock, P has a $15 net unrealized built-in loss (disregarding the stock of P1), P1 has a net unrealized built-in gain of $10, and S has a net unrealized built-in gain of $5.
(iii) During Year 8, M acquires all of the stock of T, and T joins the M group. At the time of M's acquisition of the T stock, T had an unrealized built-in loss of $15. At the beginning of Year 9, K acquires all of the stock of M from Individual B, and the members of the M consolidated group including P, P1, S, and T become members of the K group. At the time of K's acquisition of the M stock, M has (disregarding the stock of P and T) a $15 net unrealized built-in loss, P has a $20 net unrealized built-in loss (disregarding the stock of P1), P1 has a net unrealized built-in gain of $5, S has a net unrealized built-in loss of $35, and T has a $15 net unrealized built-in loss.
(iv) M's acquisition of P in Year 7 results in P, P1, and S becoming members of the M group (the SRLY event). Under paragraph (c) of this section, P and P1 compose a SRLY built-in loss subgroup because they have been affiliated for the 60 consecutive month period immediately preceding joining the M group. S is not a member of the subgroup because on becoming a member of the M group it had not been continuously affiliated with P and P1 for the 60 month period ending immediately before it became a member of the M group. Consequently, § 1.1502-15 applies to S separately from the P and P1 subgroup.
(v) Assuming that the $5 net unrealized built-in loss of the P/P1 subgroup exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B), M's acquisition of P resulted in an ownership change of P and P1 within the meaning of section 382(g) that subjects P and P1 to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event). Because, with respect to P and P1, the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date and because the loss subgroup and SRLY subgroup are coextensive, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.
(vi) S was not a loss corporation because it did not have a net operating loss carryover, or a net unrealized built-in loss, and therefore, M's acquisition of P did not result in an ownership change of S within the meaning of section 382(g). S, therefore is not subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section.
(vii) M's acquisition of T resulted in T becoming a member of the M group (the SRLY event). Assuming that T's $15 net unrealized built-in loss exceeds the threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B), M's acquisition of T also resulted in an ownership change of T within the meaning of section 382(g) that subjects T to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event). Because, with respect to T, the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section.
(viii) K's acquisition of M results in the members of the M consolidated group, including T, P, P1, and S, becoming members of the K group (the SRLY event). Because T, P, and P1 were each included in the determination of a net unrealized built-in loss that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when they each became members of the M group, they are deemed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to have been continuously affiliated with M for the 60 month period ending immediately before becoming a member of the M group, notwithstanding their actual affiliation history. As a result, M, T, P, and P1 compose a SRLY built-in loss subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. K's acquisition of M is not subject to paragraph (g) of this section because it does not result in a section 382 event.
(ix) S, however, is not a member of the subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because S was not included in the determination of a net unrealized built-in loss
that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when it joined the M group, S is treated as becoming an affiliate of M on the date it joined the M group. Furthermore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, S is deemed to have begun its affiliation with P and P1 on the date it joined the M group. Consequently, § 1.1502-15 applies to S separately to the extent its built-in loss is recognized within the recognition period.

# Example 2. Post-overlap acquisition of assets.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized built-in loss of $25 (basis $75, value $50), and asset 2 has an unrealized built-in gain of $20 (basis $30, value $50). During Year 3, P buys all of the stock of T from Individual B. On January 1, Year 4, P contributes $80 cash and Individual A contributes asset 3, a depreciable asset, with a net unrealized built-in loss of $45 (basis $65, value $20), in exchange for T stock in a transaction that is described in section 351.
(ii) P's acquisition of T results in T becoming a member of the P group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of T, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event).
(iii) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. Consequently, under paragraph (g) of this section, the limitation under paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to T's net unrealized built-in loss when it joined the P group.
(iv) Individual A's Year 4 contribution of a depreciable asset occurred after T was a member of the P group. Assuming that the amount of the net unrealized built-in loss exceeds the threshold requirement of section 382(h)(3)(B), the sale of asset 3 within the recognition period is subject to the SRLY limitation of paragraphs (a) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 3. Overlap rule.
(i) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of T. T has two depreciable assets. Asset 1 has an unrealized loss of $55 (basis $75, value $20), and asset 2 has an unrealized gain of $30 (basis $30, value $60). On February 28 of Year 2, P purchases 55% of T from Individual B. On June 30, of Year 2, P purchases an additional 35% of T from Individual B.
(ii) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation. The June 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
(iii) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382, and paragraph (a) of this section does not apply. Therefore, the SRLY limitation does not apply to any of the $55 loss in asset 1 recognized by T after T joined the P group. See § 1.1502-94 for rules relating to the application of section 382 with respect to T's $25 unrealized built-in loss.

# Example 4. Overlap rule-Fluctuation in value.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that by June 30, of Year 2, asset 1 had declined in value by a further $10. Thus asset 1 had an unrealized loss of $65 (basis $75, value $10), and asset 2 had an unrealized gain of $30 (basis $30, value $60).
(ii) Because paragraph (a) of this section does not apply, the further decrease in asset 1's value is disregarded. Consequently, the results are the same as in
Example 3.
(h)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section generally applies to built-in losses recognized in taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. However—
(i) In the event that paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(1) of this section do not apply to a particular built-in loss in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section to determine a limitation with respect to that built-in loss and with respect to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the member's (or subgroup's) items of income, gain, deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return was on or before June 25, 1999, paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall not apply; and
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 382(a) as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 applies shall constitute a section 382 event.
(2)
Prior periods.
For certain taxable years ending on or before June 25, 1999, see § 1.1502-15T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.

§ 1.1502-16
Mine exploration expenditures.
(a)
Section 617
—(1)
In general.
If the aggregate amount of the expenditures to which section 617(a) applies, paid or incurred with respect to mines or deposits located outside the United States (as defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder), does not exceed:
(i) $400,000 minus
(ii) All amounts deducted or deferred during the taxable year and all preceding taxable years under section 617 or section 615 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 by corporations which are members of the group during the taxable year (and individuals or corporations which have transferred any mineral property to any such member within the meaning of section 617(g)(2)(B)) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950 and prior to the taxable year, then the deduction under section 617 with respect to such foreign expenditures and paragraph (c) of § 1.1502-12 for each member shall be no greater than an allocable portion of such amount hereinafter referred to as the “consolidated foreign exploration limitation.” Such allocable portion shall be determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If the amount of such expenditures exceeds the consolidated foreign exploration limitation, no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such excess.
(2)
Allocable portion of limitation.
A member's allocable portion of the consolidated foreign exploration limitation for a consolidated return year shall be:
(i) The amount allocated by the common parent pursuant to an allocation plan adopted by the consolidated group, but in no event shall a member be allocated more than the amount it could have deducted had it filed a separate return. Such allocation plan must include a statement which also contains the total foreign exploration expenditures of each member which could have been deducted under section 617 if the member had filed a separate return. Such plan must be attached to a consolidated return filed on or before the due date of such return (including extensions of time), and may not be changed after such date, or
(ii) If no plan is filed in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, then the portion of the consolidated foreign exploration limitation allocable to each member incurring such expenditures is an amount equal to such limitation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of foreign exploration expenditures which could have been deducted under section 617 by such member had it filed a separate return and the denominator of which is the aggregate of such amounts for all members of the group.
(b)
Section 615
—(1)
In general.
If the aggregate amount of the expenditures, to which section 615(a) applies, which are paid or incurred by the members of the group during any consolidated return year exceeds the lesser of:
(i) $100,000, or
(ii) $400,000 minus all such expenditures deducted (or deferred) by corporations which are members of the group during the taxable year (and individuals or corporations which have transferred any mineral property to any such member within the meaning of section 615(c)(2)(B)) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950, and prior to the taxable year, then the deduction (or amount deferrable) under section 615 and paragraph (c) of § 1.1502-12 for each member shall be no greater than an allocable portion of such lesser amount, hereinafter referred to as the “consolidated exploration limitation”. Such allocable portion shall be determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Allocable portion of limitation.
A member's allocable portion of the consolidated exploration limitation for a consolidated return year shall be:
(i) The amount allocated by the common parent pursuant to an allocation plan adopted by the consolidated group, but in no event shall a member be allocated more than the amount it could have deducted (or deferred) had it filed a separate return. Such allocation plan must include a statement which also contains the total exploration expenditures of each member for the taxable year, and the expenditures of each member which could have been
deducted (or deferred) under section 615 if the member had filed a separate return. Such plan must be attached to a consolidated return filed on or before the due date of such return (including extensions of time), and may not be changed after such date, or
(ii) If no plan is filed in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, then the portion of the consolidated exploration limitation allocable to each member incurring such expenditures is an amount equal to such limitation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount which could have been deducted (or deferred) under section 615 by such member had it filed a separate return and the denominator of which is the aggregate of such amounts for all members of the group.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X and its wholly owned subsidiaries, corporations Y and Z, file a consolidated return for the calendar year 1971. None of the corporations have incurred exploration expenditures described in section 617 in previous years. During 1971, X incurred foreign exploration expenditures of $30,000, Y of $20,000, and Z of $40,000. The amount of foreign exploration expenditures deductible under section 617 for purposes of computing separate taxable income under § 1.1502-12 will be the amount actually expended by each corporation.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that prior to 1971, X, Y, and Z had deducted (or deferred) under section 615 and 617 a total of $300,000 of exploration expenditures. During 1971, with respect to deposits located outside the United States X incurred exploration expenditures of $25,000, Y of $75,000, and Z of $125,000. The consolidated exploration limitation under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the foreign deposits (there is no limitation with respect to the domestic expenditures) is $100,000. X may allocate the $100,000 in any manner among the three members, except that X may not be allocated more than $25,000 nor Y more than $75,000, the amount actually expended by X and Y and which they could have deducted had they each filed a separate return. If the allocation is not made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the $100,000 limitation will be allocated under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section as follows:
Corporation
Expenditure
Fraction

The denominator of $200,000 was calculated as follows:
X = $25,000
Y = $75,000
Z = $100,000 (maximum amount allowed if filed separately)
Total $200,000.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) and that on January 1, 1971, X acquired all of the stock of corporation T which prior to its taxable year beginning January 1, 1971, had previously deducted (or deferred) $310,000 of exploration expenditures. Assume further that in 1971 X incurred $25,000 of foreign exploration expenditures, Y $50,000, T $50,000, and Z none. A consolidated return is filed for 1971. None of the expenditures may be deducted under section 617 since the consolidated exploration limitation is zero. The limitation is zero since the aggregate amount of previously deducted (or deferred) exploration expenditures by the members of the group exceeds $400,000. (The total of such expenditures is $410,000, of which $310,000 is attributable to T and, assuming the allocation of the limitation in example (2) is made under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $12,500 is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y, and $50,000 to Z.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that on December 31, 1971, X sold all of the stock in Z to an unrelated party. The consolidated exploration limitation for 1972 will be $40,000, computed by subtracting from $400,000, the aggregate amount of previously deducted (or deferred) exploration expenditures incurred by the members of the group prior to 1972. (The total of such expenditures is $360,000, of which $12,500 is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y and $310,000 to T.) Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z are not taken into account since
it was not a member of the group at any time during 1972. Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z shall be taken into account by it for subsequent separate return years.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12949, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.1502-17
Methods of accounting.
(a)
General rule.
The method of accounting to be used by each member of the group is determined in accordance with the provisions of section 446 as if such member filed a separate return.
(b)
Adjustments required if method of accounting changes
—(1)
General rule.
If a member of a group changes its method of accounting for a consolidated return year, the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner under section 446(e), including section 481(a) where applicable, shall apply to the member. If the requirements of section 481(b) are met because applicable adjustments under section 481(a) are substantial, the increase in tax for any prior year shall be computed upon the basis of a consolidated return or a separate return, whichever was filed for such prior year.
(2)
Changes in method of accounting for intercompany transactions.
If a member changes its method of accounting for intercompany transactions for a consolidated return year, the change in method generally will be effected on a cut-off basis.
(c)
Anti-avoidance rules
—(1)
General rule.
If one member (B) directly or indirectly acquires an activity of another member (S), or undertakes S's activity, with the principal purpose to avail the group of an accounting method that would be unavailable (or would be unavailable without securing consent from the Commissioner) if S and B were treated as divisions of a single corporation, B must use the accounting method for the acquired or undertaken activity determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or must secure consent from the Commissioner under applicable administrative procedures to use a different method.
(2)
Treatment as divisions of a single corporation.
B must use the method of accounting that would be required if B acquired the activity from S in a transaction to which section 381 applied. Thus, the principles of section 381 (c)(4) and (c)(5) apply to resolve any conflicts between the accounting methods of S and B, and the acquired or undertaken activity is treated as having the accounting method used by S. Appropriate adjustments are made to treat all acquisitions or undertakings that are part of the same plan or arrangement as a single acquisition or undertaking.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Separate return treatment generally.
X and its wholly-owned subsidiary Y filed separate returns for their calendar years ending December 31, 1965. During calendar year 1965, X employed an accrual method of accounting, established a reserve for bad debts, and elected under section 171 to amortize bond premiums with respect to its fully taxable bonds. During calendar year 1965, Y employed the cash receipts and disbursements method, used the specific charge-off method with respect to its bad debts, and did not elect to amortize bond premiums under section 171 with respect to its bonds. X and Y filed a consolidated return for 1966. For 1966 X and Y must continue to compute income under their respective methods of accounting (unless a change in method under section 446 is made).

# Example 2. Adopting methods.
Corporation P is a member of a consolidated group. P provides consulting services to customers under various agreements. For one type of customer, P's agreements require payment only when the contract is completed (payment-on-completion contracts). P uses an overall accrual method of accounting. Accordingly, P takes its income from consulting contracts into account when earned, received, or due, whichever is earlier. With the principal purpose to avoid seeking the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting for the payment-on-completion contracts to the cash method, P forms corporation S, and S begins to render services to those customers subject to the payment-on-completion contracts. P continues to render services to those customers not subject to these contracts.
(b) Under paragraph (c) of this section, S must account for the consulting income under the payment-on-completion contracts on an accrual method rather than adopting the cash method contemplated by P.

# Example 3. Changing inventory sub-method.
(a) Corporation P is a member of a consolidated group. P operates a manufacturing business that uses dollar-value LIFO, and has built up a substantial LIFO reserve. P has historically manufactured all its inventory and has used one natural business unit
pool. P begins purchasing goods identical to its own finished goods from a foreign supplier, and is concerned that it must establish a separate resale pool under § 1.472-8(c). P anticipates that it will begin to purchase, rather than manufacture, a substantial portion of its inventory, resulting in a recapture of most of its LIFO reserve because of decrements in its manufacturing pool. With the principal purpose to avoid the decrements, P forms corporation S in Year 1. S operates as a distributor to nonmembers, and P sells all of its existing inventories to S. S adopts LIFO, and elects dollar-value LIFO with one resale pool. Thereafter, P continues to manufacture and purchase inventory, and to sell it to S for resale to nonmembers. P's intercompany gain from sales to S is taken into account under § 1.1502-13. S maintains its Year 1 base dollar value of inventory so that P will not be required to take its intercompany items (which include the effects of the LIFO reserve recapture) into account.
(b) Under paragraph (c) of this section, S must maintain two pools (manufacturing and resale) to the same extent that P would be required to maintain those pools under § 1.472-8 if it had not formed S.
(e)
Effective dates.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies to changes in method of accounting effective for years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply with respect to acquisitions occurring or activities undertaken in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995.
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36708, July 18, 1995; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106867, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-19
Excess loss accounts.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides rules for a member (M) to include in income its excess loss account in the stock of another member (S). The purpose of the excess loss account is to recapture in consolidated taxable income M's negative adjustments with respect to S's stock (e.g., under § 1.1502-32 from S's deductions, losses, and distributions), to the extent the negative adjustments exceed M's basis in the stock. This section also provides rules for eliminating losses and other attributes attributable to S in certain cases in which S stock becomes worthless or S ceases to be a member and does not have a separate return year.
(2)
Excess loss accounts
—(i)
In general.
M's basis in S's stock is adjusted under the consolidated return regulations and other rules of law. Negative adjustments may exceed M's basis in S's stock. The resulting negative amount is M's excess loss account in S's stock. For example:
(A) Once M's negative adjustments under § 1.1502-32 exceed its basis in S's stock, the excess is M's excess loss account in the S stock. If M has further adjustments, they first increase or decrease the excess loss account.
(B) If M forms S by transferring property subject to liabilities in excess of basis, § 1.1502-80(d) provides for the nonapplicability of section 357(c) and the resulting negative basis under section 358 is M's excess loss account in the S stock.
(ii)
Treatment as negative basis.
M's excess loss account is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as basis that is a negative amount, and a reference to M's basis in S's stock includes a reference to M's excess loss account.
(3)
Application of other rules of law, duplicative recapture.
See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments and recapture.
(b)
Excess loss account taken into account as income or gain
—(1)
Operating rules
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if M is treated under this section as disposing of a share of S's stock, M takes into account its excess loss account in the share as income or gain from the disposition.
(ii)
Special limitation on amount taken into account.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if M is treated as disposing of a share of S's stock as a result of the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the aggregate amount of its excess loss account in the shares of S's stock that M takes into account as income or gain from the disposition shall not exceed the amount of S's indebtedness that is discharged that is neither included in gross income nor treated as tax-exempt income under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
). If more than one share of S's stock has an excess loss account, such excess loss accounts shall be taken into account pursuant to the preceding sentence, to
the extent possible, in a manner that equalizes the excess loss accounts in S's shares that have an excess loss account.
(iii)
Treatment of disposition.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the disposition is treated as a sale or exchange for purposes of determining the character of the income or gain.
(iv)
Reduction of attributes in the case of certain dispositions by worthlessness or where S ceases to be a member and does not become a nonmember.
If this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) applies, any net operating or capital loss carryover that is attributable to S, including any losses that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2) if S had a separate return year, any deferred deductions attributable to S, including S's portion of such consolidated tax attributes (for example, consolidated excess charitable contributions that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-79(e) if S had a separate return year), and any credit carryover attributable to S, including any consolidated credits that would be apportioned to S under the principles of § 1.1502-79 if S had a separate return year, are eliminated. Attributes other than consolidated tax attributes (determined as of the disposition) are eliminated under this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) immediately before the disposition resulting in the application of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv). The elimination of attributes under this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) is not a noncapital, nondeductible expense described in § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). This paragraph (b)(1)(iv) applies if—
(A) A share of S stock becomes worthless under section 165, the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section are satisfied, M does not recognize a net deduction or loss on the S stock, and S is a member of the group on the day following the last day of the group's taxable year during which the share becomes worthless; or
(B) M recognizes any amount that is not a net deduction or loss on the stock of S in a transaction in which S ceases to be a member and does not become a nonmember.
(2)
Nonrecognition or deferral
—(i)
In general.
M's income or gain under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is subject to any nonrecognition or deferral rules applicable to the disposition. For example, if S liquidates and the exchange of M's stock in S is subject to section 332, or M transfers all of its assets (including S's stock) to S in a reorganization to which section 361(a) applies, M's income or gain from the excess loss account is not recognized under these rules.
(ii)
Nonrecognition or deferral inapplicable.
If M's income or gain under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is from a disposition described in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section (relating to deconsolidations and worthlessness), the income or gain is taken into account notwithstanding any nonrecognition or deferral rules (even if the disposition is also described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). For example, if M transfers S's stock to a nonmember in a transaction to which section 351 applies, M's income or gain from the excess loss account is taken into account.
(3)
Tiering up in chains.
If the stock of more than one subsidiary is disposed of in the same transaction, the income or gain under this section is taken into account in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to the highest.
(4)
Insolvency
—(i)
In general.
Gain under this section is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the amount by which S is insolvent (within the meaning of section 108(d)(3)) immediately before the disposition. For this purpose S's liabilities include any amount to which preferred stock would be entitled if S were liquidated immediately before the disposition, and any former liabilities that were discharged to the extent the discharge was treated as tax-exempt income under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C) (special rule for discharges).
(ii)
Reduction for amount of distributions.
The amount treated as ordinary income under this paragraph (b)(4) is reduced to the extent it exceeds the amount of M's excess loss account redetermined without taking into account S's distributions to M to which § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iv) applies.
(c)
Disposition of stock.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
In general.
M is treated as disposing of a share of S's stock:
(i)
Transfer, cancellation, etc.
At the time—
(A) M transfers or otherwise ceases to own the share for Federal income tax purposes, even if no gain or loss is taken into account; or
(B) M takes into account gain or loss (in whole or in part) with respect to the share.
(ii)
Deconsolidation.
At the time—
(A) M becomes a nonmember, or a nonmember determines its basis in the share (or any other asset) by reference to M's basis in the share, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part (e.g., under section 362); or
(B) S becomes a nonmember, or M's basis in the share is reflected, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in the basis of any asset other than member stock (e.g., under section 1071).
(iii)
Worthlessness.
At the time—
(A) All of S's assets (other than its corporate charter and those assets, if any, necessary to satisfy state law minimum capital requirements to maintain corporate existence) are treated as disposed of, abandoned, or destroyed for Federal income tax purposes (for example, under section 165(a) or § 1.1502-80(c), or, if S's asset is stock of a lower-tier member, the stock is treated as disposed of under this paragraph (c)). An asset of S is not considered to be disposed of or abandoned to the extent the disposition is in complete liquidation of S under section 332 or is in exchange for consideration (other than relief from indebtedness);
(B) An indebtedness of S is discharged, if any part of the amount discharged is not included in gross income and is not treated as tax-exempt income under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C); or
(C) A member takes into account a deduction or loss for the uncollectibility of an indebtedness of S, and the deduction or loss is not matched in the same tax year by S's taking into account a corresponding amount of income or gain from the indebtedness in determining consolidated taxable income.
(2)
Becoming a nonmember.
A member is treated as becoming a nonmember if it has a separate return year (including another group's consolidated return year). For example, S may become a nonmember if it issues additional stock to nonmembers, but S does not become a nonmember as a result of its complete liquidation. A disposition under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section must be taken into account in the consolidated return of the group. For example, if a group ceases under § 1.1502-75(c) to file a consolidated return as of the close of its consolidated return year, the disposition under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is treated as occurring immediately before the close of the year. If S becomes a nonmember because M sells S's stock to a nonmember, M's sale is a disposition under both paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. If a group terminates under § 1.1502-75(d) because the common parent is the only remaining member, the common parent is not treated as having a deconsolidation event under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Exception for acquisition of group
—(i)
Application.
This paragraph (c)(3) applies only if a consolidated group (the terminating group) ceases to exist as a result of—
(A) The acquisition of either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or
(B) The application of the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (d)(3).
(ii)
General rule.
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply solely by reason of the termination of a group in a transaction to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies, if there is a surviving group that is, immediately thereafter, a consolidated group. Instead, the surviving group is treated as the terminating group for purposes of applying this section to the terminating group. This treatment does not apply, however, to members of the terminating group that are not members of the surviving group immediately after the terminating group ceases to exist (e.g., under section 1504(a)(3) relating to reconsolidation, or section 1504(c) relating to includible insurance companies).
(d)
Special allocation of basis in connection with an adjustment or determination
—(1)
Excess loss account in original
shares.
If a member has an excess loss account in shares of a class of S's stock at the time of a basis adjustment or determination under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to shares of the same class of S's stock owned by the member, the adjustment or determination is allocated first to equalize and eliminate that member's excess loss account. See § 1.1502-32(c) for similar allocations of investment adjustments to prevent or eliminate excess loss accounts.
(2)
Excess loss account in new S shares.
If a member would otherwise determine shares of a class of S's stock (new shares) to have an excess loss account and such member owns one or more other shares of the same class of S's stock, the basis of such other shares is allocated to eliminate and equalize any excess loss account that would otherwise be in the new shares.
(e)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If any person acts with a principal purpose contrary to the purposes of this section, to avoid the effect of the rules of this section or apply the rules of this section to avoid the effect of any other provision of the consolidated return regulations, adjustments must be made as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.
(f)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation (or to a share of the corporation's stock) includes a reference to a successor or predecessor (or to a share of stock of a predecessor or successor), as the context may require.
(g)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, M owns all 100 shares of the only class of S's stock and S owns all 100 shares of the only class of T's stock, the stock is owned for the entire year, T owns no stock of lower-tier members, the tax year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Taxable disposition of stock.
(a)
Facts.
M has a $150 basis in S's stock, and S has a $100 basis in T's stock. For Year 1, M has $500 of ordinary income, S has no income or loss, and T has a $200 ordinary loss. S sells T's stock to a nonmember for $60 at the close of Year 1.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, the sale is a disposition of T's stock at the close of Year 1 (the day of the sale). Under § 1.1502-32(b), T's loss results in S having a $100 excess loss account in T's stock immediately before the sale. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S takes into account the $100 excess loss account as an additional $100 of gain from the sale. Consequently, S takes into account a $160 gain from the sale in determining the group's consolidated taxable income. Under § 1.1502-32(b), T's $200 loss and S's $160 gain result in a net $40 decrease in M's basis in S's stock as of the close of Year 1, from $150 to $110.
(c)
Intercompany sale followed by sale to nonmember.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that S sells T's stock to M for $60 at the close of Year 1, and M sells T's stock to a nonmember at a gain at the beginning of Year 5. Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's sale is treated as a disposition of T's stock at the close of Year 1 (the day of the sale). Under § 1.1502-13 and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's $160 gain from the sale is deferred and taken into account in Year 5 as a result of M's sale of the T stock. Under § 1.1502-32(b), the absorption of T's $200 loss in Year 1 results in M having a $50 excess loss account in S's stock at the close of Year 1. In Year 5, S's $160 gain taken into account eliminates M's excess loss account in S's stock and increases M's basis in the stock to $110.
(d)
Intercompany distribution followed by sale to a nonmember.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that the value of the T stock is $60 and S declares and distributes a dividend of all of the T stock to M at the close of Year 1, and M sells the T stock to a nonmember at a gain at the beginning of Year 5. Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's distribution is treated as a disposition of T's stock at the close of Year 1 (the day of the distribution). S's $100 excess loss account in T's stock is treated as additional gain under section 311(b) from the distribution. Under section 301(d), M's basis in the T stock is $60. Under § 1.1502-13, and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's $160 gain from the distribution is deferred and taken into account in Year 5 as a result of M's sale of the T stock. Under § 1.1502-32(b), T's $200 loss and S's $60 distribution result in M having a $110 excess loss account in S's stock at the close of Year 1. In Year 5, S's $160 gain taken into account eliminates M's excess loss account in S's stock and increases M's basis in the stock to $50.

# Example 2. Basis determinations under the Internal Revenue Code in intercompany reorganizations—transfer of shares without an excess loss account.
(i)
Facts.
M owns all of the sole class of stock of each of S and T. M has 150 shares of S stock that it acquired on Date 1. Each S share has a $1 basis and a fair market value of $1. M has 100 shares of T stock that it acquired on Date 2. Each T share has a $1.20 excess loss account and a fair market value of $1. M transfers S's stock to T without receiving additional T stock. The transfer is an exchange described in both section 351 and section 354.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under sections 351 and 354, M does not recognize gain in connection with the transfer. Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), M is deemed to receive 150 shares of T stock of the same class. Without regard to the application of paragraph (d) of this section, under section 358 and § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), M would have a $1 basis in each such share. However, because the basis of the additional shares of T stock will be determined when M has an excess loss account in its original shares of T stock, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the basis that M would otherwise have in such additional shares will eliminate the excess loss account in M's original shares of T stock such that each original share of T stock will have a basis of $0 and each share of T stock deemed received will have a basis of $0.20. Then, under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), the T stock is deemed to be recapitalized in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(E) in which M receives 100 shares of T stock (those shares M actually owns immediately after the transfer) in exchange for those 100 shares of T stock that M held immediately prior to the transfer and those 150 shares of T stock M is deemed to receive in the transfer. Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), immediately after the transfer, M holds 100 shares of T stock, 60 of which take a basis of $0.50 each and 40 of which take a basis of $0 each. In addition, T takes a $1 basis in each share of S stock under section 362. (If M had actually received an additional 150 shares of T stock of the same class, paragraph (d)(1) of this section would apply to shift basis from such additional T shares to M's original T shares because the basis of the additional T stock would be determined when M had an excess loss account in its original T shares. M would have a basis of $0 in each of the original T shares and a basis of $0.20 in each of the additional T shares.)
(iii)
Transfer of shares with an excess loss account.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that M transfers T's stock to S without receiving additional S stock. The transfer is an exchange described in both section 351 and section 354. Under paragraph (c) of this section, M's transfer is treated as a disposition of T's stock. Under sections 351 and 354 and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, M does not recognize gain from the disposition. Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), M is deemed to have received 100 shares of S stock of the same class. Without regard to the application of paragraph (d) of this section, M would have a $1.20 excess loss account in each such share. However, because M will have an excess loss account in such shares and M owns other shares of S stock of the same class, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the excess loss account that M would otherwise have in such shares will decrease M's basis in its original shares of S's stock such that each such original share will have a basis of $0.20 and each share deemed received will have a basis of $0. Then, under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iii), the S stock is deemed to be recapitalized in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(E) in which M receives 150 shares of S stock (those shares M actually owns immediately after the transfer) in exchange for those 150 shares of S stock that M held immediately prior to the transfer and those 100 shares of S stock that M is deemed to receive in connection with the transfer. Under § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), immediately after the transfer, M holds 150 shares of S stock, 90 of which take a basis of $0.33 each and 60 of which take a basis of $0 each. In addition, S takes an excess loss account of $1.20 in each share of T stock under section 362. (If M had actually received 100 additional shares of S stock of the same class, paragraph (d)(2) of this section would apply to shift basis from M's original S stock because M would have otherwise had an excess loss account in such additional shares and M owned other shares of S stock of the same class. The excess loss account that M would have otherwise had in such additional shares would have decreased M's basis in its original shares of S's stock. M would have had a basis of $0.20 in each of the original shares and a basis of $0 in each of the additional shares.)
(iv)
Intercompany merger—shares with excess loss account retained.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that S merges into T in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in section 368(a)(1)(D)), and M receives 150 additional shares of T stock of the same class in the reorganization. Under section 354, M does not recognize gain. Without regard to the application of paragraph (d) of this section, under section 358 and § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), M would have a $1 basis in each such share. However, because the basis of the additional shares of T stock will be determined when M has an excess loss account in its original shares of T stock, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the basis that M would otherwise have in such additional shares eliminates the excess loss account in M's original shares of T stock such that each original share of T stock has a basis of $0 and each additional share of T stock has a basis of $0.20.
(v)
Intercompany merger—shares with excess loss account surrendered.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that T merges into S in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) (and in
section 368(a)(1)(D)), and M receives 100 additional shares of S stock of the same class in the reorganization. Under section 354 and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, M does not recognize gain from the disposition. Without regard to the application of paragraph (d) of this section, under section 358 and § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), M would have a $1.20 excess loss account in each additional share of S stock received. However, because M would have an excess loss account in such shares and M owns other shares of S stock of the same class, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the excess loss account that M would otherwise have in such shares decreases M's basis in its original shares of S's stock such that each original share of S stock has a basis of $0.20 and each additional share of S stock has a basis of $0.

# Example 3. Section 355 distribution of stock with an excess loss account.
(a)
Facts.
M has a $30 excess loss account in S's stock, and S has a $90 excess loss account in T's stock. S distributes the T stock to M in a transaction to which section 355 applies, and neither M nor S recognizes any gain or loss. At the time of the distribution, the T stock represents 33% of the value of the S stock. Following the distribution, M's basis in the S stock is allocated under § 1.358-2 in proportion to the fair market values of the S stock and the T stock.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's distribution of the T stock is treated as a disposition. Under section 355(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S does not recognize any gain from the distribution. Under section 358, S's excess loss account in the T stock is eliminated, and M's $30 excess loss account in the S stock is treated as basis allocated between the S stock and the T stock based on their relative values. Consequently, M has a $20 excess loss account in the S stock and a $10 excess loss account in the T stock. (If M had a $30 basis rather than a $30 excess loss account in the S stock, S would not recognize gain, its excess loss account in the T stock would be eliminated, and M's basis in the stock of S and T would be $20 and $10, respectively.)
(c)
Section 355 distribution to nonmember.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 3,
except that M also distributes the T stock to its shareholders in a transaction to which section 355 applies. Under paragraph (c) of this section, M's distribution is treated as a disposition of T's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, because M's disposition is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, M's $10 excess loss account in the T stock must be taken into account at the time of the distribution, notwithstanding the nonrecognition rules of section 355(c).

# Example 4. Deconsolidation of a member.
(a)
Facts.
M has a $50 excess loss account in S's stock, and S has a $100 excess loss account in T's stock. T issues additional stock to a nonmember and, as a consequence, T becomes a nonmember.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S is treated as disposing of each of its shares of T's stock immediately before T becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S takes into account its $100 excess loss account as gain from the sale or exchange of T's stock. Under § 1.1502-32(b) of this section, S's $100 gain eliminates M's excess loss account in S's stock and increases M's basis in S's stock to $50.
(c)
Deconsolidation of a higher-tier member.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 4,
except that S (rather than T) issues the stock and, as a consequence, both S and T become nonmembers. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, M is treated as disposing of S's stock and S is treated as disposing of T's stock immediately before S and T become nonmembers. Under § 1.1502-32(b) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section, because S and T become nonmembers in the same transaction and T is the lower-tier member, S is first treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as taking into account its $100 excess loss account as gain from the sale or exchange of T's stock. Under § 1.1502-32(b), S's $100 gain eliminates M's excess loss account in S's stock and increases M's basis in S's stock to $50 immediately before S becomes a nonmember. Thus, only S's $100 gain is taken into account in the determination of the group's consolidated taxable income.
(d)
Intercompany gain and deconsolidation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c) of this
Example 4,
except that T has $30 of gain that is deferred under § 1.1502-13 and taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income immediately before T becomes a nonmember. Under § 1.1502-32(b), T's $30 gain decreases S's excess loss account in T's stock from $100 to $70 immediately before S is treated as disposing of T's stock. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S is treated as taking into account its $70 excess loss account as gain from the disposition of T's stock. Under § 1.1502-32(b), S's $70 gain from the excess loss account and T's $30 deferred gain that is taken into account eliminate M's $50 excess loss account in S's stock and increase M's basis in S's stock to $50 immediately before S becomes a nonmember.

# Example 5. Worthlessness.
(a)
Facts.
M forms S with a $150 contribution, and S borrows $150. For Year 1, S has a $50 ordinary loss that is carried over as part of the group's consolidated net operating loss. For Year 2, M has $160 of ordinary income, and S has a $160 ordinary loss. Under § 1.1502-32(b), S's loss results in M having a $10 excess loss account in S's stock. During Year 3, the value of S's assets (without taking S's liabilities into account) continues to decline and S's stock becomes worthless within the meaning
of section 165(g) (without taking into account § 1.1502-80(c)). For Year 4, S has $10 of ordinary income.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, M is not treated as disposing of S's stock in Year 3 solely because S's stock becomes worthless within the meaning of section 165(g) (taking S's liabilities into account). In addition, because S's stock is not treated as worthless, section 382(g)(4)(D) does not prevent the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss carryover from offsetting S's $10 of income in Year 4.
(c)
Discharge of indebtedness.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 5,
except that, instead of S's stock becoming worthless within the meaning of section 165(g), S's creditor discharges $40 of S's indebtedness during Year 3, S is insolvent by more than $40 before the discharge, the discharge is excluded from the M group's gross income under section 108(a), and $40 of the $50 consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S is eliminated under section 108(b). Under § 1.1502- 32(b)(3)(ii)(C), S's $40 of discharge income is treated as tax-exempt income because there is a corresponding decrease under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii) for elimination of the loss carryover. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, M is treated as disposing of S's stock if the amount discharged is not included in gross income and is not treated as tax-exempt income under § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(ii)(C). Because the discharge is treated as tax-exempt income, M is not treated as disposing of S's stock by reason of the discharge.

# Example 6. Avoiding worthlessness.
(a)
Facts.
M forms S with a $100 contribution and S borrows $150. For Years 1 through 5, S has a $210 ordinary loss that is absorbed by the group. Under § 1.1502-32(b), S's loss results in M having a $110 excess loss account in S's stock. S defaults on the indebtedness, but the creditor does not discharge the debt (or initiate collection procedures). At the beginning of Year 6, S ceases any substantial operations with respect to the assets, but maintains their ownership with a principal purpose to avoid M's taking into account its excess loss account in S's stock.
(b)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, M's excess loss account on each of its shares of S's stock ordinarily is taken into account at the time substantially all of S's assets are treated as disposed of, abandoned, or destroyed for Federal income tax purposes. Under paragraph (e) of this section, however, S's assets are not taken into account at the beginning of Year 6 for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Consequently, S is treated as worthless at the beginning of Year 6, and M's $110 excess loss account is taken into account.
(h)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
Application.
This section applies with respect to determinations of the basis of (including an excess loss account in) the stock of a member in consolidated return years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section to transactions that occurred prior to September 17, 2008. Any such determination or redetermination does not, however, affect any prior period. Paragraphs (a)(3), (c)(1)(iii)(A), and (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section apply with respect to determinations and transactions occurring on or after September 17, 2008. However, taxpayers may elect to apply paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section to transactions that occurred prior to September 17, 2008. The last sentence of paragraph (a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section applies with respect to dispositions on or after December 16, 2008.
(2)
Dispositions of stock
—(i)
Dispositions of stock before effective date.
If M was treated as disposing of stock of S in a tax year beginning before January 1, 1995 (including, for example, a deemed disposition because S was worthless) under the rules of this section then in effect, the amount of M's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the stock basis reflected in that amount, are not redetermined under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the applicable rules.
(ii)
Application of special limitation.
If M was treated as disposing of stock of S because S was treated as worthless as a result of the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section after August 29, 2003, the amount of M's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the stock basis reflected in that amount, are determined or redetermined with regard to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If M was treated as disposing of stock of S because S was treated as worthless as a result of the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section on or before August 29, 2003, the group may determine or redetermine the amount of M's income, gain, deduction, or loss, and the stock basis reflected in that amount with regard to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Intercompany amounts.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(2), a disposition does not include a transaction to which § 1.1502-13, § 1.1502-13T, § 1.1502-14, or § 1.1502-14T applies. Instead, the transaction is deemed to occur as the income, gain, deduction, or loss (if any) is taken into account.
(iv)
Intercompany reorganizations.
Paragraphs (d) and (g)
Example 2
of this section apply to transactions occurring on or after July 18, 2007. For transactions occurring on or after January 23, 2006, and before July 18, 2007, see § 1.1502-19T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect April 1, 2007. For transactions occurring before January 23, 2006, see § 1.1502-19 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect April 1, 2005.
(3)
Prior law.
For prior determinations, see prior regulations under section 1502 as in effect with respect to the determination. See, e.g., § 1.1502-19 as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994.

# Computation of Consolidated Items
§ 1.1502-21
Net operating losses.
(a)
Consolidated net operating loss deduction
—(1)
In general.
Subject to any limitations under the Internal Revenue Code or this chapter (for example, the limitations under section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the consolidated net operating loss deduction (or CNOL deduction) for any consolidated return year is the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the year. The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks consist of—
(i) Any CNOLs (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) of the consolidated group; and
(ii) Any net operating losses (or NOLs) of the members arising in separate return years.
(2)
Application of section 172 for computing net operating loss deductions
—(i)
Overview.
For purposes of § 1.1502-11(a)(2) (regarding a CNOL deduction), the rules of section 172 regarding the use of net operating losses are taken into account as provided by this paragraph (a)(2) in calculating the consolidated taxable income of a group for a particular consolidated return year. More specifically, in computing taxable income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(a) generally limits the deductibility of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOLs). However, these limitations do not apply to net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (pre-2018 NOLs). Therefore, in any particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, the group's CNOL deduction includes CNOLs arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (pre-2018 CNOLs), without limitation under section 172(a). Following the deduction of pre-2018 CNOLs, this paragraph (a)(2) applies to compute the maximum amount of CNOLs from taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 CNOLs), that can be deducted against taxable income in a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020 (post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). See section 172(a)(2)(A) and (B).
(ii)
Computation of the 80-percent limitation and special rule for nonlife insurance companies
—(A)
Determinations based on status of group members.
If a portion of a post-2017 CNOL is carried back or carried over to a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, whether the members of the group include nonlife insurance companies, other types of corporations, or both determines whether section 172(a) (including the limitation described in section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (80-percent limitation)), section 172(f) (providing special rules for nonlife insurance companies), or both, apply to the group for the consolidated return year.
(B)
Determination of post-2017 CNOL deduction limit.
The post-2017 CNOL deduction limit is determined under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by applying section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (that is, the 80-percent limitation), section 172(f) (that is, the special rule for nonlife insurance companies), or both, to the group's consolidated taxable income for that year.
(C)
Inapplicability of 80-percent limitation.
The 80-percent limitation does not apply to CNOL deductions taken in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, or to CNOLs arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (that is, pre-2018 CNOLs). See section 172(a).
(iii)
Computations under sections 172(a)(2)(B) and 172(f).
This paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides rules for applying sections 172(f) and 172(a)(2)(B) to consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 2020 (that is, for computing the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). Section 172(f) applies to income of nonlife insurance company members, whereas section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies to income of members that are not nonlife insurance companies. Thus, this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) provides specific rules for groups with no nonlife insurance company members, only nonlife insurance company members, or a combination of nonlife insurance company members and other members. For groups with both nonlife insurance company members and life insurance company members, see paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(E) of this section.
(A)
Groups without nonlife insurance company members.
If no member of a group is a nonlife insurance company during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii) (that is, the 80-percent limitation) applies to all income of the group for that year. Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year is the lesser of—
(
1
) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year; or
(
2
) The amount determined by multiplying—
(
i
) 80 percent, by
(
ii
) Consolidated taxable income for the group for that year (determined without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250) less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year.
(B)
Groups comprised solely of nonlife insurance companies.
If a group is comprised solely of nonlife insurance companies during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, section 172(f) applies to all income of the group for that year. Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year equals the lesser of—
(
1
) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or
(
2
) Consolidated taxable income less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year.
(C)
Groups that include both nonlife insurance companies and other corporations
—(
1
)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
5
) of this section, if a group has at least one member that is a nonlife insurance company and at least one member that is not a nonlife insurance company during a particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for that year equals the lesser of—
(
i
) The aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or
(
ii
) The sum of the amounts in the income pools determined under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section.
(
2
)
Residual income pool.
The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) (residual income pool) is eighty percent of the excess of—
(
i
) The consolidated taxable income of the group for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, determined without regard to any income, gain, deduction, or loss of members that are nonlife insurance companies and without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250, over
(
ii
) The aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year that are allocated to this income pool under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
4
) of this section (that is, by applying the 80-percent limitation). See section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii).
(
3
)
Nonlife income pool.
The amount determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
3
) (nonlife income pool) is
the consolidated taxable income of the group for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, determined without regard to any income, gain, deduction, or loss of members included in the computation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year that are allocated to this income pool under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
4
) of this section. See section 172(f).
(
4
)
Pro rata allocation of pre-2018 NOLs between pools of income.
For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section, the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to any particular consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020, is prorated between the residual income pool and the nonlife income pool based on the relative amounts of positive income of those two pools. For example, if $30 of pre-2018 NOLs is carried over to a consolidated return year in which the residual income pool contains $75 and the nonlife income pool contains $150, the residual income pool is allocated $10 of the pre-2018 NOLs ($30 × $75/($75 + $150), or $30 ×
1/3
), and the nonlife income pool is allocated the remaining $20 of pre-2018 NOLs ($30 × $150/($75 + $150), or $30 ×
2/3
).
(
5
)
Exception.
The post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year is determined under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
5
) if the amounts computed under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section for that year are not both positive.
(
i
)
Positive residual income pool and negative nonlife income pool.
This paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
5
)(
i
) applies if the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section for the residual income pool is positive and the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section for the nonlife income pool is negative. If this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
5
)(
i
) applies, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or 80 percent of the consolidated taxable income of the entire group (determined without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250) after subtracting the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year (that is, by applying the 80-percent limitation). See section 172(a)(2)(B).
(
ii
)
Positive nonlife income pool and negative residual income pool.
If the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section for the nonlife income pool is positive and the amount computed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section for the residual income pool is negative, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for a consolidated return year equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to that year, or the consolidated taxable income of the entire group less the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to that year. See section 172(f).
(b)
Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to consolidated return and separate return years.
Net operating losses of members arising during a consolidated return year are taken into account in determining the group's CNOL under paragraph (e) of this section for that year. Losses taken into account in determining the CNOL may be carried to other taxable years (whether consolidated or separate) only under this paragraph (b).
(1)
Carryovers and carrybacks generally.
The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the principles of, and are subject to any limitations under, section 172 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to be absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they arose, and losses carried from taxable years ending on the same date, and which are available to offset consolidated taxable income for the year, generally are absorbed on a pro rata basis. In addition, except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of any CNOL absorbed by the group in any year is apportioned among members based on the percentage of the CNOL eligible for carryback or carryover that is attributable to each member as of the beginning of the year. The percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Additional
rules provided under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply. See, for example, section 382(l)(2)(B) (if losses are carried from the same taxable year, losses subject to limitation under section 382 are absorbed before losses that are not subject to limitation under section 382). See paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, (Example 2), for an illustration of pro rata absorption of losses subject to a SRLY limitation.
(2)
Carryovers and carrybacks of CNOLs to separate return years
—(i)
In general.
If any CNOL that is attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year of the member, the amount of the CNOL that is attributable to the member is apportioned to the member (apportioned loss) and carried to the separate return year. If carried back to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried back to an equivalent, or earlier, consolidated return year of the group; if carried over to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried over to an equivalent, or later, consolidated return year of the group.
(ii)
Special rules
—(A)
Year of departure from group.
If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, net operating loss carryovers attributable to the corporation are first carried to the consolidated return year, then are subject to reduction under section 108 and § 1.1502-28 (regarding discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a)), and then are subject to reduction under § 1.1502-36 (regarding transfers of loss shares of subsidiary stock). Only the amount that is neither absorbed by the group in that year nor reduced under section 108 and § 1.1502-28 or under § 1.1502-36 may be carried to the corporation's first separate return year. For rules concerning a member departing a subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.
(B)
Offspring rule.
In the case of a member that has been a member continuously since its organization (determined without regard to whether the member is a successor to any other corporation), the CNOL attributable to the member is included in the carrybacks to consolidated return years before the member's existence. If the group did not file a consolidated return for a carryback year, the loss may be carried back to a separate return year of the common parent under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, but only if the common parent was not a member of a different consolidated group or of an affiliated group filing separate returns for the year to which the loss is carried or any subsequent year in the carryback period. Following an acquisition described in § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the corporation that was the common parent immediately before the acquisition.
(iii)
Equivalent years.
Taxable years are equivalent if they bear the same numerical relationship to the consolidated return year in which a CNOL arises, counting forward or backward from the year of the loss. For example, in the case of a member's third taxable year (which was a separate return year) that preceded the consolidated return year in which the loss arose, the equivalent year is the third consolidated return year preceding the consolidated return year in which the loss arose. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for certain short taxable years that are disregarded in making this determination.
(iv)
Operating rules.
(A)
Amount of CNOL attributable to a member.
The amount of a CNOL that is attributable to a member equals the product obtained by multiplying the CNOL and the percentage of the CNOL attributable to the member.
(B)
Percentage of CNOL attributable to a member
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section, the percentage of the CNOL for the consolidated return year attributable to a member equals the separate net operating loss of the member for the consolidated return year divided by the sum of the separate net operating losses for that year of all members having such losses for that year. For this purpose, the separate net operating loss of a member is determined by computing the CNOL by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including the member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the consolidated return year (whether
or not absorbed by the member). The source and section 904(d) separate category of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined under § 1.1502-4(c)(1)(iii).
(
2
)
Recomputed percentage.
If, for any reason, a member's portion of a CNOL is absorbed or reduced on a non-pro rata basis (for example, under § 1.1502-11(b) or (c), paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, § 1.1502-28, or 1.1502-36(d), or as the result of a carryback to a separate return year), the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member is recomputed. In addition, if a member with a separate net operating loss ceases to be a member, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each remaining member is recomputed. The recomputed percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member equals the remaining CNOL attributable to the member at the time of the recomputation divided by the sum of the remaining CNOL attributable to all of the remaining members at the time of the recomputation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
), a CNOL that is permanently disallowed or eliminated is treated as absorbed.
(C)
Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks
—(
1
)
General rules.
Subject to the rules regarding allocation of special status losses under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section—
(
i
)
Nonlife insurance companies.
The portion of a CNOL attributable to any members of the group that are nonlife insurance companies is carried back or carried over under the rules in section 172(b) applicable to nonlife insurance companies.
(
ii
)
Corporations other than nonlife insurance companies.
The portion of a CNOL attributable to any other members of the group is carried back or carried over under the rules in section 172(b) applicable to corporations other than nonlife insurance companies.
(
2
)
Recomputed percentage.
For rules governing the recomputation of the percentage of a CNOL attributable to each remaining member if any portion of the CNOL attributable to a member is carried back under section 172(b)(1)(B) or (C) and absorbed on a non-pro rata basis, see paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(D)
Allocation of special status losses.
The amount of the group's CNOL that is determined to constitute a farming loss (as defined in section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii)) or any other net operating loss that is subject to special carryback or carryover rules (special status loss) is allocated to each member separately from the remainder of the CNOL based on the percentage of the CNOL attributable to the member, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. This allocation is made without regard to whether a particular member actually incurred specific expenses or engaged in specific activities required by the special status loss provisions. This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) applies only with regard to losses for which the special carryback or carryover rules are dependent on the type of expense generating the loss, rather than on the special status of the entity to which the loss is allocable. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section (applicable to losses of nonlife insurance companies). This paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) does not apply to farming losses incurred by a consolidated group in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021.
(E)
Coordination with rules for life-nonlife groups under § 1.1502-47.
For groups that include at least one member that is a life insurance company and for which an election is in effect under section 1504(c)(2), any computation of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section is computed only with respect to items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the nonlife subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-47(b)(9)). For rules regarding the use of CNOLs of the nonlife subgroup to offset life insurance company taxable income of the life subgroup (each as defined in § 1.1502-47(b)), or the use of CNOLs of the life subgroup to offset consolidated taxable income of the nonlife subgroup, see generally section 1503(c)(1) and § 1.1502-47.
(v)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (b)(2)(v), unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable years, all losses are farming losses within the meaning
of section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii), all taxable years begin after December 31, 2020, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1: Offspring rule.
(
1
) During Year 1, Individual A forms P and T, and they each file a separate return. P forms S on March 15 of Year 2, and P and S file a consolidated return. P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change within the meaning of section 382. P, S, and T sustain a $1,100 CNOL in Year 3 and, under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable $200 to P, $300 to S, and $600 to T.
(
2
) Of the $1,100 CNOL in Year 3, the $500 amount of the CNOL that is attributable to P and S ($200 + $300) may be carried to P's separate return in Year 1. Even though S was not in existence in Year 1, the $300 amount of the CNOL attributable to S may be carried back to P's separate return in Year 1 because S (unlike T) has been a member of the P group since its organization and P is a qualified parent under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's return in Year 2. The $600 amount of the CNOL attributable to T is a net operating loss carryback to T's separate return in Year 1, and if not absorbed in Year 1, then to Year 2.
(B)
Example 2: Departing members.
(
1
) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, on June 15 of Year 4, P sells all the stock of T. The P group's consolidated return for Year 4 includes the income of T through June 15. T files a separate return for the period from June 16 through December 31.
(
2
) $600 of the Year 3 CNOL attributable to T is apportioned to T and is carried back to its separate return in Year 1. To the extent the $600 is not absorbed in T's separate return in Year 1 or Year 2, it is carried to the consolidated return in Year 4 before being carried to T's separate return in Year 4. Any portion of the loss not absorbed in T's Year 1 or Year 2 or in the P group's Year 4 is then carried to T's separate return in Year 4.
(C)
Example 3. Offspring rule following acquisition.
(
1
) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T. P acquires all of the stock of T at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $200 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2, and $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 3 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). At the beginning of Year 4, T forms a subsidiary, Y, in a transaction described in section 351. The P group has a $300 consolidated net operating loss in Year 4, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to Y.
(
2
) Even though Y was not in existence in Year 2, $300, the amount of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to Y, may be carried back to the P group's Year 2 consolidated return under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because Y has been a member of the P group since its organization. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's consolidated return in Year 3.
(D)
Example 4: Allocation of a CNOL arising in a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020.
(
1
) P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes S. Neither P nor S is a nonlife insurance company. The P group also includes nonlife insurance companies PC1, PC2, and PC3. In the P group's 2021 consolidated return year, all members except S have separate net operating losses, and the P group's CNOL in that year is $40. No member of the P group engages in farming activities. See section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii).
(
2
) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section, for purposes of carrying losses to other taxable years, the P group's $40 CNOL is allocated pro rata among the group members that have separate net operating losses. Under paragraph
(b)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, those respective portions of the CNOL attributable to PC1, PC2, and PC3 (that is, members that are nonlife insurance companies) are carried back to each of the two preceding taxable years and then carried over to each of the 20 subsequent taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(C). The portion attributable to P (which is not a nonlife insurance company) may not be carried back but is carried over to future years. See section 172(b)(1)(A).
(E)
Example 5: Allocation of a CNOL arising in a consolidated return year beginning before January 1, 2021.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)(
1
) of this section, except that the P group incurred the CNOL during the P group's 2020 consolidated return year. The allocation among the P group members of the CNOL described in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D)(
2
) of this section would be the same. However, those respective portions of the CNOL attributable to PC1, PC2, and PC3 (that is, members that are nonlife insurance companies) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to each of the 20 subsequent taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(C) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i). The portion attributable to P (which is not a nonlife insurance company) will be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years and then carried over to future years. See section 172(b)(1)(A) and section 172(b)(1)(D)(i).
(F)
Example 6: CNOL deduction and application of section 172.
(
1
) P (a type of corporation other than a nonlife insurance company) is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes PC1 (a nonlife insurance company). P and PC1 were both incorporated in Year 1 (a year beginning after December 31, 2020). In Year 1, P and PC1 have separate taxable income of $20 and $25, respectively. As a result, the P group has Year 1 consolidated taxable income of $45. In Year 2, P has separate taxable income of $24, and PC1 has a separate taxable loss of $40, resulting in a P group CNOL of $16. Additionally, in Year 3, P has separate taxable income of $15, and PC1 has a separate taxable loss of $45, resulting in a P group CNOL of $30. No member of the P group engages in farming activities. See section 172(b)(1)(B)(ii).
(
2
) Under paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the P group's Year 2 CNOL and Year 3 CNOL are entirely attributable to PC1, a nonlife insurance company. Therefore, under section 172(b)(1)(C)(i), the entire amount of each of these CNOLs is eligible to be carried back to Year 1.
(
3
) Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of the Year 2 CNOL that may be used by the P group in Year 1 is determined by taking into account the status (nonlife insurance company or other type of corporation) of the member that has separate taxable income composing in whole or in part the P group's consolidated taxable income. Because the P group includes both a nonlife insurance company member and a member that is not a nonlife insurance company, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section applies to determine the computation of the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for the group for Year 1. Therefore, the 80-percent limitation is applied to the residual income pool, which consists of the taxable income of P, a type of corporation other than a nonlife insurance company. Under the 80-percent limitation, the maximum amount of P's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's post-2017 CNOLs is $16, which equals 80 percent of the excess of P's taxable income for Year 1 ($20) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs allocable to P ($0) (80 percent × ($20−$0)). See paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) and (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
4
) of this section. PC1 is a nonlife insurance company to which section 172(f), rather than the 80-percent limitation in section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii), applies. Therefore, the maximum amount of PC1's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's post-2017 CNOLs is $25, which equals the excess of PC1's taxable income for Year 1 ($25) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs allocable to PC1 ($0). See paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C)(
3
) and (
4
) of this section.
(
4
) Based on paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section and the analysis set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)(
3
) of this section, at the end of Year 2, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of the aggregate
amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1 ($16), or $41 ($16 + $25). Therefore, the P group can offset $16 of its Year 1 income with its CNOL carryback from Year 2.
(
5
) When the Year 3 CNOL is carried back to Year 1, the P group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for Year 1 is the lesser of $46 (the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to Year 1) or $41 ($16 + $25; see the computation in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F)(
3
) of this section). Thus, the total amount of the P group's Year 1 income that may be offset by the P group's Year 2 and Year 3 CNOLs is $41 ($16 from Year 2 + $25 from Year 3). As a result, the P group reports $4 of income ($45−$41) in Year 1 that is ineligible for offset by any other NOLs. The P group carries over its remaining $5 CNOL ($46−$41) to future years.

Example 7: Pre-2018 and post-2017 CNOLs.
(

) P is the common parent of a consolidated group. No member of the P group is a nonlife insurance company or is engaged in a farming business, and no member of the P group has a loss that is subject to a SRLY limitation. The P group had the following consolidated taxable income or CNOL for the following taxable years:

(

) Under section 172(a)(1), all $30 of the P group's 2018 consolidated taxable income is offset by the 2017 CNOL carryover without limitation. The remaining $60 of the P group's 2017 CNOL is carried over to 2021 under section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I).
(
3
) Under section 172(b)(1)(D)(i)(I), the P group's $40 2019 CNOL is carried back to the five taxable years preceding the year of the loss. Thus, the P group's $40 2019 CNOL is carried back to offset $40 of its 2014 consolidated taxable income.
(
4
) Under section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 plus the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit. The P group has $60 of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($90−$30). Because no member of the P group is a nonlife insurance company, paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section applies to determine the computation of the group's post-2017 CNOL deduction limit for 2021. See also section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, the post-2017 CNOL deduction limit of the P group for 2021 is $48, which equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of post-2017 NOLs carried to 2021 ($100), or 80 percent of the excess of the P group's consolidated taxable income for that year computed without regard to any deductions under sections 172, 199A, and 250 ($120) over the aggregate amount of pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 ($60) (that is, 80 percent × $60). Thus, the P group's CNOL deduction for 2021 equals $108 ($60 pre-2018 NOLs carried to 2021 + $48 post-2017 CNOL deduction limit). See section 172(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The P group offsets $108 of its $120 of 2021 consolidated taxable income, resulting in $12 of consolidated taxable income in 2021. The remaining $52 of the P group's 2020 CNOL ($100−$48) is carried over to future taxable years. See section 172(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II).

Election to relinquish entire carryback period
—(i)
In general.
A group may make an irrevocable election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a CNOL for any consolidated return year. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the election may not be made separately for any member (whether or not it remains a member), and must be made in a separate statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-21(b)(3)(i) TO WAIVE THE ENTIRE CARRYBACK PERIOD PURSUANT TO SECTION 172(b)(3) FOR THE [insert consolidated return year] CNOLs OF THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF WHICH [insert name and employer identification number of common parent] IS THE COMMON PARENT.” The statement must be filed with the group's income
tax return for the consolidated return year in which the loss arises. The election may be made in an unsigned statement.
(ii)
Groups that include insolvent financial institutions.
For rules applicable to relinquishing the entire carryback period with respect to losses attributable to insolvent financial institutions,
see
§ 301.6402-7 of this chapter.
(4)
General split-waiver election.
If one or more members of a consolidated group becomes a member of another consolidated group, the acquiring group may make an irrevocable election to relinquish, with respect to all consolidated net operating losses attributable to the member, the portion of the carryback period for which the corporation was a member of another group, provided that any other corporation joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the member immediately before it joined the acquiring group is also included in the waiver. This election is not a yearly election and applies to all losses that would otherwise be subject to a carryback to a former group under section 172. The election must be made in a separate statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-21(b)(4) TO WAIVE THE PRE- [insert first taxable year for which the member (or members) was not a member of another group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLs attributable to [insert names and employer identification number of members].” The statement must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's original income tax return for the year the corporation (or corporations) became a member. The election may be made in an unsigned statement.
(5)

Extended split-waiver election.
An extended split-waiver election must be made in a separate extended split-waiver election statement titled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 1.1502-21(b)(5)(i) TO WAIVE THE PRE-[insert first day of the first taxable year for which the acquired member was a member of the acquiring group] EXTENDED CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE [insert taxable year of losses] TAXABLE YEAR(S) OF [insert names and employer identification numbers of members]”. The extended split-waiver election statement must be filed as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section.
(vi)
Time and manner for filing statement
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B) or (C) of this section, an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement must be filed with the acquiring group's timely filed consolidated return (including extensions) for the year during which the amended carryback CNOL is incurred.
(B)
Amended returns.
This paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B) applies if the date of the filing required under paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(A) of this section is not at least 150 days after the date of the statutory amendment to the carryback period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. Under this paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(B), an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement may be attached to an amended return filed by the date that is 150 days after the date of the statutory amendment referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.
(C)
Certain taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021.
This paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(C) applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, for which the date of the filing required under paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(A) of this section precedes November 30, 2020. Under this paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(C), an amended statute split-waiver election statement or extended split-waiver election statement may be attached to an amended return filed by November 30, 2020.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For purposes of these examples: All affiliated groups file consolidated returns; all corporations are includible corporations that have calendar taxable years; each of P, X, and T is a corporation having one class of stock outstanding; each of P and X is the common parent of a consolidated group (P Group and X Group, respectively); neither the P Group nor the X Group includes an insolvent financial institution or an insurance company; no NOL is a farming loss; there are no other relevant NOL carrybacks to the X Group's consolidated taxable years; except as otherwise stated, the X Group has sufficient consolidated taxable income determined under § 1.1502-11 (CTI) to absorb the stated NOL carryback by T; T has sufficient SRLY register income within the X Group to absorb the stated NOL carryback by T; all transactions occur between unrelated parties; and the facts set forth the only relevant transactions.
(i)
Example 1: Computation and absorption of amended carrybacks
—(A)
Facts.
In Year 1, T became a member of the X Group. On the last day of Year 5, P acquired all the stock of T from X. At the time of P's acquisition of T stock, the default carryback period was zero taxable years. The P Group did not make an irrevocable split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to relinquish, with respect to all CNOLs attributable to T while a member of the P Group, the portion of the carryback period for which T was a member of the X Group (that is, a former group). In Year 7, the P Group sustained a $1,000 CNOL, $600 of which was attributable to T pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. In that year, P did not make an irrevocable general waiver election under section 172(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the $1,000 CNOL when the P Group filed its consolidated return for Year 7. In Year 8, legislation was enacted that amended section 172 to require a carryback period of five years for NOLs arising in a taxable year beginning after Year 5 and before Year 9.
(B)
Analysis.
As a result of the amended carryback rules enacted in Year 8, the P Group's $1,000 CNOL in Year 7 must be carried back to Year 2. Therefore, T's $600 attributed portion of the P Group's Year 7 CNOL (that is, T's amended carryback CNOL) must be carried back to taxable years of the X Group.
See
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section. To the extent T's amended carryback CNOL is not absorbed in the X Group's Year 2 taxable year, the remaining portion must be carried to the X Group's Year 3, Year 4, and Year 5 taxable years, as appropriate.
See id.
Any remaining portion of T's amended carryback CNOL is carried to consolidated return years of the P Group.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Example 2: Amended statute split-waiver election
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, following the change in statutory carryback period in Year 8, the P Group made a valid amended statute split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to relinquish solely the carryback of T's amended carryback CNOL.
(B)
Analysis.
Because the P Group made a valid amended statute split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any taxable years of the X Group (that is, a former group). However, the amended statute split-waiver election does not prevent T's Year 7 amended carryback CNOL from being carried back to years of the P group (that is, the acquiring group) during which T was a member.
See
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(E) of this section. As a result, the entire amount of T's amended carryback CNOL is eligible to be carried back to taxable Year 6 of the P Group. Any remaining CNOL may then be carried over within the P Group.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Example 3: Computation and absorption of extended carrybacks
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the X Group had $300 of CTI in Year 4 and $200 of CTI in Year 5 and, at the time of the P Group's acquisition of T, the default carryback period was two years. Therefore, T's $600 attributed portion of the P Group's Year 7 CNOL was required to be carried back to the X Group's Year 5 taxable year, and the X Group was able to offset $200 of CTI in Year 5.
(B)
Analysis.
As a result of the amended carryback rules, the X Group must offset its $300 of CTI in Year 4 against T's amended carryback CNOL.
See
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) of this section. The remaining $100 ($600-$300-$200) of T's amended carryback CNOL is carried to taxable years of the P Group.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Example 4: Extended split-waiver election
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section (
Example 3
), except that, following the change in law in Year 8, the P Group made a valid extended split-waiver election under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to relinquish the extended carryback period for T's amended carryback CNOL for years in which T was a member of the X Group.
(B)
Analysis.
As a result of the P Group's extended split-waiver election, T's amended carryback CNOL is not eligible to be carried back to any portion of the extended carryback period (that is, any taxable year prior to Year 5).
See
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(I) of this section. As a result, the X Group absorbs $200 of T's $600 loss in Year 5, and the remaining $400 ($600-$200) is carried to taxable years of the P Group.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(7)
Short years in connection with transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
If a member distributes or transfers assets to a corporation that is a member immediately after the distribution or transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to have a short year within the consolidated return year of the group in which the transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for purposes of determining the years to which a net operating loss may be carried.
(c)
Limitations on net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks from separate return limitation years
—(1)
SRLY limitation
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of a member (SRLY member) arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs (SRLY NOLs) that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss (cumulative register). For this purpose—
(A) Consolidated taxable income is computed without regard to CNOL deductions;
(B) Consolidated taxable income takes into account the member's losses
and deductions (including capital losses) actually absorbed by the group in consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by the member);
(C) In computing consolidated taxable income, the consolidated return years of the group include only those years, including the year to which the loss is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude—
(
1
) For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the loss is carried; and
(
2
) For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the loss arose;
(D) The treatment under § 1.1502-15 of a built-in loss as a hypothetical net operating loss carryover in the year recognized is solely for purposes of determining the limitation under this paragraph (c) with respect to the loss in that year and not for any other purpose. Thus, for purposes of determining consolidated taxable income for any other losses, a built-in loss allowed under this section in the year it arises is taken into account; and
(E) If a limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset under section 172(a) (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) applies in a taxable year to a member whose carryovers or carrybacks are subject to a SRLY limitation (SRLY member), the amount of net operating loss subject to a SRLY limitation that is available for use by the group in that year is limited to the percentage of the balance in the cumulative register that would be available for offset under section 172(a) if the SRLY member filed a separate return and reported as taxable income in that year the amount contained in the cumulative register. For example, assume that a consolidated group has a SRLY member that is a corporation other than a nonlife insurance company, and that the SRLY member has a SRLY NOL that arose in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOL). The group's consolidated taxable income for a consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 2020 is $200, but the cumulative register has a positive balance of only $120 (and no other net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks are available for the year). Because the SRLY limitation would be $96 ($120 × 80 percent), only $96 of SRLY loss may be used, rather than $160 ($200 × 80 percent). In addition, to the extent that this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) applies, the cumulative register is decreased by the full amount of income required under section 172(a) to support the amount of SRLY NOL absorption. See, for example, paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section for examples illustrating the application of this rule.
(ii)
Losses treated as arising in SRLYs.
If a net operating loss carryover or carryback did not arise in a SRLY but is attributable to a built-in loss (as defined under § 1.1502-15), the carryover or carryback is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c) as arising in a SRLY if the built-in loss was not allowed, after application of the SRLY limitation, in the year it arose. For an illustration, see § 1.1502-15(d),
Example 5.
But see § 1.1502-15(g)(1).
(iii)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), no corporation is a nonlife insurance company and, unless otherwise specified, all taxable years begin after December 31, 2020, and all CNOLs arise in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. The principles of this paragraph (c)(1) are illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1: Determination of SRLY limitation.
(
1
) Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T, and T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. P acquires all the stock of T at the beginning of Year 2, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items.
(
2
) T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 arose in a SRLY. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, the $100 net operating loss carryover is subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 2 equals the consolidated taxable income of the P group determined by reference
to only T's items, or $70. However, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, the SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 × 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($300 × 80 percent = $240). Therefore, $56 of the SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 2. Although only $56 is absorbed, the cumulative register of T is reduced by $70, the full amount of income necessary to support the $56 deduction after taking into account the 80-percent limitation ($70 × 80 percent = $56).
(
3
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that such consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) for Year 2 is a loss (a CNOL) of $370. Because the SRLY limitation may not exceed the consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, and such items aggregate to a CNOL, T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is not allowed under the SRLY limitation in Year 2. Moreover, if consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) did not exceed $370 in Year 3, the carryover would still be restricted under paragraph (c) of this section in Year 3, because the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group computed by reference to only T's items would not be a positive amount.
(B)
Example 2: Net operating loss carryovers.
(
1
) In Year 1, Individual A forms P, and P sustains a $40 net operating loss that is carried forward. P has no income in Year 2. Individual A also owns T which sustains a net operating loss of $50 in Year 2 that is carried forward. P acquires the stock of T from Individual A during Year 3, but T is not a member of the P group for each day of the year. P and T file separate returns and sustain net operating losses of $120 and $60, respectively, for Year 3. The P group files consolidated returns beginning in Year 4. During Year 4, the P group has $160 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. These results are summarized as follows:
Separate
Year 1

Year 2

$0
$ (120)

T

CTI
160
(
2
) P's Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are not SRLYs with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(i). Thus, P's $40 net operating loss arising in Year 1 and $120 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are not subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Although the P group has $160 of taxable income in Year 4, the 80-percent limitation reduces the P group's net operating loss deduction in that year to $128 ($160 × 80 percent). Under the principles of section 172, paragraph (b) of this section requires that P's $40 loss arising in Year 1 be the first loss absorbed by the P group in Year 4. Absorption of this loss leaves $88 ($128−$40) of the P group's Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers.

) T's Year 2 and Year 3 are SRLYs with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's $50 net operating loss arising in Year 2 and $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $56 ($70 × 80 percent). Therefore, the P group can absorb up to $56 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4. Under the principles of section 172, T's $50 SRLY net operating loss from Year 2 is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 4. After absorption of this loss, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, $6 of
SRLY limit remains in Year 4 ($56−$50). Further, the total amount of Year 4 consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss carryovers under section 172(a) is $38 ($88−$50).
(
4
) P and T each carry over net operating losses to Year 4 from a taxable year ending on the same date (that is, Year 3). The losses carried over from Year 3 total $180. However, the remaining Year 4 SRLY limit is $6. Therefore, the total amount of loss available for absorption is $126 ($120 allocable to P and $6 allocable to T). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses available for absorption that are carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Thus, $36.19 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($120/($120 + $6)) × $38 = $36.19. In addition, $1.81 of T's Year 3 loss is absorbed ($6/($120 + $6)) × $38 = $1.81.
(
5
) After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. A total of $51.81 of SRLY net operating losses were absorbed in Year 4 ($50 + $1.81). After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $64.76 ($64.76 × 80 percent = $51.81). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $64.76, and $5.24 remains in the cumulative register ($70−$64.76).
(
6
) P carries its remaining $83.81 ($120−$36.19) Year 3 net operating loss and T carries its remaining $58.19 ($60−$1.81) Year 3 net operating loss over to Year 5. Assume that, in Year 5, the P group has $90 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). The P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items is a CNOL of $4. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of T in Year 5 equals $1.24 ($5.24−$4). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, T's SRLY limitation is $0.99 ($1.24 × 80 percent). For Year 5, the total amount of Year 5 consolidated taxable income available for offset by loss carryovers as a result of the 80-percent limitation is $72 ($90 × 80 percent). Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one loss arises in a SRLY and the other loss does not. Therefore, $71.16 of P's Year 3 loss is absorbed (($83.81/($83.81 + $0.99)) × $72 = $71.16). In addition, $0.84 of T's Year 3 losses is absorbed (($0.99/($83.81 + $0.99)) × $72 = $0.84).

(
3
) T's Year 4 is a SRLY with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(1). T's $30 net operating loss carryback to the P group from Year 4 is not allowed under paragraph (c) of this section to be included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section for Year 1, 2, or 3, because the P group's consolidated taxable income would not be a positive amount if determined by reference to only T's items for all consolidated return years through Year 4 (without regard to the $30 net operating loss). The $30 loss is carried forward to T's Year 5 and succeeding taxable years as provided under the Internal Revenue Code.

Example 4: Computation of SRLY limitation for built-in losses treated as net operating loss carryovers.
(

) Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300 and T sustains a $100 net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value by $100. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). At the time of the acquisition, T has a $100 net unrealized built-in loss, which exceeds the threshold requirements of
section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 3, T recognizes its unrealized loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income of the P group for Years 3 and 4 (computed without regard to T's recognition of its unrealized loss and any CNOL deduction under this section):

) Under § 1.1502-15(a), T's $100 of ordinary loss in Year 3 constitutes a built-in loss that is subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of the limitation is determined by treating the deduction as a net operating loss carryover from a SRLY. The built-in loss is therefore subject to both a SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation for Year 3. The built-in loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover solely for purposes of determining the extent to which the loss is not allowed by reason of the SRLY limitation, and for all other purposes the loss remains a loss arising in Year 3. See § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D). Consequently, under paragraph (b) of this section, the built-in loss is absorbed by the P group before the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is absorbed. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 3 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $60. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is $48 ($60 × 80 percent). Therefore, $48 of the built-in loss is absorbed by the P group. None of T's $100 SRLY net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is allowed.
(
3
) After deduction of T's $48 SRLY built-in loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($60−$60).
(
4
) Under § 1.1502-15(a), the $52 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation is treated as a $52 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is subject to the SRLY limitation because, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Year 3 is treated as a SRLY. The built-in loss is carried to other years in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T for Year 4 equals $40 (zero from Year 3 + $40). Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 4 is $32 ($40 × 80 percent). Therefore, under paragraph (c) of this section, $32 of T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 4.
(
5
) After deduction of T's $32 SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $40 ($40 × 80 percent = $32). Therefore, the cumulative register is decreased by $40, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($40−$40).
(E)
Example 5: Dual SRLY registers and accounting for SRLY losses actually absorbed.
(
1
) In Year 1, T sustains a $100 net operating loss and a $50 net capital loss. At the beginning of Year 2, T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). Both of T's carryovers from Year 1 are subject to SRLY limits under this paragraph (c) and § 1.1502-22(c). The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income for Years 2 and 3 (computed without regard to T's CNOL deduction under this section or net capital loss carryover under § 1.1502-22):
P
T
Year 1 (SRLY)

Capital

Capital

30
(
2
) For Year 2, the P group computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group determines its ability to use its capital loss carryover before it determines its ability to use its ordinary loss carryover. Under section 1212, because the P group has no Year 2 capital gain, it cannot absorb any capital losses in Year 2. T's Year 1 net capital loss and the P group's Year 2 consolidated net capital loss (all of which is attributable to T) are carried over to Year 3.
(
3
) The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 2 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the group's limitation for Year 2 is $72 ($90 × 80 percent). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 2 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $60. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 2 is $48 ($60 × 80 percent). Therefore, only $48 of T's Year 1 SRLY net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 2. T carries over its remaining $52 of its Year 1 loss to Year 3.
(
4
) After deduction of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2, the net operating loss cumulative register is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. The P group deducted $48 of T's SRLY net operating losses in Year 2. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of taxable income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the net operating loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the net operating loss cumulative register ($60−$60).
(
5
) For Year 3, the P group again computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group has consolidated net capital gain (without taking into account a net capital loss carryover deduction) of $30. Under § 1.1502-22(c), the aggregate amount of T's $50 capital loss carryover from Year 1 that is included in computing the P group's consolidated net capital gain for all years of the group (in this case, Years 2 and 3) may not exceed $30 (the aggregate consolidated net capital gain computed by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually absorbed (that is, $30 of capital gain in Year 3)). Thus, the P group may include $30 of T's Year 1 capital loss carryover in its computation of consolidated net capital gain for Year 3, which offsets the group's capital gains for Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 capital loss to Year 4. Therefore, the capital loss cumulative register of T is decreased by $30, and zero remains in the capital loss cumulative register ($30−$30). Further, because the net operating loss cumulative register includes all taxable income of T included in the P group, as well as all absorbed losses of T (including capital items), a zero net increase occurs in the net operating loss cumulative register. The P group carries over the Year 2 consolidated net capital loss to Year 4.
(
6
) The P group's ability to deduct net operating losses in Year 3 is subject to the 80-percent limitation, based on the P group's consolidated taxable income for the year. Thus, the P group's taxable income for Year 3 that can be offset, before use of net operating losses, is $40 (80 percent × the sum of zero capital gain, after use of the capital loss carryover, plus $50 of ordinary income). However, use of the Year 1 net operating loss also is subject to the SRLY limitation. The positive balance of the cumulative register of T applicable to SRLY net operating losses for Year 3 equals the P group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference only to T's items, or $40. This amount equals the sum obtained by adding the zero carryover from Year 2, a net inclusion of zero from capital items implicated in Year 3 ($30−$30), and $40 of taxable income in Year 3.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section, after taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the SRLY limitation for Year 3 is $32 ($40 × 80 percent). Therefore, only $32 of the Year 1 net operating loss is absorbed by the P group in Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 loss to Year 4.
(F)
Example 6: Pre-2018 NOLs and post-2017 NOLs.
(
1
) Individual A owns P. On January 1, 2017, A forms T. P and T are calendar-year taxpayers. In 2017, T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried over. During 2018, 2019, and 2020, T deducts a total of $90 of its 2017 net operating loss against its taxable income, and T carries over the remaining $10 of its 2017 net operating loss. In 2021, T sustains a net operating loss of $50. On December 31, 2021, P acquires all the stock of T, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in 2022 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. The P group has no other SRLY net operating loss carryovers or CNOL carryovers.
(
2
) T's remaining $10 of net operating loss carryover from 2017 and its $50 net operating loss carryover from 2021 are both SRLY losses in the P group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's net operating loss carryovers are subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The SRLY limitation for the P group's 2022 consolidated return year is consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's $70 of items.
(
3
) Because T's oldest (2017) carryover was sustained in a year beginning before January 1, 2018, its use is not subject to limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B). Therefore, all $10 of T's 2017 SRLY net operating loss (that is, a pre-2018 NOL) is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. After deduction of T's $10 SRLY net operating loss from 2017, the cumulative register of T is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $10, and $60 remains in the cumulative register ($70−$10).
(
4
) The P group's deduction of T's 2021 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY limitation and the 80-percent limitation under section 172(a)(2)(B)(ii). Therefore, the total limitation on the use of T's 2021 net operating loss in the P group is $48 (the remaining cumulative register of $60 × 80 percent). No losses from equivalent years are available, and the P group otherwise has sufficient consolidated taxable income to support the CNOL deduction ($290 × 80 percent = $232). Therefore, $48 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for 2022. The remaining $2 of T's 2021 SRLY net operating loss ($50−$48) is carried over to the P group's 2023 consolidated return year.
(
5
) After deduction of T's $48 SRLY NOL in 2022, the cumulative register of T is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $60 ($60 × 80 percent = $48). Therefore, the cumulative register of T is decreased by $60, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($60−$60).
(2)
SRLY subgroup limitation.
In the case of a net operating loss carryover or carryback for which there is a SRLY subgroup, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the contribution to consolidated taxable income and the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section are based on the aggregate amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the SRLY subgroup for the relevant consolidated return years (as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section). For an illustration of aggregate amounts during the relevant consolidated return years following the year in which a member of a SRLY subgroup ceases to be a member of the group, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii)
Example 4
of this
section. A SRLY subgroup may exist only for a carryover or carryback arising in a year that is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) with respect to another group (the former group), whether or not the group is a consolidated group, or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group). A separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each such carryover or carryback. A consolidated group may include more than one SRLY subgroup, and a member may be a member of more than one SRLY subgroup. Solely for purposes of determining the members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to a loss:
(i)
Carryovers.
In the case of a carryover, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying over the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was a member of the former group that becomes a member of the group at the same time as the loss member. A member remains a member of the SRLY subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the loss member. The aggregate determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and this paragraph (c)(2) includes the amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of each member of the SRLY subgroup for the consolidated return years during which it remains a member of the SRLY subgroup. For an illustration of the aggregate determination of a SRLY subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii)
Example 2
of this section.
(ii)
Carrybacks.
In the case of a carryback, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying back the loss (the loss member) and each other member of the group from which the loss is carried back that has been continuously affiliated with the loss member from the year to which the loss is carried through the year in which the loss arises.
(iii)
Built-in losses.
In the case of a built-in loss, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member recognizing the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was part of the subgroup with respect to the loss determined under § 1.1502-15(c)(2) immediately before the members became members of the group. The principles of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to determine the SRLY subgroup for the built-in loss that is, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, treated as arising in a SRLY with respect to the group in which the loss is recognized. For this purpose and as the context requires, a reference in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to a group or former group is a reference to the subgroup determined under § 1.1502-15(c)(2).
(iv)
Principal purpose of avoiding or increasing a SRLY limitation.
The members composing a SRLY subgroup are not treated as a SRLY subgroup if any of them is formed, acquired, or availed of with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any limitation under, this paragraph (c). Any member excluded from a SRLY subgroup, if excluded with a principal purpose of so avoiding or increasing any SRLY limitation, is treated as included in the SRLY subgroup.
(v)
Coordination with other limitations.
This paragraph (c)(2) does not allow a net operating loss to offset income to the extent inconsistent with other limitations or restrictions on the use of losses, such as a limitation based on the nature or activities of members. For example, a net operating loss may not offset income in excess of any limitations under section 172(a) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Additionally, any dual consolidated loss may not reduce the taxable income to an extent greater than that allowed under section 1503(d) and §§ 1.1503(d)-1 through 1.1503(d)-8. See also § 1.1502-47(k) (relating to preemption of rules for life-nonlife groups).
(vi)
Anti-duplication.
If the same item of income or deduction could be taken into account more than once in determining a limitation under this paragraph (c), or in a manner inconsistent with any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations incorporating this paragraph (c), the item of income or deduction is taken into account only once and in such manner that losses are absorbed in accordance with the ordering rules in paragraph (b) of this section and the underlying purposes of this section.
(vii)
Corporations that leave a SRLY subgroup.
If a loss member ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup, the amount of the member's remaining SRLY loss from a specific year is determined pursuant to the principles of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
(viii)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c)(2)(viii), no corporation is a nonlife insurance company or has any farming losses. The principles of this paragraph (c)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1: Members of SRLY subgroups.
(
1
) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, S, T and M. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, P sustains a $50 net operating loss. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S at a time when the aggregate basis of S's assets exceeds their aggregate value by $70, and S becomes a member of the P group. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T, T has a $60 net operating loss carryover at the time of the acquisition, and T becomes a member of the P group. During Year 4, S forms S1 and T forms T1, each by contributing assets with built-in gains which are, in the aggregate, material. S1 and T1 become members of the P group. During Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the members of the P group become members of the M group for the balance of Year 7. The $50 and $60 loss carryovers of P and T are carried to Year 7 of the M group, and the value and basis of S's assets did not change after it became a member of the former P group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).
(
2
) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each loss carryover and built-in loss. In the P group, P's $50 loss carryover is not treated as arising in a SRLY. See § 1.1502-1(f). Consequently, the carryover is not subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section in the P group.
(
3
) In the M group, P's $50 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of members which were members of the P group, the group as to which the loss was not a SRLY. The SRLY subgroup is composed of P, the member carrying over the loss, and each other member of the P group that became a member of the M group at the same time as P. A member of the SRLY subgroup remains a member until it ceases to be affiliated with P. For Year 7, the SRLY subgroup is composed of P, S, T, S1, and T1.
(
4
) In the P group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the P group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. See § 1.1502-15 and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Because S was not continuously affiliated with P, T, or T1 for 60 consecutive months prior to joining the P group, these corporations cannot be included in a SRLY subgroup with respect to S's unrealized loss in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. As a successor to S, S1 is included in a subgroup with S in the P group, and, because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.
(
5
) In the M group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the M group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. Prior to becoming a member of the M group, S had been continuously affiliated with P (but not T or T1) for 60 consecutive months, and S1 is a successor that has remained continuously affiliated with S. Those members had a net unrealized built-in loss immediately before they became members of
the group under § 1.1502-15(c). Consequently, in Year 7, S, S1, and P compose a subgroup in the M group with respect to S's unrealized loss. Because S1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the recognized built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.
(
6
) In the P group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. P, S, and S1 were not members of the group in which T's loss arose, and T's loss carryover was not subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the P group (the former group). Thus, P, S, and S1 are not members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the T carryover in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. As a successor to T, T1 is included in a SRLY subgroup with T in the P group, and, because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.

) In the M group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section, including the limitation under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. T and T1 remain the only members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the carryover. Because T1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.
(B)
Example 2: Computation of SRLY subgroup limitation.
(
1
) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M, none of which is a nonlife insurance company. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S and T from Individual A, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 3 (a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020), the P group has a $45 CNOL, which is attributable to P, and which P carries forward. M is the common parent of another group. At the beginning of Year 4, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).
(
2
) P's year to which the loss is attributable, Year 3, is a SRLY with respect to the M group. See § 1.1502-1(f)(1). However, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to the Year 3 loss under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section because Year 3 is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY) with respect to the P group. P's loss is carried over to the M group's Year 4 and is therefore subject to the SRLY subgroup limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(
3
) In Year 4, the M group has $10 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 4). That consolidated taxable income would be $45 if determined by reference only to the items of P, S, and T, the members included in the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's loss carryover. Therefore, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 4 equals $45 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $36 ($45 × 80 percent). However, the M group has only $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 4. Thus, due to the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of all net operating losses in Year 4 is limited to $8
($10 × 80 percent). As a result, the M group deducts $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss carryover, and the remaining $37 is carried over to Year 5.
(
4
) After deduction of $8 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 4, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $10 ($10 × 80 percent = $8). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $10, and $35 remains in the cumulative register ($45−$10).
(
5
) In Year 5, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 5). None of P, S, or T has any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss in Year 5. Although the members of the P SRLY subgroup do not contribute to the $100 of consolidated taxable income in Year 5, the positive balance of the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup for Year 5 is $35 and, due to the application of the 80-percent limitation under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the SRLY subgroup limitation under this paragraph (c)(2) is $28 ($35 × 80 percent). Because of the 80-percent limitation and the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the M group's deduction of net operating losses in Year 5 is limited to $80 ($100 × 80 percent). Because the $28 of net operating loss available to be absorbed is less than 80 percent of the M group's consolidated taxable income, $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss is absorbed in Year 5, and the remaining $9 ($37−$28) is carried over to Year 6.
(
6
) After deduction of $28 of P's SRLY net operating loss in Year 5, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section. After taking into account the 80-percent limitation, the amount of income necessary to support this deduction is $35 ($35 × 80 percent = $28). Therefore, the cumulative register of the P SRLY subgroup is decreased by $35, and zero remains in the cumulative register ($35−$35).
(C)
Example 3: Inclusion in more than one SRLY subgroup.
(
1
) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. S, P, and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, S acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the S group. For Year 1, the S group has a CNOL of $10, all of which is attributable to S and is carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 2, the P group has a CNOL of $35, all of which is attributable to P and is carried over to Year 3. At the beginning of Year 3, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).
(
2
) P's and S's net operating losses arising in SRLYs with respect to the M group are subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for P's $35 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 2 because, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, Year 2 is not a SRLY with respect to the P group. Similarly, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for S's $10 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 because Year 1 is not a SRLY with respect to the S group.
(
3
) S and T are members of both the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's losses and the SRLY subgroup with respect to S's losses. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S's and T's items cannot be included in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for both SRLY subgroups for the same consolidated return year; paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section requires the M group to consider the items of S and T only once so that the losses are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they were sustained. Because S's loss was incurred in Year 1, while P's loss was incurred in Year 2, the items will be added in the determination of the consolidated taxable income of the S and T SRLY subgroup to enable S's loss to be absorbed first. The taxable income of the P, S, and T SRLY subgroup is then computed by including the consolidated taxable income for the S and T SRLY subgroup
less the amount of any net operating loss carryover of S that is absorbed after applying this section to the S subgroup for the year.
(D)
Example 4: Corporation ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup.
(
1
) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and M. P and S are members of the P group and the P group has a CNOL of $30 in Year 1, all of which is attributable to P and carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, M acquires all of the stock of P, and P and S become members of the M group. P and S compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to P's net operating loss carryover. For Year 2, consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to only the items of P (and without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 2) is $40. However, such consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to the items of both P and S is a loss of $20. Thus, the SRLY subgroup limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section prevents the M group from including any of P's net operating loss carryover in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 2, and P carries the Year 1 loss to Year 3.
(
2
) At the end of Year 2, P sells all of the S stock, and S ceases to be a member of the M group and the P subgroup. For Year 3, consolidated taxable income of the M group is $50 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 3), and such consolidated taxable income would be $10 if determined by reference to only items of P. However, the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section for Year 3 for P's net operating loss carryover still prevents the M group from including any of P's loss in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section. The limitation results from the inclusion of S's items for Year 2 in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for Year 3 even though S ceased to be a member of the M group (and the P subgroup) at the end of Year 2. Thus, the M group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the SRLY subgroup members' items for all consolidated return years of the group through Year 3 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction) is not a positive amount.
(ix)
Application to other than loss carryovers.
Paragraph (g) of this section and the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)” in this paragraph (c)(2) apply only to carryovers of net operating losses, net capital losses, and for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, to carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2). Accordingly, as the context may require, if another regulation references this section and such other regulation does not concern a carryover of net operating losses, net capital losses, or for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2), then such reference does not include a reference to such paragraph or phrase.
(3)
Cross-reference.
For rules governing the application of a SRLY limitation to business interest expense for which a deduction is disallowed under section 163(j), see § 1.163(j)-5(d) and (f).
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Consolidated net operating loss.
Any excess of deductions over gross income, as determined under § 1.1502-11(a) (without regard to any consolidated net operating loss deduction), is also referred to as the consolidated net operating loss (or CNOL).
(f)
Predecessors and successors
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a corporation, member, common parent, or subsidiary, includes, as the context may require, a reference to a successor or predecessor, as defined in § 1.1502-1(f)(4).
(2)
Limitation on SRLY subgroups
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, if a successor's items of income and gain exceed the successor's items of deduction and loss (net positive income), then the net positive income attributable to the successor is excluded from the computation of the consolidated taxable income of a SRLY subgroup.
(ii)
Exceptions.
A successor's net positive income is not excluded from the
consolidated taxable income of a SRLY subgroup if—
(A) The successor acquires substantially all the assets and liabilities of its predecessor, and the predecessor ceases to exist;
(B) The successor was a member of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY subgroup members became members of the group;
(C) 100 percent of the stock of the successor is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the SRLY subgroup members became members of the group; or
(D) The Commissioner so determines.
(g)
Overlap with section 382
—(1)
General rule.
The limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to net operating loss carryovers (other than a hypothetical carryover described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section and a carryover described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) when the application of paragraph (c) of this section results in an overlap with the application of section 382. For a similar rule applying in the case of net operating loss carryovers described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, see § 1.1502-15(g).
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Generally.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382, the regulations thereunder, and §§ 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 apply.
(ii)
Overlap.
(A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and the application of section 382 with respect to a net operating loss carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 382 event).
(B) If an overlap described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section occurs with respect to net operating loss carryovers of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 382 event, then an overlap is treated as also occurring with respect to that corporation's net operating loss carryover that arises within the period beginning with the section 382 event and ending with the SRLY event.
(C) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup and/or a loss subgroup as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to a carryover, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(3)
Operating rules
—(i)
Section 382 event before SRLY event.
If a SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 382 event or within the six month period beginning on the date of the section 382 event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax year that includes the SRLY event.
(ii)
SRLY event before section 382 event.
If a section 382 event occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 382 event.
(4)
Subgroup rules.
In general, in the case of a net operating loss carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies—
(i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section only if—
(A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
(B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
(ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1: Overlap—Simultaneous Acquisition.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all
of the stock of S. P and S file a consolidated return. In Year 2, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net operating loss for that year. At the beginning of Year 3, S acquires T.
(B) S's acquisition of T results in T becoming a member of the P group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of T, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to the T carryover.
(C) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.
(D) Consequently, under this paragraph (g), in Year 3 the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $100 net operating loss.
(ii)
Example 2: Overlap—Section 382 event before SRLY event.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P, which in turn owns all of the stock of S. P and S file a consolidated return. In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T which incurs a $100 net operating loss for that year. On February 28 of Year 2, S purchases 55% of T from Individual B. On June 30, of Year 2, S purchases an additional 35% of T from Individual B.
(B) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover. The June 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
(C) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382.
(D) Consequently, under paragraph (g) of this section, in Year 2 the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 1 $100 net operating loss.
(iii)
Example 3: No overlap—Section 382 event before SRLY event.
(A) The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that Individual B does not sell the additional 35% of T to S until September 30, Year 2.
(B) The February 28 purchase of 55% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover. The September 30 purchase of 35% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event.
(C) Because the SRLY event did not occur within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is no overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation and a section 382 limitation.
(iv)
Example 4: Overlap—SRLY event before section 382 event.
(A) P and S file a consolidated return. S has owned 40% of T for 6 years. For Year 6, T has a net operating loss of $500 that is carried forward. On March 31, Year 7, S acquires an additional 40% of T, and on August 31, Year 7, S acquires the remaining 20% of T.
(B) The March 31 purchase of 40% of T results in T becoming a member of the P group and is therefore a SRLY event. The August 31 purchase of 20% of T is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of T, under section 382(g), that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation with respect to the T carryover.
(C) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of this paragraph (g).
(D) Under this paragraph (g), the SRLY rules of paragraph (c) of this section will apply to the Year 7 tax year. Beginning in Year 8 (the year after the section 382 event), any unabsorbed portion of the Year 6 net operating loss will not be subject to a SRLY limitation.
(v)
Example 5: Overlap—Coextensive subgroups.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of S, which in turn owns all of the stock of T. S and T file a consolidated return beginning in Year 1. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, the S group has a $200 consolidated
net operating loss which is carried forward, of which $100 is attributable to S, and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of Year 3, the P group acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A.
(B) P's acquisition of S results in S and T becoming members of the P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(C) S and T also compose a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover. P's acquisition also results in an ownership change of S, the subgroup parent, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to the Year 2 carryover.
(D) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section. Because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are coextensive, under paragraph (g) of this section, the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $200 net operating loss.
(vi)
Example 6: No overlap—Different subgroups.
(A) Individual B owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns all of the stock of S and all of the stock of T. Individual A owns all of the stock of X, the common parent of another consolidated group. In Year 1, the P group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss, of which $100 is attributable to S and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of Year 3, the X group acquires all of the stock of S and T from P and does not make an election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) (concerning an election to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as having been satisfied).
(B) X's acquisition of S and T results in S and T becoming members of the X group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(C) S and T do not bear (and are not treated as bearing) a section 1504(a)(1) relationship. Therefore S and T do not qualify as a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). X's acquisition of S and T results in separate ownership changes of S and T, that give rise to separate limitations under section 382(a) (the section 382 events) with respect to each of S and T's Year 1 net operating loss carryovers. See § 1.1502-94.
(D) The SRLY event and the change dates of the section 382 events occur on the same date. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply because the SRLY subgroup (composed of S and T) is not coextensive with a loss subgroup with respect to the Year 1 carryovers. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY subgroup limitation and also separate section 382 limitations for each of S and T.
(vii)
Example 7: No overlap—Different subgroups.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of T and all of the stock of S, the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of another consolidated group. In Year 1, T has a net operating loss of $100 that is carried forward. At the end of Year 2, S acquires all of the stock of T from Individual A. In Year 3, the S group sustains a $200 consolidated net operating loss that is carried forward. In Year 8, the P group acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A.
(B) S's acquisition of T in Year 1 results in T becoming a member of the S group. The acquisition, however, did not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). As a result, T's Year 1 net operating loss is subject to SRLY within the S group. At the end of Year 7, § 1.1502-96(a) treats T's Year 1 net operating loss as not having arisen in a SRLY with respect to the S group. Section 1.1502-96(a), however, applies only for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and § 1.1502-98 but not for purposes of this section. See § 1.1502-96(a)(5).
(C) P's acquisition of S in Year 8 results in S and T becoming members of the P group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss,
S and T do not compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(D) S and T compose a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. P's acquisition of S results in an ownership change of the loss subgroup, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a subgroup limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to that carryover.
(E) The SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date. However, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are not coextensive, T's Year 1 net operating loss carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation.
(F) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss carryover, S and T compose both a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). Thus, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, and the S group's Year 3 net operating loss carryover is not subject to a SRLY limitation.
(viii)
Example 8: SRLY after overlap.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of R and M, each the common parent of a consolidated group. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of D. In Year 1, D incurs a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. At the beginning of Year 3, R acquires all of the stock of D. In Year 5, M acquires all of the stock of R in a transaction that did not result in an ownership change of R.
(B) R's Year 3 acquisition of D results in D becoming a member of the R group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of D, that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to D's net operating loss carryover.
(C) Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and section 382 with respect to D's net operating loss. Consequently, under this paragraph (g), D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is not subject to a SRLY limitation in the R group.
(D) M's Year 5 acquisition of R results in R and D becoming members of the M group (the SRLY event), but does not result in an ownership change of R or D that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a). Because there is no section 382 event, the application of the SRLY rules and section 382 do not overlap. Consequently, D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group.
(E) Because D's Year 1 net operating loss carryover was subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section when it joined the R group, under § 1.1502-21(c)(2), the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover includes all of the members of the R group that joined the M group at the same time as D.
(ix)
Example 9: Overlap—Interim losses.
(A) Individual A owns all of the stock of P and S, each the common parent of a consolidated group. S owns all of the stock of T, its only subsidiary. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of M, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, the S group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss. On January 1 of Year 2, P acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A. On December 31 of Year 2, M acquires 51% of the stock of P from Individual A. On May 31 of Year 3, M acquires the remaining 49% of the stock of P from Individual A. The P group, for the Year 3 period prior to June 1, had a $50 consolidated net operating loss, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to S. Other than the losses described above, the P group does not have any other consolidated net operating losses.
(B) In the P group, S's $100 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of S and T, the members which were members of the S group as to which the loss was not a SRLY.
(C) M's December 31 purchase of 51% of P is a section 382 event because it results in an ownership change of the S loss subgroup that gives rise to a section 382(a) limitation (the section 382 event) with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover. The purchase,
however, does not result in an ownership change of P because it is not a loss corporation under section 382(k)(1). M's May 31 purchase of 49% of P results in P, S, and T becoming members of the M group and is therefore a SRLY event.
(D) With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a loss subgroup under § 1.1502-91(d)(1). The loss subgroup does not include P because the only loss at the time of the section 382 event was subject to SRLY with respect to the P group. See § 1.1502-91(d)(1).
(E) Because the SRLY event occurred within six months of the change date of the section 382 event and the SRLY subgroup and loss subgroup are coextensive with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section. Thus, the SRLY limitation does not apply to that carryover.
(F) The Year 3 net operating loss, which arose between the section 382 event and the SRLY event, is a net operating loss described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because it is the net operating loss of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 382 event.
(G) With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because P, a member of the SRLY subgroup for the Year 3 carryover, is not also a member of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the Year 1 net operating loss), the Year 3 carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group. See paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
(h)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
This section generally applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. However—
(i) In the event that paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to a particular net operating loss carryover in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this section to determine a limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the member's or subgroup's items of income, gain, deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return was on or before June 25, 1999, paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be applied without regard to the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)”; and
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies shall constitute a section 382 event.
(iii) Paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(iv)(B)(

§ 1.1502-22
Consolidated capital gain and loss.
(a)
Capital gain.
The determinations under section 1222, including capital gain net income, net long-term capital gain, and net capital gain, with respect to members during consolidated return years are not made separately. Instead, consolidated amounts are determined for the group as a whole. The consolidated capital gain net income for any consolidated return year is determined by reference to—
(1) The aggregate gains and losses of members from sales or exchanges of capital assets for the year (other than gains and losses to which section 1231 applies);
(2) The consolidated net section 1231 gain for the year (determined under § 1.1502-23); and
(3) The net capital loss carryovers or carrybacks to the year.
(b)
Net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks
—(1)
In general.
The determinations under section 1222, including net capital loss and net short-term capital loss, with respect to members during consolidated return years are not made separately. Instead, consolidated amounts are determined for the group as a whole. Losses included in the consolidated net capital loss may be carried to consolidated return years, and, after apportionment, may be carried to separate return years. The net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks consist of—
(i) Any consolidated net capital losses of the group; and
(ii) Any net capital losses of the members arising in separate return years.
(2)
Carryovers and carrybacks generally.
The net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the principles of section 1212 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to be absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they were sustained, and losses carried from taxable years ending on the same date, and which are available to offset consolidated capital gain net income, generally are absorbed on a pro rata basis. Additional rules provided under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply, as well as the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. See, e.g., section 382(l)(2)(B).
(3)
Carryovers and carrybacks of consolidated net capital losses to separate return years.
If any consolidated net capital loss that is attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2), the amount of the consolidated net capital loss that is attributable to the member is apportioned and carried to the separate return year (apportioned loss).
(4)
Special rules
—(i)
Short years in connection with transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
If a member distributes or transfers assets to a corporation
that is a member immediately after the distribution or transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to have a short year within the consolidated return year of the group in which the transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for purposes of determining the years to which a net capital loss may be carried.
(ii)
Special status losses.
[Reserved]
(c)
Limitations on net capital loss carryovers and carrybacks from separate return limitation years.
The aggregate of the net capital losses of a member arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the determination of consolidated capital gain net income for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate of the consolidated capital gain net income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of gain and loss from capital assets as defined in section 1221 and trade or business assets defined in section 1231(b), including the member's losses actually absorbed by the group in the taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member). The principles of § 1.1502-21(c) (including the SRLY subgroup principles under § 1.1502-21(c)(2)) apply with appropriate adjustments for purposes of applying this paragraph (c).
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Consolidated net capital loss.
Any excess of losses over gains, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section (without regard to any carryovers or carrybacks), is also referred to as the consolidated net capital loss.
(f)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, the principles of § 1.1502-21(f) apply with appropriate adjustments.
(g)
Overlap with section 383
—(1)
General rule.
The limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to net capital loss carryovers ((other than a hypothetical carryover like those described in § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D) and a carryover like those described in § 1.1502-21(c)(1)(ii)) when the application of paragraph (c) of this section results in an overlap with the application of section 383. For a similar rule applying in the case of net capital loss carryovers like those described in §§ 1.1502-21(c)(1)(i)(D) and (c)(1)(ii), see § 1.1502-15(g).
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Generally.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the definitions and nomenclature contained in sections 382 and 383, the regulations thereunder, and §§ 1.1502-90 through 1.1502-99 apply.
(ii)
Overlap.
(A) An overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and the application of section 383 with respect to a net capital loss carryover occurs if a corporation becomes a member of the consolidated group (the SRLY event) within six months of the change date of an ownership change giving rise to a section 382 limitation with respect to that carryover (the section 383 event).
(B) If an overlap described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section occurs with respect to net capital loss carryovers of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 383 event, then an overlap is treated as also occurring with respect to that corporation's net capital loss carryover that arises within the period beginning with the section 383 event and ending with the SRLY event.
(C) For special rules in the event that there is a SRLY subgroup and/or a loss subgroup as defined in § 1.1502-91(d)(1) with respect to a carryover, see paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(3)
Operating rules
—(i)
Section 383 event before SRLY event.
If a SRLY event occurs on the same date as a section 383 event or within the six month period beginning on the date of the section 383 event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies beginning with the tax year that includes the SRLY event.
(ii)
SRLY event before section 383 event.
If a section 383 event occurs within the period beginning the day after the SRLY event and ending six months after the SRLY event, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies starting with the first tax year that begins after the section 383 event.
(4)
Subgroup rules.
In general, in the case of a net capital loss carryover for which there is a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-
91(d)(1)), the principles of this paragraph (g) apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies—
(i) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section only if—
(A) All members of the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover are also included in a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
(B) All members of a loss subgroup with respect to that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover; and
(ii) With respect to a carryover described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section only if all members of the SRLY subgroup for that carryover are also members of a SRLY subgroup that has net capital loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(h)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section generally applies to taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999. However—
(i) In the event that paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to a particular net capital loss carryover in the current group, then solely for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this section to determine a limitation with respect to that carryover and with respect to which the SRLY register (consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the member's or subgroup's items of income, gain, deduction, or loss) began in a taxable year for which the due date of the return was on or before June 25, 1999, the principles of § 1.1502-21(c)(2) shall be applied without regard to the phrase “or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or § 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)”; and
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, only an ownership change to which section 383, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies and which results in a section 382 limitation shall constitute a section 383 event.
(2)
Prior periods.
For certain taxable years ending on or before June 25, 1999, see § 1.1502-22T in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable.
[T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36114, July 2, 1999, as amended by T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106868, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-23
Consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss.
(a)
In general.
Net section 1231 gains and losses of members arising during consolidated return years are not determined separately. Instead, the consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss is determined under this section for the group as a whole.
(b)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this section:

# Example. Use of SRLY registers with net gains and net losses under section 1231.
(i) In Year 1, T sustains a $20 net capital loss. At the beginning of Year 2, T becomes a member of the P group. T's capital loss carryover from Year 1 is subject to SRLY limits under § 1.1502-22(c). The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income for Year 2 (computed without regard to T's net capital loss carryover under § 1.1502-22):
P
T
Year 1 (SRLY)
Ordinary
Capital
(20)
Year 2
Ordinary
10
20
Capital
70
0
§ 1231
(60)
30
(ii) Under section 1231, if the section 1231 losses for any taxable year exceed the section 1231 gains for such taxable year, such gains and losses are treated as ordinary gains or losses. Because the P group's section 1231 losses, $(60), exceed the section 1231 gains, $30, the P group's net loss is treated as an ordinary loss. T's net section 1231 gain has the same character as the P group's consolidated net section 1231 loss, so T's $30 of section 1231 income is treated as ordinary income for purposes of applying § 1.1502-22(c). Under § 1.1502-22(c), the group's consolidated net capital gain determined by reference only to T's items is $0. None of T's capital loss carryover from Year 1 may be taken into account in Year 2.
(c)
Recapture of ordinary loss.
[Reserved]
(d)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to gains and losses arising in the determination of consolidated net section 1231 gain or loss for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after June 25, 1999.
(2)
Application to prior periods.
See § 1.1502-21(h)(3) for rules applicable to groups that applied the rules of this section to consolidated return years ending on or after January 29, 1991, and beginning before January 1, 1997.
[T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36115, July 2, 1999; 64 FR 41784, Aug. 2, 1999]
§ 1.1502-24
Consolidated charitable contributions deduction.
(a)
Determination of amount of consolidated charitable contributions deduction.
The deduction allowed by section 170 for the taxable year shall be the lesser of:
(1) The aggregate deductions of the members of the group allowable under section 170 (determined without regard to section 170(b)(2)), plus the consolidated charitable contribution carryovers to such year, or
(2) The percentage limitation on the total charitable contribution deduction provided in section 170(b)(2)(A) applied to adjusted consolidated income as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Carryover of excess charitable contributions.
The consolidated charitable contribution carryovers to any consolidated return year shall consist of any excess consolidated charitable contributions of the group, plus any excess charitable contributions of members of the group arising in separate return years of such members, which may be carried over to the taxable year under the principles of section 170(b) (2) and (3). However, such consolidated carryovers shall not include any excess charitable contributions apportioned to a corporation for a separate return year pursuant to paragraph (e) of § 1.1502-79.
(c)
Adjusted consolidated taxable income.
For purposes of this section, the adjusted consolidated taxable income of the group for any consolidated return year is the consolidated taxable income computed without regard to this section, section 243(a)(2) and (3), and § 1.1502-26, and without regard to any consolidated net operating or net capital loss carrybacks to such year.
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966; as amended by T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106868, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-26
Consolidated dividends received deduction.
(a)
In general.
The consolidated dividends received deduction for the taxable year is the lesser of—
(1) The aggregate of the deduction of the members of the group allowable under sections 243(a)(1), 245(a) and (b), and 250 (computed without regard to the limitations provided in section 246(b)), or
(2) The aggregate amount described in section 246(b), determined by substituting, wherever it appears—
(i) The term
consolidated taxable income
for
taxable income,
(ii) The term
consolidated net operating loss
for
net operating loss,
and
(iii) The term
consolidated net capital loss
for
capital loss.
(b)
Intercompany dividends.
The deduction determined under paragraph (a) of this section is determined without taking into account intercompany dividends to the extent that, under § 1.1502-13(f)(2), they are not included in gross income. See § 1.1502-13 for additional rules relating to intercompany dividends.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
(1)
Example 1.
(i) Corporations P, S, and S-1 filed a consolidated return for the calendar year 2023 showing consolidated taxable income of $100,000 (determined without regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction, and the consolidated dividends received deduction). These corporations received dividends during such year from less than 20-percent owned domestic corporations as follows:
Table 1 to Paragraph
(c)(1)(i)
Corporation
Dividends
P
$6,000
S
10,000
S-1
34,000
Total
50,000
(ii) The dividends received deduction allowable to each member under section 243(a)(1) (computed without regard to the limitation in section 246(b)) is as follows: P has $3,000 (50 percent of $6,000), S has $5,000 (50 percent of $10,000), and S-1 has $17,000 (50 percent of $34,000), or a total of $25,000. Since $25,000 is less than $50,000 (50 percent of $100,000), the consolidated dividends received deduction is $25,000.
(2)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the consolidated net operating loss deduction and the consolidated dividends received deduction) was $40,000. The aggregate of the dividends received deductions, $42,500, computed without regard to section 246(b), results in a consolidated net operating loss of $2,500.
See
section 172(d)(5). Therefore, paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply and the consolidated dividends received deduction is $42,500.
[T.D. 6894, 31 FR 11794, Sept. 8, 1966, as amended by T.D. 7631, 44 FR 40497, July 11, 1979; T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36710, July 18, 1995; T.D. 8677, 61 FR 33323, June 27, 1996; T.D. 8823, 64 FR 36099, July 2, 1999; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106868, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1502-28
Consolidated section 108.
(a)
In general.
This section sets forth rules for the application of section 108(a) and the reduction of tax attributes pursuant to section 108(b) when a member of the group realizes discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) (excluded COD income).
(1)
Application of section 108(a).
Section 108(a)(1)(A) and (B) is applied separately to each member that realizes excluded COD income. Therefore, the limitation of section 108(a)(3) on the amount of discharge of indebtedness income that is treated as excluded COD income is determined based on the assets (including stock and securities of other members) and liabilities (including liabilities to other members) of only the member that realizes excluded COD income.
(2)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to the debtor
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a member that realizes excluded COD income in a taxable year, the tax attributes attributable to that member (and its direct and indirect subsidiaries to the extent required by section 1017(b)(3)(D) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section), including basis of assets and losses and credits arising in separate return limitation years, shall be reduced as provided in sections 108 and 1017 and this section. Basis of subsidiary stock, however, shall not be reduced below zero pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section (including when subsidiary stock is treated as depreciable property under section 1017(b)(3)(D) when there is an election under section 108(b)(5)).
(ii)
Consolidated tax attributes attributable to a member.
For purposes of this section, the amount of a consolidated tax attribute (e.g., a consolidated net operating loss) that is attributable to a member shall be determined pursuant to the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). In addition, if the member is a member of a separate return limitation year subgroup, the amount of a tax attribute that arose in a separate return limitation year that is attributable to that member shall also be determined pursuant to the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv).
(3)
Look-through rules
—(i)
Priority of section 1017(b)(3)(D).
If a member treats stock of a subsidiary as depreciable property pursuant to section 1017(b)(3)(D), the basis of the depreciable property of such subsidiary shall be reduced pursuant to section 1017(b)(3)(D) prior to the application of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Application of additional look-through rule.
If the basis of stock of a corporation (the lower-tier member) that is owned by another corporation (the higher-tier member) is reduced pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and paragraph (a)(2) of this section (but not as a result of treating subsidiary stock as depreciable property pursuant to section 1017(b)(3)(D)), and both of such corporations are members of the same consolidated group on the last day of the higher-tier member's taxable year that includes the date on which the excluded COD income is realized or the first day of the higher-tier member's taxable year that follows the taxable year that includes the date on which
the excluded COD income is realized, solely for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section other than paragraphs (a)(4) and (b)(1) of this section, the lower-tier member shall be treated as realizing excluded COD income on the last day of the taxable year of the higher-tier member that includes the date on which the higher-tier member realized the excluded COD income. The amount of such excluded COD income shall be the amount of such basis reduction. Accordingly, the tax attributes attributable to such lower-tier member shall be reduced as provided in sections 108 and 1017 and this section. To the extent that the excluded COD income realized by the lower-tier member pursuant to this paragraph (a)(3) does not reduce a tax attribute attributable to the lower-tier member, such excluded COD income shall not be applied to reduce tax attributes attributable to any member under paragraph (a)(4) of this section and shall not cause an excess loss account to be taken into account under § 1.1502-19(b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii)(B).
(4)
Reduction of certain tax attributes attributable to other members.
To the extent that, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the excluded COD income is not applied to reduce the tax attributes attributable to the member that realizes the excluded COD income, after the application of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, such amount shall be applied to reduce the remaining consolidated tax attributes of the group, other than consolidated tax attributes to which a SRLY limitation applies, as provided in section 108 and this section. Such amount also shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes attributable to members that arose (or are treated as arising) in a separate return limitation year to the extent that the member that realizes excluded COD income is a member of the separate return limitation year subgroup with respect to such attribute if a SRLY limitation applies to the use of such attribute. In addition, such amount shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes attributable to members that arose in a separate return year or that arose (or are treated as arising) in a separate return limitation year if no SRLY limitation applies to the use of such attribute. The reduction of each tax attribute pursuant to the three preceding sentences shall be made in the order prescribed in section 108(b)(2) and pursuant to the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(1). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(4), a tax attribute that arose in a separate return year or that arose (or is treated as arising) in a separate return limitation year is not subject to reduction pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4). Basis in assets is not subject to reduction pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4). Finally, to the extent that the realization of excluded COD income by a member pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) does not reduce a tax attribute attributable to such lower-tier member, such excess shall not be applied to reduce tax attributes attributable to any member pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4).
(b)
Special rules
—(1)
Multiple debtor members
—(i)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor members prior to reduction of consolidated tax attributes.
If in a single taxable year multiple members realize excluded COD income, paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply with respect to the excluded COD income of each such member before the application of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Reduction of higher-tier debtor's tax attributes.
If in a single taxable year multiple members realize excluded COD income and one such member is a higher-tier member of another such member, paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall be applied with respect to the excluded COD income of the higher-tier member before such paragraphs are applied to the excluded COD income of the other such member. In applying the rules of paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to the excluded COD income of the higher-tier member, the liabilities that give rise to the excluded COD income of the other such member shall not be treated as discharged for purposes of computing the limitation on basis reduction under section 1017(b)(2). A member (the first member) is a higher-tier member of another member (the second member) if the first member is the common parent or investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the second member
would affect investment adjustments with respect to the stock of the first member.
(iii)
Reduction of additional tax attributes.
If more than one member realizes excluded COD income that has not been applied to reduce a tax attribute attributable to such member (the remaining COD amount) and the remaining tax attributes available for reduction under paragraph (a)(4) of this section are less than the aggregate of the remaining COD amounts, after the application of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each such member's remaining COD amount shall be applied on a pro rata basis (based on the relative remaining COD amounts), pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, to reduce such remaining available tax attributes.
(iv)
Ownership of lower-tier member by multiple higher-tier members.
If stock of a corporation is held by more than one higher-tier member of the group and more than one such higher-tier member reduces its basis in such stock, then under paragraph (a)(3) of this section the excluded COD income resulting from the stock basis reductions shall be applied on a pro rata basis (based on the amount of excluded COD income caused by each basis reduction) to reduce the attributes of the corporation.
(v)
Ownership of lower-tier member by multiple higher-tier members in multiple groups.
If a corporation is a member of one group (the first group) on the last day of the first group's higher-tier member's taxable year that includes the date on which that higher-tier member realizes excluded COD income and is a member of another group (the second group) on the following day and the first group's higher-tier member and the second group's higher-tier member both reduce their basis in the stock of such corporation pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section, paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall first be applied in respect of the excluded COD income that results from the reduction of the basis of the corporation's stock owned by the first group's higher-tier member and then shall be applied in respect of the excluded COD income that results from the reduction of the basis of the corporation's stock owned by the second group's higher-tier member.
(2)
Election under section 108(b)(5)
—(i)
Availability of election.
The group may make the election described in section 108(b)(5) for any member that realizes excluded COD income. The election is made separately for each member. Therefore, an election may be made for one member that realizes excluded COD income (either actually or pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) while another election, or no election, may be made for another member that realizes excluded COD income (either actually or pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section). See § 1.108-4 for rules relating to the procedure for making an election under section 108(b)(5).
(ii)
Treatment of shares with an excess loss account.
For purposes of applying section 108(b)(5)(B), the basis of stock of a subsidiary that has an excess loss account shall be treated as zero.
(3)
Application of section 1017
—(i)
Timing of basis reduction.
Basis of property shall be subject to reduction pursuant to the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and this section after the determination of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year during which the member realizes excluded COD income and any prior years and coincident with the reduction of other attributes pursuant to section 108 and this section. However, only the basis of property held as of the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year during which the excluded COD income is realized is subject to reduction pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section.
(ii)
Limitation of section 1017(b)(2).
The limitation of section 1017(b)(2) on the reduction in basis of property shall be applied by reference to the aggregate of the basis of the property held by the member that realizes excluded COD income, not the aggregate of the basis of the property held by all of the members of the group, and the liabilities of such member, not the aggregate liabilities of all of the members of the group.
(iii)
Treatment of shares with an excess loss account.
For purposes of applying section 1017(b)(2) and § 1.1017-1, the basis of stock of a subsidiary that has
an excess loss account shall be treated as zero.
(4)
Application of section 1245.
Notwithstanding section 1017(d)(1)(B), a reduction of the basis of subsidiary stock is treated as a deduction allowed for depreciation only to the extent that the amount by which the basis of the subsidiary stock is reduced exceeds the total amount of the attributes attributable to such subsidiary that are reduced pursuant to the subsidiary's consent under section 1017(b)(3)(D) or as a result of the application of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Reduction of basis of intercompany obligations and former intercompany obligations
—(i)
Intercompany obligations that cease to be intercompany obligations.
If excluded COD income is realized in a consolidated return year in which an intercompany obligation becomes an obligation that is not an intercompany obligation because the debtor or creditor becomes a nonmember, or because the assets of the debtor or the creditor are acquired by a nonmember in a transaction to which section 381 applies, then the basis of such intercompany obligation (or new obligation if the intercompany obligation is deemed reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)) is available for reduction in respect of such excluded COD income pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section.
(ii)
Intercompany obligations.
The reduction of the basis of an intercompany obligation pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section shall not result in the satisfaction and reissuance of the obligation under § 1.1502-13(g). Therefore, any income or gain (or reduction of loss or deduction) attributable to a reduction of the basis of an intercompany obligation will be taken into account when § 1.1502-13(g)(3) applies to such obligation. Furthermore, § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(i) (regarding the treatment of intercompany items if corresponding items are excluded or nondeductible) will not apply to exclude any amount of income or gain attributable to a reduction of the basis of an intercompany obligation pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section. See § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(i)(A)(
1
) and (g)(4)(i)(A).
(6)
Taking into account excess loss account
—(i)
Determination of inclusion.
The determination of whether any portion of an excess loss account in a share of stock of a subsidiary that realizes excluded COD income is required to be taken into account as a result of the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B) is made after the determination of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for the year during which the member realizes excluded COD income (without regard to whether any portion of an excess loss account in a share of stock of the subsidiary is required to be taken into account) and any prior years, after the reduction of tax attributes pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and this section, and after the adjustment of the basis of the share of stock of the subsidiary pursuant to § 1.1502-32 to reflect the amount of the subsidiary's deductions and losses that are absorbed in the computation of taxable income (or loss) for the year of the disposition and any prior years, and the excluded COD income applied to reduce attributes and the attributes reduced in respect thereof. See § 1.1502-11(c) for special rules related to the computation of tax that apply when an excess loss account is required to be taken into account.
(ii)
Timing of inclusion.
To the extent an excess loss account in a share of stock of a subsidiary that realizes excluded COD income is required to be taken into account as a result of the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B), such amount shall be included on the group's tax return for the taxable year that includes the date on which the subsidiary realizes such excluded COD income.
(7)
Dispositions of stock.
See § 1.1502-11(c) for limitations on the reduction of tax attributes when a member disposes of stock of another member (including dispositions that result from the application of § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(iii)(B)) during a taxable year in which any member realizes excluded COD income.
(8)
Departure of member.
If the taxable year of a member (the departing member) during which such member realizes excluded COD income ends on or prior to the last day of the consolidated return year and, on the first day of the taxable year of such member that follows the taxable year during which
such member realizes excluded COD income, such member is not a member of the group and does not have a successor member (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section), all tax attributes listed in section 108(b)(2) that remain after the determination of the tax imposed that belong to members of the group (including the departing member and subsidiaries of the departing member) shall be subject to reduction as provided in section 108 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (including § 1.108-7(c), if applicable) and this section.
(9)
Intragroup reorganization
—(i)
In general.
If the taxable year of a member during which such member realizes excluded COD income ends prior to the last day of the consolidated return year and, on the first day that follows the taxable year of such member during which such member realizes excluded COD income, such member has a successor member, for purposes of applying the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, notwithstanding § 1.108-7, the successor member shall be treated as the member that realized the excluded COD income. Thus, all attributes attributable to the successor member listed in section 108(b)(2) (including attributes that were attributable to the successor member prior to the date such member became a successor member) are available for reduction under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Group structure change.
If a member that realizes excluded COD income acquires the assets of the common parent of the consolidated group in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and succeeds such common parent under the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) as the common parent of the consolidated group, the member's attributes that remain after the determination of tax for the group for the consolidated return year during which the excluded COD income is realized (and any prior years) (including attributes that were attributable to the former common parent prior to the date of the transaction to which section 381(a) applies) shall be available for reduction under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(10)
Definition of successor member.
A successor member means a person to which the member that realizes excluded COD income (or a successor member) transfers its assets in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies if such transferee is a member of the group immediately after the transaction.
(11)
Non-application of next day rule.
For purposes of applying the rules of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, the next day rule of § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) shall not apply to treat a member's excluded COD income as realized at the beginning of the day following the day on which such member's status as a member changes.
(c)
Examples.
The principles of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise indicated, no election under section 108(b)(5) has been made and the taxable year of all consolidated groups is the calendar year. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiary S1. P owns 80 percent of the stock of S1. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $250 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $125 was attributable to P and $125 was attributable to S1. On Day 1 of Year 2, P acquired 100 percent of the stock of S2, and S2 joined the P group. As of the beginning of Year 2, S2 had a $50 net operating loss carryover from Year 1, a separate return limitation year. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $200 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $90 was attributable to P, $70 was attributable to S1, and $40 was attributable to S2. In Year 3, S2 realized $200 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. In that same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $40 was attributable to S1 and $10 was attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of Year 4, S2 had Asset A with a fair market value of $10. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 3 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, Asset A had a basis of $40 and S2 had no liabilities.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S2 must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $200.
(
1
)
Reduction of net operating losses.
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and
the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to S2, to $40. Then, again pursuant to section 108(b)(4)(B), S2's net operating loss carryover of $50 from its separate return limitation year is reduced to $0. Finally, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $40, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $160.
(
2
)
Reduction of basis.
Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2, S2 reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S2 reduces its basis in Asset A by $40, from $40 to $0.
(B)
Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes.
The remaining $60 of excluded COD income then reduces consolidated tax attributes pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. In particular, the remaining $40 consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20 from $250 to $230. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a pro rata amount of the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 that is attributable to each of P and S1 is treated as reduced. Therefore, $10 of the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 that is attributable to each of P and S1 is treated as reduced.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group that includes subsidiaries S1 and S2. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S1 and S1 owns 100 percent of the stock of S2. None of P, S1, or S2 has a separate return limitation year. In Year 1, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $10 was attributable to P, $20 was attributable to S1, and $20 was attributable to S2. In Year 2, the P group sustained a $70 consolidated net operating loss. Under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv), of that amount, $30 was attributable to P, $30 was attributable to S1, and $10 was attributable to S2. In Year 3, S1 realized $170 of excluded COD income from the discharge of non-intercompany indebtedness. In that same year, the P group sustained a $50 consolidated net operating loss, of which $10 was attributable to S1 and $40 was attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv). As of the beginning of Year 4, S1's sole asset was the stock of S2, and S2 had Asset A with a $10 value. After the computation of tax imposed for Year 3 and before the application of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S1 had an $80 basis in the S2 stock, Asset A had a basis of $0, and neither S1 nor S2 had any liabilities.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Reduction of tax attributes attributable to debtor.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the tax attributes attributable to S1 must first be reduced to take into account its excluded COD income in the amount of $170.
(

)
Reduction of net operating losses.
Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by $10, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 attributable to S1, to $40. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to $30, and the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $30, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S1, to $40.
(
2
)
Reduction of basis.
Following the reduction of the net operating loss and the net operating loss carryovers attributable to S1, S1 reduces its basis in its assets pursuant to section 1017 and § 1.1017-1. Accordingly, S1 reduces its basis in the stock of S2 by $80, from $80 to $0.
(

)
Tiering down of stock basis reduction.
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for purposes of sections 108 and 1017 and this section, S2 is treated as realizing $80 of excluded COD income. Pursuant to section 108(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section, therefore, the net operating loss and net operating loss carryovers attributable to S2 under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) are reduced in the order prescribed by section 108(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 is reduced by an additional $40, the portion of the consolidated net operating loss for Year 3 attributable to S2, to $0. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $20, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $10. Then, the consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 2 is reduced by $10, the portion of that consolidated net operating loss carryover attributable to S2, to $30. S2's remaining $10 of excluded COD income does not reduce consolidated tax attributes attributable to P or S1 under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(B)
Reduction of remaining consolidated tax attributes.
Finally, pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, S1's remaining $30 of excluded COD income reduces the remaining consolidated tax attributes. In particular, the remaining $10 consolidated net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is reduced by $10
