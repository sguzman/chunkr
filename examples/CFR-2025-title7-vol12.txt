# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart B—Uniform System of Accounts
§ 1767.10
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Accounting borrower
is an RUS borrower.
Accounts
are the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts.
Actually issued
as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, are those which have been sold to bona fide purchasers for a valuable consideration, those issued as dividends on stock, and those which have been issued in accordance with contractual requirements direct to trustees of sinking funds.
Actually outstanding
as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, are those which have been actually issued and are neither retired nor held by or for the utility; provided, however, that securities held by trustees shall be considered as actually outstanding.
Amortization
is the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an account by distributing such amount over a fixed period, over the life of the asset or liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is anticipated the benefit will be realized.
Associated (affiliated) companies
are companies or persons that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control, or are controlled by, or under common control with, the accounting company.
Book Cost
means the amount at which property is recorded in these accounts without deduction of related provisions for accrued depreciation, amortization, or for other purposes.
CFC
is the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation.
Continuing property records
are company plant records for retirement units and mass property that provide, as either a single record, or in separate records readily obtainable by references made in a single record, the following information:
(1) For each retirement unit:
(i) The name or description of the unit, or both;
(ii) The location of the unit;
(iii) The date the unit was placed in service;
(iv) The cost of the unit as set forth in § 1767.16 (b) and (c); and
(v) The plant control account to which the cost of the unit is charged.
(2) For each category of mass property:
(i) A general description of the property and quantity;
(ii) The quantity placed in service by vintage year;
(iii) The average cost as set forth in § 1767.16 (b) and (c); and
(iv) The plant control account to which the costs are charged.
Control
(including the terms
controlling, controlled by,
and
under common control with
) is the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority or minority ownership or through voting of securities; common directors, officers, or stockholders; voting trusts; holding trusts; associated companies; contracts; or any other direct or indirect means.
Cost
is the amount of money actually paid for property or services. When the consideration given is other than cash in a purchase and sale transaction, as distinguished from a transaction involving the issuance of common stock in a merger or a pooling of interest, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis.
Cost of removal
is the cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing down or otherwise removing electric plant, including the cost of transportation and handling incidental thereto. It does not include the cost of removal activities associated with asset retirement obligations that are capitalized as part of the tangible long-lived assets that give rise to the obligation. (See § 1767.15(y).
Customer

Debt expense
includes all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and initial sale of evidence of debt, such as fees for drafting mortgages and trust deeds; fees and taxes for issuing or recording evidences of debt; costs of engraving and printing bonds and certificates of indebtedness; fees paid to trustees; specific costs of obtaining governmental authority; fees for legal services; fees and commissions paid underwriters, brokers, and salesmen for marketing such evidences of debt; fees and expenses of listing on exchanges; and other like costs.
Depreciation,
as applied to depreciable electric plant, is the loss in service value, not restored by current maintenance, incurred in connection with the consumption or prospective retirement of electric plant in the course of service from causes which are known to be in current operation and against which the utility is not protected by insurance. Among the causes to be given consideration are wear and tear, decay, action of the elements, inadequacy, obsolescence, changes in the art, changes in demand and requirements of public authorities.
Discount,
as applied to the securities issued or assumed by the utility, is the excess of the par (stated value of no-par stocks) or face value of the securities plus interest or dividends accrued at the date of the sale over the cash value of the consideration received from their sale.

Minor items of property
are the associated parts or items of which retirement units are composed.

is the salvage value of property retired less the cost of removal.
Nominally issued,
as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, are those which have been signed, certified, or otherwise executed, and placed with the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise placed in some special funds of the utility, but which have not been sold, or issued direct to trustees of sinking funds in accordance with contractual requirements.
Nominally outstanding,
as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, are those which, after being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the utility under circumstances which require them to be considered as held alive and not retired, provided, however, that securities held by trustees shall be considered as actually outstanding.
NRECA
is the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
Original cost,
as applied to electric plant, is the cost of such property to the person first devoting it to public service.

means the Rural Electrification Administration formerly an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture and predecessor agency to RUS with respect to administering certain electric and telephone loan programs.
Regional Market
is an organized energy market operated by a public utility, whether directly or through a contractual relationship with another entity.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determinations in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable:
(1) That such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or
(2) In the case of regulatory liabilities, that refunds to customers, not provided for in the other accounts, will be required.
Replacing (including replacement)
when not otherwise indicated in the context, is the construction or installation of electric plant in place of property retired, together with the removal of the property retired.
Research, Development, and Demonstration
(RD
D) includes all expenditures incurred by borrowers either directly or through another person or organization (such as a research institute, industry association, foundation, university, engineering company or similar contractor) in pursuing research, development, and demonstration activities including experiment, design, installation, construction, or operation. This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the borrower or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to, all such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of alternate sources of electricity; and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional electric power supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques, and organization; or consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature.
Retirement units
are those items of electric plant which, when retired with or without replacement, are accounted for by crediting the book cost thereof to the electric plant accounts in which included.
RUS
means the Rural Utilities Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture established pursuant to Section 232 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub.

Salvage value
is the amount received for property retired, less any expenses incurred in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale; or, if retained, the amount at which the material recovered is chargeable to materials and supplies, or other appropriate accounts.
Service life
is the time between the date electric plant is includible in electric plant in service, or electric plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.
Service value
is the difference between original cost and net salvage value of electric plant.
State
is a State admitted to the Union, the District of Columbia, and any organized Territory of the United States.
Subsidiary company
is a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See the definition of control in § 1767.10.)

(2) File with such authority, any documents or information, including without limitation, any filings associated with the borrower's rates, based upon accounting methods and principles inconsistent with the provisions of this part.
(c) If any state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over an RUS borrower prescribes accounting methods or principles for the borrower that are inconsistent with the provisions of this part, the borrower must immediately notify the Director, BAD, and provide such documents, information, and reports as RUS may request to evaluate the impact that such accounting methods or principles may have on the interests of RUS.
(1) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles do not adversely impact RUS interests, RUS will permit the borrower to use the accounting methods and principles as prescribed by the state regulatory authority to comply with the provisions of the RUS loan documents.
(2) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles may adversely impact RUS's interests, RUS may require that, for the purposes of complying with provisions of RUS loan documents, including, without limitation, those provisions relating to financial coverage standards (e.g. “TIER”), the borrower continue to maintain books, records, and accounts in accordance with this subpart.
(i) RUS may, however, approve requests by the borrower to maintain such additional books, records, and accounts as necessary to comply with the requirements of the state regulatory authority.
(ii) Such approval will not waive, modify or amend the requirements of the RUS loan documents or of this subpart.
(d) RUS borrowers will not implement the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, SFAS No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs, SFAS No. 92, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans, without the prior written approval of RUS except as provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. Requests for approval shall be addressed, in writing, to the Director, PASD. The specific deferrals set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section may be implemented without the prior written approval of RUS provided that the deferrals comply with Statement No. 71 and that the RUS borrowers implementing such deferrals continue to meet the requirements set forth in Statement No. 71 for doing so:
(1) The deferral and amortization of prior service pension costs (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 606, Pension Costs), remapping expenses (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 613, Mapping Costs), and preliminary survey and investigation charges (See § 1767.17, Interpretation No. 111, Engineering Contracts for System Planning);
(2) The deferral of any current period expense or expenses, on a cumulative basis for the fiscal year, only if a borrower would have met each of its financial tests or coverage ratios that it has covenanted with RUS to meet for that fiscal year, had the deferral not been made;
(3) The deferral of any cost that will be fully amortized within the next 12 succeeding months;
(4) The accelerated amortization of any previously deferred expense; and
(5) The deferral of revenues coincident with a moratorium imposed by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its Retirement and Security Program, provided, however, that the deferral is for the sole purpose of offsetting future pension costs.
(e) RUS will consider approval of specific departures from this part upon submission of:
(1) A detailed description of the proposed departure;
(2) The specific accounting journal entries that will be used including the account number and title, and the dollar amounts where appropriate;
(3) The total dollar amount of the departure and the impact on margins during the time period of the departure; and
(4) A resolution from the borrower's Board of Directors authorizing such action; and
(5) Any additional information RUS may deem necessary to adequately evaluate the borrower's request.
(f) RUS will, within 90 days of final receipt of this information, render a decision on the borrower's request for a departure from the prescribed RUS USoA.
(1) If, due to extenuating circumstances, RUS is unable to reach a decision within the required time period, RUS will notify the borrower of the delay within this same 90-day period, and provide a projected decision date.
(2) The requested departure from the prescribed RUS USoA must not be implemented until final approval is granted by RUS.

§ 1767.15
General instructions.
(a)
Records.
(1) Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account.
(2) Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.
(3) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
(4) No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by the rules and regulations contained in subpart D of this part.
(5) In addition to the prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
(6) When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes.
(7) The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by RUS.
(b)
Numbering system.
(1) The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:
100-199 Assets and other debits.
200-299 Liabilities and other credits.
300-399 Plant accounts.
400-432, 434-435 Income accounts.
433, 436-439 Retained earnings accounts.
440-459 Revenue accounts.
500-599 Production, transmission, and distribution expenses.
900-949 Customer accounts, customer service and informational, sales, and general and administrative expenses.
(2) In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.
(3) The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles.
(i) Each utility, however, may adopt, for its own purposes, a different system of account numbers provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry.
(ii) If a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry.
(iii) Each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available, a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein.
(iv) The utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.
(c)
Accounting period.
(1) Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month, all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility.
(2) Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly.
(3) Each utility shall close its books at the end of each fiscal year unless otherwise authorized by RUS.
(d)
Submission of questions.
To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to RUS for consideration and decision.
(e)
Item lists.
(1) Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting.
(2) The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive.
(3) The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates
inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list.
(4) The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.
(f)
Extraordinary items.
(1) Net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in § 1767.15 (g) and long-term debt as described in § 1767.15 (q).
(2) Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are not typical or customary business activities of the company shall be considered extraordinary items.
(3) They will be events and transactions of significant effect which would not be expected to recur frequently and which would not be considered as recurring factors in any evaluation of the ordinary operating processes of business.
(i) In determining significance, items of a similar nature should be considered in the aggregate.
(ii) Dissimilar items should be considered individually; however, if they are few in number, they may be considered in the aggregate.
(iii) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items.
(iv) RUS approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See Accounts 434 and 435.)
(g)
Prior period items.
(1) Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:
(i) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year
(ii) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.
(2) All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.
(h)
Unaudited items.
(1) Whenever a financial statement is required by RUS, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts.
(2) The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.
(i)
Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.
Charges to electric plant, operating expense, and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.
(j)
Payroll distribution.
(1) Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available.
(2) Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations.
(k)
Accounting on an accrual basis.
(1) The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis.
(i) This requires the inclusion, in its accounts, of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts.
(ii) If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.
(2) When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes, or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to Account 165, Prepayments,
and spread over the periods to which applicable, by credits to Account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.
(l)
Records for each plant.
(1) Separate records shall be maintained by electric plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated.
(2) The term “plant” as used herein includes each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines.
(m)
Accounting for other departments.
(1) If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas or water, it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department.
(2) It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.
(n)
Transactions with associated companies.
(1) Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies.
(2) The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.
(o)
Contingent assets and liabilities.
(1) Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain.
(2) Contingent liabilities include items which may, under certain conditions, become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its audited financial statements; its RUS Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, or its RUS Form 12, Operating Report—Financial; and at such other times as may be requested by RUS.
(p)
Separate accounts or records for each licensed project.
The accounts or records of each borrower shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license:
(1) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, and credits for property retired from service, as determined under RUS's regulations in 7 CFR chapter XVII;
(2) The charges for operation and maintenance of the project property directly assignable to the project;
(3) The credits and debits to the depreciation and amortization accounts, and the balances in such accounts; and
(4) The credits and debits to the operating revenue, income, and retained earnings accounts that can be identified with and directly assigned to the project.

# Note:
The purpose of this instruction is to insure that accounts or records are currently maintained by each borrower from which reports may be made to RUS for use in determining the net investment in each licensed project. The instruction covers only the debit and credit items appearing in the borrower's accounts which may be identified with and assigned directly to any project. In the determination of the net investment, allocations of items affecting the net investment may be required where direct assignment is not practicable.
(q)
Long-term debt: premium, discount and expense, and gain or loss on reacquisition
—(1)
Premium, discount and expense.
(i) A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the utility.
(ii) The premium will be recorded in Account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in Account 226, Unamortized
Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in Account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.
(iii) The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities.
(A) The amortization shall be charged or credited on a monthly basis with the amounts relating to discount and expense charged to Account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense.
(B) The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to Account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit.
(2)
Reacquisition, without refunding.
(i) When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and cancelled, shall be included in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate.
(ii) The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt).
(iii) The amount so amortized shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
(3)
Reacquisition, with refunding.
(i) When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate.
(ii) The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:
(A) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant;
(B) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired; or
(C) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.
(iii) Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis.
(iv) The amounts in paragraphs (q)(3)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
(4) Under methods in paragraphs (q)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issued retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs (q)(5) and (6) of this section.
(5) When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and Account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 283.
(6) When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes.
(7) When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the
tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 108), the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis.
(i) Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and Account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period.
(ii) Account 282 shall be debited and Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.
(8) The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations.
(i) In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations.
(ii) Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant.
(9) Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of Account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.
(10)
Alternate method.
Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding:
(i) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions.
(ii) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.
(r)
Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation.
(1) Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method.
(2) Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period.
(3) Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility.
(4) Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation
setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for rate making purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.
(5) Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.
(6) Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior RUS approval.
(7) Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in Accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes; 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property; 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Taxes—Other, as appropriate.
(8) The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by RUS.
(s)
Criteria for classifying leases.
(1) If, at its inception, a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease:
(i) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
(ii) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
(iii) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.
(iv) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceed 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by lessor.
(A) However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.
(B) The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.
(2) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section shall be applied for purposes of the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provision. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
(t)
Accounting for leases.
(1) All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases.
(2) The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases or Account 121, Nonutility Property;
(3) The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in Account 101.1, Account 120.6, or Account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense, or Account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense, or Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and a credit to Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations.
(4) Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.
(5) For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.
(u)
Allowances.
(1) Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (42 U.S.C. 7407 and 42 U.S.C. 7651), provides for the issuance of allowances as a means to limit the emissions of certain airborne pollutants by various entities, including utilities. Utilities owning allowances, other than those acquired for speculative purposes, shall account for such allowances at cost in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, or Account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, as appropriate. Allowances acquired for speculative purposes and identified as such in contemporaneous records at the time of purchase shall be accounted for in Account 124, Other Investments.
(2) When purchased, allowances become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and in an amount equal to the purchase price.
(3) The underlying records supporting Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be maintained in sufficient detail so as to provide the number of allowances and the related cost by vintage year.
(4) Issuances from inventory included in Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances not used in the current year shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.
(5) Account 158.1 shall be credited and Account 509, Allowances, debited so that the cost of the allowances to be remitted for the year is charged to expense monthly based on each month's emissions. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost of an allowance between months on a fractional basis.
(6) In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge Account 158.1 with the estimated cost. This estimated cost of future allowance acquisitions shall be credited to Account 158.1 and charged to Account 509 in the same accounting period as the related charge to Account 158.1. Should the actual cost of these
allowances differ from the estimated cost, the differences shall be recognized in the then-current period's inventory issuance cost.
(7) Any penalties assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency for the emission of excess pollutants shall be charged to Account 426.3, Penalties.
(8) Gains on dispositions of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in Account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to Account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to Account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances. Losses on disposition of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to Account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to Account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances. (See the definition of regulatory assets and liabilities.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.
(9) The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts used to protect the utility from the risk of unfavorable price changes (“hedging transactions”) shall be deferred in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, or Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, as appropriate. Such deferred amounts shall be included in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, in the month in which the related allowances are acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of. Where the costs or benefits of hedging transactions are not identifiable with specific allowances, the amounts shall be included in Account 158.1 when the futures contract is closed. The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts entered into as a speculating activity shall be charged or credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.
(v)
Depreciation accounting
—(1)
Method.
Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.
(2)
Service lives.
Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, and other depreciation studies.
(3)
Rate.
Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.
(w)
Accounting for other comprehensive income.
(1) Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for Account 209 so that the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account can be readily identified.
(2) When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in Account 209 to avoid double counting of that amount.
(3) When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts
182.3, Other Regulatory Assets or 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, as appropriate.
(x)
Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
(1) Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics:
(i) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.
(ii) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.
(iii) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.
(2) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in Account 175, Derivative instrument assets, or Account 244, Derivative Instrument Liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and losses recorded in Account 426.5, Other Deductions.
(3) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.
(4) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to Account 176, Derivatives in Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.
(5) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in Account 176, Derivative Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same account or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earning in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.
(y)
Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
(1) An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that
a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
(2) The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including Accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligation. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in Account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:
(i) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, Account 413, Expenses of Electric Plant Leased to Others, for electric plant leased to others, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and crediting Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations; and
(ii) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligation, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in Account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.
(3) Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:
(i) Gains shall be credited to Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, and;
(ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant.
(4) Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:
(i) Gains shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and;
(ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.
(5) For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.
[58 FR 59825, Nov. 10, 1993, as amended at 73 FR 30280, May 27, 2008]
§ 1767.16
Electric plant instructions.
(a)
Classification of electric plant at effective date of system of accounts.
(1) The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the
balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.
(2) The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the USoA in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a USoA, or under accounting practices previously followed.
(3) The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from date of acquisition, shall be entered in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments.
(4) Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under Sec. 1767.15(s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, as appropriate.
(b)
Electric plant to be recorded at cost.
(1) All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under § 1767.15 (s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Lease, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph (b).
(2) When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, the definition of cost in § 1767.10). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish RUS the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.
(3) When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.
(4) The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a credit.
(c)

# Note:
The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools and implements, shall not be charged to utility plant accounts unless the correctness of the accounting therefor is verified by current inventories. The cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of such items, or, if such items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost shall be included as part of the cost of the construction.
(4)
Transportation
includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See Item in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.)
(5)

includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the court and legal costs directly related thereto, other than law expenses included in “Protection,” Item in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, and in Injuries and damages, Item in paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(16)
Taxes
includes taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service.
(17)
Allowance for funds used during construction
includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed, without prior approval of RUS, allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in Item in paragraph (c)(17)(i) of this section. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned.
(i) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be:
EC16SE91.004
Where:
A
i
= Gross allowance for borrowed funds used during construction rate.
A
c
= Allowance for other funds used during construction rate.
S = Average short-term debt.
s = Short-term debt interest rate.
D = Long-term debt.
d = Long-term debt interest rate.
P = Preferred stock.
p = Preferred stock cost rate.
C = Patronage capital assigned.
c = Entity's incremental borrowing rate.
W = Average balance in construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication, less asset retirement costs related to plant under construction.
(ii) The rate shall be determined annually.
(A) The balance for long-term debt, preferred stock, and patronage capital assigned shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year.
(B) The cost rate for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost.
(C) The cost rate for patronage capital assigned shall be the entity's incremental borrowing rate.
(D) The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available.

# Note:
When only a portion of a plant or project is placed in operation or is completed and ready for service but the construction work as a whole is incomplete, that part of the cost of the property placed in operation or ready for service shall be treated as “Electric Plant in Service,” and an allowance for funds used during construction thereon as a charge to construction shall cease. Allowance for funds used during construction on that part of the cost of the plant which is incomplete may continue to be charged to construction until such time as it is placed in operation or is ready for service, except as limited in Item in paragraph (c)(17) of this section.
(18)
Earnings and expenses during construction.
The earnings and expenses during construction shall constitute a component of construction costs.
(i) The earnings shall include revenues received or earned for power produced by generating plants during the construction period and sold or used by the utility.
(A) Where such power is sold to an independent purchaser before intermingling with power generated by other plants, the credit shall consist of the selling price of the energy.
(B) Where the power generated by a plant under construction is delivered to the utility's electric system for distribution and sale, or is delivered to an associated company, or is delivered to and used by the utility for purposes other than distribution and sale (for manufacturing or industrial use, for example), the credit shall be the fair value of the energy so delivered.
(C) Revenue shall also include rentals for lands, buildings, and other property, and miscellaneous receipts not properly includible in other accounts.
(ii) Expenses shall consist of the cost of operating the power plant, and other costs incident to the production and delivery of the power for which construction is credited under paragraph (c)(18)(i) of this section, including the cost of repairs and other expenses of operating and maintaining lands, buildings, and other property, and other miscellaneous and like expenses not properly includible in other accounts.
(19)
Training costs.
(i) When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost.
(ii) Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See § 1767.17 (d).)
(20)
Studies.
(i) Studies include the costs of studies such as nuclear operational, safety, or seismic studies, or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to plant under construction.
(ii) Studies relative to facilities in service shall be charged to Account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.
(21) Asset retirement. The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.
(d)
Overhead construction costs.
(1) All overhead construction costs, such as
engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision performed by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts as the time the property is retired.
(2) As far as practicable, the determination of payroll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof.
(i) Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized.
(ii) The addition to direct construction cost of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.
(3) The records supporting the entries for overhead constructions costs shall be so kept as to show:
(i) The total amount of each overhead for each year;
(ii) The nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each electric plant account; and
(iii) The bases of distribution of such costs.
(e)
Electric plant purchased or sold.
(1) When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in electric plant, shall be charged to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.
(2) The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows:
(i) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate electric plant in service accounts and to Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use; and Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, as appropriate.
(ii) The depreciation and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased shall be charged to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization.
(iii) The cost to the utility of any property includible in Account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.
(iv) The amount remaining in Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.
(3) If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary to substantially rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.
(4) When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to RUS.
(5) In connection with the acquisition of electric plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.
(6) When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold
or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, and the amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization and in Account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and contra entries made to Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by RUS, the difference, if any, between:
(i) The net amount of debits and credits, and
(ii) The consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in Account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or Account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See Account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.)

# Note:
In cases where existing utilities merge or consolidate because of financial or operating reasons or statutory requirements rather than as a means of transferring title of purchased properties to a new owner, the accounts of the constituent utilities, with the approval of RUS, may be combined. In the event original cost has not been determined, the resulting utility shall proceed to determine such cost as outlined herein.
(f)
Expenditures on leased property.
(1) The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the electric plant account appropriate for the class of property leased.
(i) If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to Account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant.
(ii) If the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of (1) are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.
(2) If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof.
(g)
Land and land rights.
(1) The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights, interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land.
(i) Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant.
(ii) Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited.
(2) Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account.
(i) Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account.
(ii) If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account.
(3) The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant accounts to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increase in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the
natural resources) from the sale of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or classified as plant in service, otherwise to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.
(4) Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights-of-way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year.
(i) A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record.
(ii) Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.
(5) Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, shall be included in Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, when such property has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to Account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.
(6) The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If, at the time of acquisition of an interest in land, such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and a cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of land is recorded.
(7) When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.

# Note:
Structures and improvements accounts shall be credited with the cost of coal bunkers, stacks, foundations, subways, and tunnels, the use of which has terminated with the removal of the equipment with which they are associated even though they have not been physically removed.
(i)
Equipment.
(1) The cost of equipment chargeable to the electric plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials, and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate.
(2) Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.
(3) Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as electric plant is verified by current inventories.
(i) Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts.
(ii) Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plan or department, such as production, transmission, or distribution or in “stores”, shall be charged to the plant accounts appropriate for their use.
(4) The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors or, without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.
(5) The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service.
(i) The utility shall furnish RUS with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant.
(ii) Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period.
(6) The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as
to efficiency, or performance guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase, may be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.
(j)
Additions and retirements of electric plant.
(1) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of retirement units and minor items of property.
(2) The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:
(i) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.
(3) The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:
(i) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.
(ii) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.
(iii) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.
(4) The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done, it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.
(5) The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land accounts. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, when the
property has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to Accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.
(6) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to Account 108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant in Service. Any amounts which, by approval or order of RUS, are charged to Account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to Account 108.
(7) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in Account 302, Franchises and Consents, and Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of Account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Utility Plant in Service; Account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant; and Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant.
(k)
Work order and property record system required.
(1) Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.
(2) Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.
(3) Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.
(l)
Transfers of property.
When property is transferred from one electric plant account to another, from one utility department to another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or area to another, to or from Account 101, Electric Plant in Service; Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and Account 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.
(m)
Common utility plant.
(1) If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of RUS, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.”
(2) The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in Account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in Accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in Paragraphs C and B of Accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to the detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.
(3) The utility shall be prepared to show, at any time, and to report to RUS annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the book cost of common utility plant, the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and the basis of the allocation.
(4) The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.
(5) The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.
(n)

Work Order Procedures

# 101 Work Order Procedures
When a minor item of property is removed from service and not replaced, a retirement work order is not required except in the case of a conductor. The cost of the minor item shall remain in the appropriate plant account until the retirement unit, of which it is a part, is retired. However, as conductor is recorded in feet and is not part of any specific retirement unit, conductor shall be retired even though the amount taken down and not replaced is less than a retirement unit (two spans).
When minor items of plant are removed and not replaced, material salvaged shall be recorded on a material salvage ticket. Items of material recorded on this ticket shall be charged to the materials and supplies account and credited in the miscellaneous columns of the Materials Register to the Accumulated Provision for Depreciation. In this example, it is assumed that the cost of removal is nil. If, however, costs are incurred during the removal of minor items of plant, these costs shall reduce the credit to the Accumulated Provision for Depreciation.
When a staking sheet supporting a single work order reflects a combination of new construction and replacements, or system improvements, the predominant cost shall be the governing factor in determining the amount of cost RUS will finance. To illustrate, assume that a service is to be run to a new home near the end of an existing line. On inspection, the pole from which the service is to be run is found to be in very poor physical condition and must be replaced. In addition, a single span of wire and a service are presently connected to this pole which serve no purpose. The home originally served has been demolished and the existing span, pole, and service were retired. In other
words, what started out to be simply the installation of a new service now includes the retirement of a span of wire, a pole, and a service; the replacement of a pole; and the running of a new service. Assuming the replacement of the pole is the costliest part of this project, the construction and retirement activity shall be classified as an ordinary replacement even though the work includes new construction and retirements without replacement.

# 102 Line Conversion
If it is necessary to move a conductor from one location to another on a pole assembly during the conversion of a line from one phase to another phase, the cost of moving the conductor is capitalizable as a system improvement.

# 103 Sacrificial Anodes and the Replacement of a Neutral
Many utilities conduct studies to determine whether sacrificial anodes are needed to protect underground cable against corrosion. The following procedures shall be followed to account for sacrificial anodes and the replacement of a neutral:
1. If the study results in the installation of sacrificial anodes, the cost of the study shall be capitalized to Account 367, Underground Conductors and Devices. If the study does not result in the installation of anodes, the cost shall be charged to Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines.
2. Costs incurred in the first installation are capitalizable even though anodes are considered minor items of property. However, only the first costs of installation shall be capitalized. All subsequent replacements of anodes shall be expensed.
3. Sacrificial anodes do not constitute a record unit; therefore, the cost of anodes shall be added to the cost of the underground cable unit.
4. Because a neutral is part of an underground cable record unit, and is not, in and of itself, a record unit, the cost to replace a corroded neutral shall be charged to Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines.

# 104 Terminal Facilities
Borrowers are sometimes required to construct terminal facilities in the transmission line of another utility in order to receive power from their power supplier. The document executed between the borrower and the utility is normally referred to as a “License Agreement”. The license agreement may stipulate that certain items of the terminal facilities are to be transferred to, and become the property of, the other utility upon completion of the construction. The accounting for this type of transaction shall be as follows:
1. All construction costs incurred shall be charged to a work order. Upon completion of the construction and accumulation of all costs, the cost of the facilities that become the property of another utility shall be transferred from construction work-in-progress to Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant. The cost of the plant for which the borrower retains title shall be charged to the appropriate plant accounts.
2. The cost of the facilities recorded in Account 303 shall be amortized to Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant, over the contract term or the estimated useful service life of the plant, whichever is shorter. If the related contract or contracts for this power supply are terminated, the unamortized balance shall be expensed, in the current period, in Account 557.

# 105 Pole Top Disconnect Switch
The installation of pole top service disconnect switches, where title is retained by the utility, shall be capitalized in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises. If a switch cabinet is purchased with a current transformer included as an integral part of the cabinet, the entire cost of the switch shall be charged to Account 371. If the current transformer is installed outside of the switch cabinet, the transformer, meter, and meter base, together with the first installation costs, shall be capitalized, upon purchase, in Account 370, Meters.
Payments received from the customer toward construction costs shall be credited to Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises. Such payments, together with any amount not financed by RUS, shall be entered in column 9 of the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders. The associated maintenance costs shall be charged to Account 587, Customer Installations Expenses, or to Account 597, Maintenance of Meters, as appropriate.
When pole top disconnect switches are installed and title is held by the customer, the cost of the material shall be charged to Account 456, Other Electric Revenues and the receipts from the sale of line material shall be credited to Account 456. The portion of the receipts for resale material as well as that for installation shall be credited to Account 415, Revenues from Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work. The cost of resale material sold and the cost of installation shall be charged to Account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing and Contract Work.
Future maintenance costs incurred by the cooperative that are not billed to the customer shall be charged to Account 587, Customer Installations Expenses.

# 106 Steel Pole Reinforcers
The cost associated with the purchase and installation of steel pole reinforcers shall be charged to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines.

# 107 Mobile Substations
Mobile substations shall be accounted for in a manner similar to that for a spare and are, therefore, included as part of transmission or distribution station equipment, depending upon the use of the mobile substation. The mobile substation, together with the trailer on which it is permanently mounted, shall be capitalized upon purchase. A general purpose truck or tractor used to relocate a mobile substation and trailer shall be classified as transportation equipment.
The composite depreciation rate used for transmission plant or distribution plant, as appropriate, shall be applied to the mobile substation.

# 108 Security Lights
Where a pole supports both a secondary wire and a security light, the cost of the pole shall be charged to Account 364, Poles, Towers, and Fixtures, even though the plant investment in security lights is recorded in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises.

# 109 Joint Use
There are many cases in which an electric utility and a communications utility enter into an agreement that provides for joint use of poles. Under the terms of these agreements, either utility may occupy the poles of the other upon payment of a stipulated annual rental. If such joint occupancy necessitates the use of a higher than standard pole, the new pole shall be provided at the expense of the utility having the need for the higher pole.
When an electric utility replaces, at its own expense, a standard pole belonging to the communications utility with a higher pole, the cost of the higher pole, less net salvage (if any) of the pole replaced, shall be charged to the account in which the pole rental is included.
Contributions made to an electric utility by a communications utility for the costs incurred in stubbing joint use electric poles shall be credited to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines. The cost of pole stubbing on electric plant distribution facilities shall be charged to Account 593.
An investment in outside plant that is held in joint ownership shall be recorded in the appropriate plant accounts at its cost to the utility. For continuing property record purposes, jointly owned property units shall be priced at their cost to the utility and shall be appropriately segregated in the CPRs to indicate joint ownership.

# 110 First Clearing and Grading of Land and Rights of Way
Utility accounting practice requires the costs associated with the first clearing and grading of land and rights of way and any resulting damage thereto, to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements or equipment to which such costs relate. Since the first clearing, as well as clearing which is “directly occasioned by the building of a structure,” is done, not for the purpose of enhancing the value of the land or the rights of way, but for the purpose of constructing plant, these costs are more directly related to the construction of plant than to the purchase of land or rights of way. The accounts shall be charged as follows:
1. For overhead transmission pole lines, Account 356, Overhead Conductors and Devices;
2. For overhead distribution lines, Account 365, Overhead Conductors and Devices; and
3. For underground distribution lines, Account 366, Underground Conduit, for a conduit installation; or Account 367, Underground Conductors and Devices, for a direct burial installation.

# 111 Engineering Contracts for System Planning
Engineering costs for long-range system plans shall be charged to Account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges, as incurred. The cost of engineering services incurred in preparing a long-range system plan represents a legitimate component of the total cost of construction of all system improvements detailed in the plan. The amount of engineering costs to be associated with any specific system improvement is the annual costs incurred up to the time of the allocation (not previously allocated), plus that portion of the initial cost which relates to the particular construction in question. If any major system improvement included in the engineering plan is not constructed, or if the study is superseded by another complete study, the cost of that portion of the original study not resulting in construction shall be charged to Account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, if the costs are to be recovered through future rates. Costs recorded in Account 182.2 shall be amortized to Account 407, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, as the costs are recovered through the rates. Any costs included in Account 182.2 that are disallowed for rate-making purposes shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.
The allocation of engineering services to the various construction projects requires
the exercise of judgment. In some cases, system improvements are continuous over a period of months or years, thus permitting the engineering cost to be spread monthly as overhead in relation to the direct costs incurred in construction. (If a substantial amount of retirement work is performed in connection with system improvements, a proportionate share of the engineering cost shall be allocated on the basis of direct retirement labor.) If the system improvements detailed in the plan are not performed in a continuous manner, the engineering cost shall be allocated on the basis of the estimated costs of the various larger system improvement projects which result from the long-range plan.
If construction is performed by contract, the engineering cost applicable thereto shall be transferred from Account 183 to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric, and thereby spread to the appropriate plant accounts on the basis of contract costs.
In the case of system improvement construction performed on the basis of work orders, engineering costs shall be transferred to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric, and included in total work order costs as either overhead or special services. If engineering services are not readily identifiable with individual work orders, they shall be capitalized as overhead. If engineering costs for each work order are readily separable from the engineering costs for all other work orders, they shall be capitalized as special services.
In summarizing system improvement work orders on the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders, the amount of engineering costs previously approved for advance on the long range plan, if any, shall be deducted to determine the balance of loan funds subject to advance by RUS.

# 112 Determination of Availability of Service
Costs relating to the determination of availability of service, rates, and similar items for individual applicants shall be charged to Account 912, Demonstrating and Selling Expenses. If it is expected that construction will result, the costs incurred to provide service, including staking, shall be charged to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric. If construction does not result, Account 107 shall be credited and Account 426.5, Other Deductions, shall be charged.

# 113 Temporary Facilities (Services)
Plant installed for temporary use, a period of less than 1.ar, shall be recorded in Account 185, Temporary Facilities, net of any payments received from customers. Upon retirement, this net cost plus cost of removal, less any salvage value, shall be cleared to Account 451, Miscellaneous Service Revenues.
When a temporary service is installed at the site of a building under construction, the location of the permanent service entrance and the load and its characteristics are usually known. The temporary service is of the proper capacity and is so located or has sufficient slack, that it can be relocated to serve the new building as a permanent service. Under these conditions, the service shall be charged to Account 369, Services, when first installed. The cost of moving and attaching the service to the permanent service entrance shall be charged to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines or Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines, as appropriate.

# 114 Construction Work-in-Progress Damaged or Destroyed by Storm
When installed plant, not yet completed or completed but not yet placed in service, has been damaged or destroyed by storm, the cost of the repair and restoration shall be added to the cost of construction and capitalized if the plant was constructed under force account or work order construction, and the utility paid for the cost of the repairs. If the plant was constructed under contract, the contractor is required to deliver the plant in new condition. Therefore, any repairs required prior to the completion of construction and acceptance by the utility, are ordinarily borne by the contractor.

# 115 Liquidated Damages
Liquidated damages are amounts paid by or assessed against contractors for the completion of construction after an agreed upon date. Liquidated damages shall be credited to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric. Since these damages accrue during the construction period, they become one of the components of construction cost. Even though a portion of these damages may compensate the utility for costs which are not “identifiable,” no portion of the damages shall be credited to revenue or expense.
When a contractor has been paid in full from loan funds or from funds to be reimbursed by loan funds without a deduction for liquidated damages, the amount of liquidated damages received shall be deposited in the Construction Fund. This amount shall be reflected by a decrease in column 5, “Total Expenditures to Date,” of the RUS Form 595, Financial Requirement and Expenditure Statement, and as an increase in column 6, “Cash Balance.” If liquidated damages are obtained by withholding an equivalent amount from the contractor's payment, the net result will be the same.

# 116 Nonrefundable Payments for Construction
Nonrefundable payments (contributions) from customers and developers for underground construction shall first be credited to Account 107.2, Construction Work-in-Progress—Force Account. When the constructed plant is unitized and distributed to the individual plant accounts, the contributions shall be credited to those plant accounts which gave rise to the contribution.
When a customer or developer furnishes a trench or other service in connection with buried plant, the cooperative shall debit Account 107.2 with the actual or estimated cost of the service performed, and account for the credit as set forth above.

# 117 Refunds of Overpayments for Materials and Equipment
Refunds of overpayments for materials and equipment previously purchased are occasionally received as the result of legal action brought against electrical suppliers for price fixing in violation of antitrust laws. Such refunds shall be accounted for as follows:
1. The refund shall first be applied to any litigation costs that were incurred.
2. Refunds for special equipment items shall be accounted for, in detail, on the Summary of Special Equipment Costs and credited against the appropriate plant accounts.
3. Other material or equipment items that were installed through work orders or a materials furnished contract shall be adjusted on an amended work order. The amended work order shall include full details of the refund.
4. Continuing property records shall be adjusted to reflect the above transactions.
5. Amounts approved for advance on the RUS Form 595, Financial Requirement and Expenditure Statement, and on the loan budget records, shall be adjusted. For special equipment items, the adjustment shall be requested in a letter to RUS. For materials installed by work order or contract, the adjustments shall be made through credits shown on the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders.
6. Refunds for material currently in stock shall be credited to Account 154, Plant Materials and Operating Supplies.
7. If the material was used in maintenance activities or operations, the refund shall be credited to the appropriate maintenance or operations expense account.
8. Refunds for materials or equipment financed from loan funds shall be deposited in the Construction Fund—Trustee Account or remitted to RUS as a special payment on a note. Other refunds shall be deposited in the general funds.

# 118 Load Control Equipment
The primary purpose of a Load Management System is to optimize load dispatch and to reduce or minimize system peaks in order to reduce purchases of power or to delay or eliminate the need for construction of new plant. A Load Management System may be used on integrated systems, or on generation, transmission, or distribution systems separately. The telemetry equipment used for data acquisition and interpretation may be included at various points on a system, such as generation, transmission, or distribution substation, switchyards or on consumers' premises.
An effective load control program should be coordinated with the G
T and requires full participation of all member distribution systems. The G
T monitors the power load of the total member distribution system to predict the time of the system's peak load. An optimal load control strategy is developed by the G
T and is passed on from the G
T computer system to the load control computer systems of the member distribution cooperatives.
The equipment at the member distribution system level is the type actually being used by an integrated power system to operate a load control program. The equipment used may vary from one integrated power system to another. The selection of equipment used is determined by the information needs of the integrated power system, and the method selected to operate the load control system.
Some equipment performs only SCADA-type functions. This equipment is included with the equipment that performs only load control functions because SCADA-type equipment is an integral part of a load control program. An effective load control strategy requires current information on loads so that member distribution systems can determine the actual loads to be shed and the duration of the load control.
The function and location of the load control equipment are the primary factors in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The following example depicts a common load control system and the associated accounting. Equipment type may vary, thereby necessitating the use of accounts not prescribed below. In all instances, however, the function and location of the equipment shall dictate the appropriate account classification.

# T Borrower
1.
Coordinating System Equipment
Coordinating System Equipment is the data acquisition, processing and control hardware and software used to coordinate the load control efforts of the member distribution system. Generally, this equipment
is dedicated to load control use and is not shared with other electric utility activities.
The purpose of the G
T load control computer system is to reduce or minimize the peak power requirements of the entire member distribution system. This involves load dispatching to control transmission circuits and breakers. The computer system for load control shall, therefore, be recorded in Account 353, Station Equipment, with the associated operating expenses recorded in Account 561, Load Dispatching, and maintenance expenses recorded in Account 570, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
2.
Coordinating System Communications Link
The G
T load control computer system is usually linked to the load control computer system for each member distribution system by a radio or telephone link that is dedicated to that purpose and is not shared with other communication activities. Under such circumstances, communications equipment shall be classified in Account 353, Station Equipment. If the communications equipment is shared with general use or voice communications equipment, however, the equipment shall be classified in Account 397, Communication Equipment.
3.
Depreciation
Load control equipment shall be recorded in separate subaccounts of the primary plant accounts detailed above and shall be depreciated based upon the owner's estimate of the equipment's useful service life.

# Distribution Borrower
1.
Member System Equipment
Member system equipment is the data acquisition, processing and control hardware and software used as a subset to the overall load control efforts by the integrated power system.
The member system computer for each distribution member system accepts the control strategy from the G
T coordinating system and develops the tables that determine the control loads that are to be shed and the duration of the load control. The member system computer for each distribution system monitors the usage at each of its delivery points. This usage data is then transmitted to the G
T coordinating system for use in developing load projects and evaluating control strategies for the integrated power system. The member system computer is generally dedicated to load control use and is not shared with other electric utility operations.
The member computer system shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. The associated operating expenses shall be recorded in Account 581, Load Dispatching, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 592, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
2.
Substation Remote Controllers
Substation Remote Controllers are located at the distribution substation. They accept control signals from the member system computer and couple the signal to the portion of the distribution system to which it is connected. Substation Remote Controllers also serve as a receiver of inbound signals from transponders located in the distribution system. They also send data back to the member system computer.
Substation Remote Controllers shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. The associated operating expenses shall be recorded in Account 582, Station Expenses, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 592, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
3.
Substation Injection Units
Substation Injection Units are used only in power line based systems and are located in distribution substations. A major function of the Substation Injection Unit is to receive load control signals from the member system computer and inject them into the power line based system to be transmitted to the Load Control Receivers. Substation Injection Units can also perform control and SCADA functions similar to those performed by Substation Remote Controllers.
Substation Injection Units shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. The associated operating expenses shall be recorded in Account 582, Station Expenses, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 592, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
4.
Remote Terminal Units
Remote Terminal Units perform electric utility SCADA functions in a distribution substation or delivery point. These functions include monitoring equipment for abnormal operating conditions, monitoring analog quantities such as conductor voltage or substation load, and controlling of certain equipment within the substation.
Remote Terminal Units shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. The associated operating expenses shall be recorded in Account 582, Station Expenses, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 592, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
5.
Line Device Transponder
A Line Device Transponder directly controls a piece of distribution apparatus, such as a voltage regulator or a power factor correction capacitor, located on a distribution feeder and not accessible to a Remote Terminal Unit. The Line Device Transponder actuates the control functions and reports back to the member system computer upon completion of the requested action. This transponder is located at the site of the distribution apparatus being controlled.
Line Device Transponders shall be recorded in Account 368, Line Transformers. The associated operating expense shall be recorded in Account 583, Overhead Line Expenses, or Account 584, Underground Line Expenses, as appropriate, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 595, Maintenance of Line Transformers.
6.
Communications Verification Transponders
Communication Verification Transponders are used to respond to inquiries from Substation Remote Controllers. In power line based systems, these transponders are used to verify the performance of the communications system. They are also used during adverse system operations to isolate sections of the distribution system that are experiencing an outage.
Communication Verification Transponders shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. The associated operating expenses shall be recorded in Account 582, Station Expenses, and maintenance expenses shall be recorded in Account 592, Maintenance of Station Equipment.
7.
Load Control Receivers
The Load Control Receiver, also known as a load control switch, is located at the site of the consumer's load. These receivers directly control the electric supply to an end-use appliance, such as an electric water heater, central air conditioning compressor, or irrigation pump. The amount of time that an appliance will be turned off by the load control receiver is preset. When the member system computer determines that load shedding is necessary, it sends a signal to the communication link which then sends signals directly to the Load Control Receivers. In a power line based system, the signal from the communications link is sent by radio or telephone line to the Substation Injection Units, which then signals the Load Control Receivers to shut down the appliances for the present time. In nonpower line based systems, the signal from the communications link is sent by radio directly to the Load Control Receivers.
Load Control Receivers are located on the consumer's side of the meter. When the member distribution system retains title to the Load Control Receivers and assumes full responsibility for maintenance and replacement of the equipment, it shall be classified in Account 371, Installations on Customer's Premises. Load Control Receivers that are donated or given to consumers shall be charged to Account 908, Customer Assistance Expenses.
Operating and maintenance expenses applicable to Load Control Receivers recorded in Account 371 shall be charged to Account 587, Customer Installations Expenses, and Account 598, Maintenance of Miscellaneous Distribution Plant, respectively. Expenses applicable to Load Control Receivers donated or given to consumers shall be recorded in Account 908, Customer Assistance Expenses.
Load Control Receivers may be moved on a continual basis from one customer location to another and are, therefore, considered to be special equipment items. When ownership is maintained by the member distribution cooperative, Load Control Receivers shall be accounted for in accordance with the special equipment procedures outlined in Accounting Interpretation No. 119 of this section.
8.
Communication Links
The communication link in the member distribution systems between the Member System Computer, the Substation Remote Controllers or Substation Injection Units, Remote Terminal Units, Line Device Transponders, Communication Verification Transponders, and Load Control Receivers is usually accomplished by radio, telephone line, or power line based system. The communication links are normally dedicated to the SCADA and load control functions being served. Under such circumstances, communications equipment shall be recorded in Account 362, Station Equipment. If, however, the communication equipment used is shared with general use or voice communications equipment, the equipment shall be charged to Account 397, Communication Equipment.
9.
Depreciation
Load control equipment shall be recorded in separate subaccounts of the primary plant accounts detailed above and shall be depreciated based upon the manufacturer's estimate of the equipment's useful service life.

# 119 Special Equipment
Special Equipment items are classified separately from work order items. The USoA provides accounting that differs from that used for other types of materials. The cost of new, special equipment items shall be capitalized at the time of purchase; it shall not be charged to Account 154 as is the case with other materials. The first installation cost, as well as all incidental costs necessary to prepare the equipment for use, shall be capitalized with the material upon purchase. All subsequent costs of removing, resetting, changing, renewing oil, and repairing constitute operations and maintenance expenses. The capitalized cost of special equipment items, including the first installation, shall be removed from the electric plant accounts only when the items are abandoned or retired from the system. Borrowers may request a waiver from the special equipment accounting requirements as described later in this section.
Special Equipment Items include the following:
1. Reclosers and Sectionalizers recorded in Account 365, Conductor and Devices
2. Transformers, Capacitors and Voltage Regulators recorded in Account 368, Line Transformers
3. Meters, Meter Sockets, current and potential transformers, and other metering equipment recorded in Account 370, Meters.
4. Load Control Devices recorded in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises (See Interpretation No. 118)

# Note:
Equipment installed in a substation is not considered special equipment.
Special equipment items which are classified as nonusable shall be segregated in the warehouse and retired from service. The Summary of Special Equipment Costs shall be retitled Summary of Special Equipment Costs Retired and used for this purpose. A journal entry reflecting this information shall be prepared and posted to the books. Since loan funds for special equipment, including first installation costs, are approved for advance by the Rural Development upon receipt of the borrower's written estimate of funds required, and not on the basis of an Inventory of Work Orders, it is improper to take a credit for any salvage involved in the retirement of special equipment on the Inventory of Work Orders.
Electric borrowers that wish to receive a waiver from the special equipment accounting requirements should submit a letter request to Rural Development. In order to expedite these requests the letter to Rural Development should state that the borrower will adhere to the following requirements to account for special equipment using the work order procedure rather than the special equipment accounting procedures prescribed by Rural Development:
1. New purchases of special equipment items are to be charged to Account 154, Materials and Supplies, upon purchase.
2. Labor, material and overhead costs associated with the initial installation and all subsequent installations of special equipment are recorded on construction work orders and charged to the appropriate plant accounts upon closeout of the construction work order.
3. Labor and overhead costs associated with the removal of special equipment items, whether the items removed are placed in inventory or permanently retired and disposed of, are recorded on retirement work orders and charged or credited to the depreciation reserve account upon closeout of the retirement work order.
4. The special equipment items retired and salvaged for reuse are returned to the materials and supplies account at the average material cost in the materials and supplies account and credited to the depreciation reserve upon closeout of the retirement work order.
In addition to recognition of the requirements noted above, the borrower should indicate how it plans to account for the items of special equipment that have been charged to the plant accounts but not installed (in inventory). Two acceptable methods to account for this equipment are: (1) Leave the equipment in the plant accounts until the inventory is depleted and charge only new purchases to materials and supplies, or (2) credit the plant accounts for the installed cost of the equipment in inventory, charge the equipment cost to materials and supplies, and charge the installation cost to the appropriate operations expense account. Also, under the second method, the borrower must submit a “negative” special equipment summary to Rural Development to return to the balance in reserve for the current loan the installed cost of special equipment in inventory on the date of transition.

# 120 Meter Sockets and Meters
When a utility furnishes meter sockets, ownership by the utility of the meter socket or base, as well as the meter itself, is established by virtue of them being furnished without cost to the consumer by the cooperative. While no agreement as to ownership between the cooperative and the property owner exists, cooperative ownership is implied by long standing practice and tradition in the electric utility industry.

# 121 Minimum—Maximum Voltmeters
A minimum—maximum voltmeter is used to record the minimum and maximum voltages at a specific line location over a period of time. It is normally installed on a pole in connection with a 1
1/2
kVA transformer, a meter base and connecting wires, and other small items of materials. Meter bases are ordinarily set for these voltmeters throughout the system, and a lesser number of voltmeters are rotated among them periodically to obtain voltage readings. An average system may have one voltmeter to two installations, with a maximum of 20 or 25 voltmeters for the whole system.
Minimum—maximum voltmeters shall be recorded, through work orders, in Account 370, Meters, when installed. The cost of the transformers shall remain in Account 368, Line Transformers, with the cost of the meter bases remaining in Account 370, Meters. The miscellaneous material used in installing the transformer and the meter base shall be charged to Account 370, Meters.
Maintenance expense shall be charged to either Account 595, Maintenance of Line Transformers, or Account 597, Maintenance of Meters, as appropriate. Costs associated with reading the voltmeters shall be charged to Account 583, Overhead Line Expenses, and the cost of relocating or changing the complete installation or any part thereof, other than retirement of the meter base, shall be charged to Account 583, Overhead Line Expenses, or Account 586, Meter Expenses.

# 122 Retrofitting Demand Meters
A demand meter measures the amount of electricity used over a period of time in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and indicates the maximum kilowatts (kW) required at any one time by means of a pointer.
Electronic or solid state demand meters have a direct readout which reads kilowatt demand to two decimal places. The use of a direct readout demand meter may result in increased revenues as pointer readings tend to register lower than actual usages.
The process of retrofitting a demand meter replaces the pointer with a direct readout. The cost of such a replacement is usually expensed as a minor item of property; however, since the use of a direct readout results in a substantial betterment, the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost, at current prices, of replacing the pointer without the betterment is capitalized.

# 123 Transformer Conversions
The conversion of an overhead transformer to an underground transformer constitutes a betterment and shall, therefore, be capitalized.

# 124 Transclosures
Transclosures are enclosures or cabinets in which line transformers are mounted. The cost of transclosures that are purchased separately from the transformer shall be charged to Account 154, Plant Materials and Operating Supplies, when received, and capitalized, upon installation, to Account 368, Line Transformers, as a separate unit of property. If the case and the transformer are inseparable, the unit is considered a transformer and shall be capitalized upon purchase.

# 125 Retirement Units

# Services
A retirement unit shall consist of a complete service rather than the individual wires comprising that service. If each separate wire of a service were treated as a retirement unit, the retirement unit would represent a comparatively small cost. Such a small unit of property would substantially increase the number of retirement work orders. The complete service shall, therefore, be considered a retirement unit.

# Minor Items
When minor items of property are added separately from complete retirement units, the costs of these items shall be included in work orders, and by unitizing all costs of completed construction for a month, these minor items shall be spread to the retirement units of which they normally form a part. For example, to convert a two-phase line to a three-phase line requires the addition of a conductor, an insulator and a pole-top pin. A pole-top pin is typically capitalized as a component of the cost of the pole to which it is attached. Assuming this is the only work order for the month, the cost of this pin shall be charged to the conductor, so that its cost is included in the total cost of the project. In actual practice, however, this does not happen as it is normal to have a number of work orders for a given month, which include the setting of poles. In allocating the cost of all construction projects for the month, part of the cost of pole-top pins shall be allocated to poles even though the work orders on which they were capitalized did not include poles.
The retirement and replacement of isolated single retirement units cannot be charged to maintenance; a retirement and construction work order shall be used.

# 126 Establishment of Continuing Property Records
The costs of installing a system of continuing property records shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses, and may include:
1. Labor and expenses incurred in developing an inventory of property;
2. Labor and material costs incurred in connection with developing pole records including map preparation and pole cards; and
3. Labor and material costs (ledger sheets, etc.) incurred in connection with the installation of the record system.

# 127 Continuing Property Records for Buildings
When establishing continuing property records for a building where there is no detailed breakdown of contract costs, it is necessary to estimate the cost of the each component part. It should be noted that the establishment of continuing property records is not required for buildings; however, if CPRs are not maintained, all repairs including the replacement of major component parts shall be expensed in the period incurred.

# 128 Sale of Property
All proceeds deposited in the Construction Fund account from the sale of property, regardless of materiality, shall be reflected on the RUS Form 595, Financial Requirement and Expenditure Statement. Proceeds from the sale of property shall be reported on the Form 595, by budget purpose, as a reduction in total expenditures to date, column 5; and an increase in the cash balance, column 6.
Proceeds from the sale of property shall not be used to maintain an “Employee Fund.” A utility may, pursuant to board policy, use general funds for employee welfare equivalent in amount to proceeds received from the sale of scrap property. If general
funds, in an amount equivalent to proceeds received from the sale of scrap property, are used for employee welfare, Account 926, Employee Pensions and Benefits, shall be charged.

# 129 Gain or Loss on the Sale of an Office Building
A gain on the sale of an office building shall be recorded in Account 421.1, Gain on the Disposition of Property, with a loss recorded in Account 421.2, Loss on the Disposition of Property. If the gain or loss will materially distort current year's net margins, such gain or loss is reportable as an extraordinary item in Account 434, Extraordinary Income, or Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions.

# 130 Salvage and Obsolete Material
The value of material salvaged from the retirement of units of property reduces the loss on the retirement and shall be so applied. The value assigned to salvage shall be credited to Account 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress, which results in reducing net charges to the provision for depreciation when the work order is completed and cleared.
If salvage is sold, any difference between the realized value and the estimated value of the salvaged material shall be charged or credited to the appropriate provision for depreciation.
Salvage resulting from maintenance where no retirement units are involved shall be debited to the materials and supplies account, and credited to the appropriate maintenance account.
Occasionally a utility will have a loss due to obsolescence of materials on hand. If the loss is due to obsolescence of new material, the loss shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions. If the loss is due to obsolescence of used material, the loss shall be charged to the appropriate subaccount of Account 108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation.

# 131 Plant Acquisition Adjustments
Plant acquisition adjustments shall be amortized to the operating expense accounts. These adjustments are recorded in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, and amortized to Account 406, Amortization of Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments, or Account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, as required by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction. Accounts 406 and 425 shall be closed to operating margins.

# 132 General Plant
When the unit method of depreciation is used for general plant items, gains and losses on sales, trades or disposals of equipment shall be recorded as such. If the composite method of depreciation is used, gains or losses on the disposal of general plant items shall be recorded in the appropriate depreciation reserve account.
A truck which is used only for transporting power operated equipment mounted thereon shall be charged, together with the installed equipment, to Account 396, Power Operated Equipment. If the same type of truck is used for transporting materials and supplies, tools and work equipment, personnel, or other items, the cost of the truck shall be charged to Account 392, Transportation Equipment.
Depreciation and other expenses relating to power operated equipment shall be accumulated in a subaccount of Account 184, Clearing Accounts, and distributed monthly on an equitable basis to the accounts properly chargeable.
Depreciation expense on vehicles and other work equipment, furniture and office equipment, and other such plant used in the construction of utility plant, is a proper component of construction cost. To avoid a duplicate advance of funds, however, the amount of depreciation on such items that has previously been financed from loan funds shall be deducted from Inventories of Work Orders submitted to RUS. This amount shall be specifically identified, and shown either monthly or annually as a single item in column 9 on the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders.

# 133 Plant Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs
In December 1986, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments (Statement No. 90) and Disallowances of Plant Costs. This section provides an overview of the requirements outlined in Statement No. 90 together with the specific accounts that shall be used to record a plant abandonment or a disallowance of plant costs.

# Plant Abandonments
When an abandonment becomes probable, the cost of the abandoned asset shall be removed from Construction Work-in-Progress or Plant-in-Service, as applicable. Before making this transfer, however, a determination must be made as to whether recovery of the allowed cost is likely to be provided with a full return on the investment during the period from the time the abandonment becomes probable, to the time when recovery is completed, or with a partial or no return on the investment. This determination shall be made based upon the facts and circumstances of the specific abandonment, and past practices and current policies of regulatory jurisdiction.
If a full return on the investment is likely to be provided, any disallowance of all or part of the cost of abandoned plant that is both probable and reasonably estimated shall be recognized as a loss in the current year with the carrying basis of the asset reduced by an equal amount. The remaining cost of abandoned plant shall be recorded as a separate new asset.
If partial or no return on the investment is likely to be provided, any disallowance of abandoned plant costs that is both probable and reasonably estimated shall be recognized as a loss. The present value of the future revenues expected to be provided to recover the allowable cost of the abandoned plant and return on the investment, if any, shall be reported as a separate new asset. The discount rate used to compute the present value shall be the borrower's incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate that the borrower would have to pay to borrow an equivalent amount for a period equal to the expected recovery period. In determining the value of expected future revenues, the borrower shall consider the probable time period before the recovery is expected to begin and the probable time period over which recovery is expected to be provided.
The amount of the new asset shall be adjusted from time to time, as necessary, if new information indicates that the estimates used to record the new asset have changed. The carrying value of the new asset, however, shall not be adjusted for changes in the incremental borrowing rate. The amount of any adjustments shall be recorded as a gain or loss.
During the period between the date on which a new asset is recognized and the date on which recovery begins, the carrying amount shall be increased by accruing a carrying charge. The rate used to accrue the carrying charge shall be:
1. If a full return on the investment is likely, a rate equal to the allowed overall cost of capital in the jurisdiction in which recovery is expected to be provided shall be used.
2. If partial or no return is likely, the asset shall be amortized in a manner that will produce a constant return on the unamortized investment in the new asset equal to the rate at which the expected revenues were discounted.
Due to the nonprofit environment in which electric cooperatives operate, full recovery of interest expense on plant related long-term debt equates to full recovery of the rate of return for an investor-owned utility. Therefore, if a cooperative is permitted full recovery of the interest expense incurred on the long-term debt borrowed to finance construction of an abandoned plant, no discounting of the asset is required nor is accrual of the carrying charge permitted.
If, at the time the provisions of Statement No. 90 are first applied, the borrower elects to restate the financial statements, the financial statements for all periods presented shall be restated and the financial statements shall disclose the nature of the restatement and its effect on margins before extraordinary items, net margins, and patronage capital at the beginning of the earliest period presented. If the borrower elects not to restate the financial statements, the effect of applying Statement No. 90 shall be reported as a change in accounting principle and the financial statements shall disclose the nature of the change and the effect of applying Statement No. 90 on margins before extraordinary items and net margins.
The specific accounts that shall be used to record transactions involving plant abandonments are as follows:
1. In the year of the abandonment, the unrecoverable portion of the cost of abandoned plant included in construction work-in-progress shall be recognized as a loss by a charge to Account 426.5, Other Deductions, and a credit to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress.
2. The balance of the cost remaining in the construction work-in-progress account shall be credited to Account 107 and charged to Account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs.
3. The difference between the charge to Account 182.2 and the present value of expected future revenues for recovery of the new asset, shall be recorded as a credit to Account 182.2 and a debit to Account 426.5. The credit to Account 182.2 shall be segregated from the amount charged to Account 182.2 by the use of a separate subaccount. Statement No. 90 does not require this segregation; however, it is necessary under the USoA to provide for the appropriate segregation of operating and nonoperating income.
4. During the waiting period for recovery of the new asset to begin, carrying charges shall be accrued by a debit toAccount 182.2 with a concurrent credit to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. Debits to Account 182.2 shall be treated as reductions to the credit subaccount of Account 182.2.
5. The borrower shall amortize the amount debited to Account 182.2 by charges to operating income, consistent with the way the amortized amounts are recovered through rates. These charges to income shall be recorded in Account 407, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs.
6. As the recoverable amount recorded in Account 182.2 is recovered through rates, the borrower shall accrue income by charges to Account 182.2 and credits to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. Accruals shall be computed by applying the same rate used to derive the present value of the asset established in Account 182.2, to the
unamortized balance in that account. Accrued amounts charged to Account 182.2 shall be treated as reductions to the credit subaccount withinAccount 182.2.
Prior to implementing the accounting prescribed above, the borrower shall submit the details of each plant abandonment to RUS for approval.

# Disallowances of Costs of Recently Completed Plant
When it becomes probable that a portion of the cost of recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made, the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. If a portion of the costs is explicitly, but indirectly disallowed, the equivalent amount of the cost shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. The specific accounts that shall be used to record transactions involving the disallowance of plant costs are as follows:
1. Estimated disallowed plant costs which the borrower records as a credit to Account 101, Electric Plant-in-Service, shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.
2. If the loss qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria set forth in General Instruction No. 7 of the USoA, the borrower shall record the loss in Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. To be considered extraordinary, an item shall be more than five percent of income computed before extraordinary items. If a borrower believes that a loss of less than five percent should be treated as an extraordinary item; the borrower shall, with commission approval, record the loss in Account 435 and report the loss as an extraordinary item. If the borrower is not subject to state commission jurisdiction, RUS approval is required.

# 134 Utility Plant Phase-in Plans
In August 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 92, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans (Statement No. 92). This section provides an overview of the requirements outlined in Statement No. 92.
The term phase-in plan is used to refer to any method of recognition of allowable costs in rates that meets all of the following criteria:
1. The method was adopted by the regulator in connection with a major, newly completed plant of the regulated enterprise or one of its suppliers or a major plant scheduled for completion in the near future.
2. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs beyond the period in which those allowable costs would be charged to expense under generally accepted accounting principles applicable to enterprises in general.
3. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs beyond the period in which those rates would have been ordered under the rate-making methods routinely used prior to 1982 by that regulator for similar allowable costs of that regulated enterprise.
If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a plant on which no substantial physical construction had been performed before January 1, 1988, none of the allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan for rate-making purposes, shall be capitalized for general-purpose financial reporting purposes (financial reporting).
If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a plant completed before January 1, 1988, or a plant on which substantial physical construction had been performed before January 1, 1988, the criteria specified below shall be applied to that plan. If the phase-in plan meets all of those criteria, all allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan shall be capitalized for financial reporting purposes as a separate asset (a deferred charge). If any one of those criteria is not met, none of the allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan shall be capitalized for financial reporting. The criteria for determining whether capitalization is appropriate are:
1. The allowable costs in question are deferred pursuant to a formal plan that has been agreed to by the regulator;
2. The plan specifies the timing of recovery of all allowable costs that will be deferred under the plan;
3. All allowable costs deferred under the plan are scheduled for recovery within 10 years of the date when the deferral began; and
4. The percentage increase in rates scheduled under the plan for each future year is no greater than the percentage increase in rates scheduled under the plan for each immediately preceding year. That is, the scheduled percentage increase in year two is no greater than the percentage increase granted in year one, the scheduled percentage increase in year three is no greater than the percentage increase in year two, etc.
By definition, a phase-in plan approved prior to 1982 that contains provisions contrary to those detailed above is not subject to the provisions of Statement No. 92. This exemption, however, only relates to a specific utility and a specific regulator. For example, a utility cannot use a phase-in plan
approved by its regulator for a different utility as justification for its phase-in plan exceeding the 10-year limit imposed by Statement No. 92.
A phase-in plan is a method of rate making intended to moderate a sudden increase in rates while providing the regulated enterprise with recovery of its investment and a return on that investment during the recovery period. A disallowance is a rate-making action that prevents the regulated enterprise from recovering either some amount of its investment or some amount of return on its investment. Statement No. 90 specifies the accounting for disallowances of plant costs (see item 133 of this regulation). If a method of rate making that meets the criteria for a phase-in plan includes an indirect disallowance of plant costs, that disallowance shall be accounted for in accordance with Statement No. 90. Cumulative amounts capitalized under phase-in plans shall be reported as a separate asset in the balance sheet. The net amount capitalized in each period or the net amount of previously capitalized allowable costs recovered during each period shall be reported as a separate item of other income or expense in the income statement. Allowable costs capitalized shall not be reported as reductions of other expenses.
The terms of any phase-in plan in effect during the year or ordered for future years shall be disclosed in the financial statements. Statement No. 92 does not permit capitalization for financial reporting of allowable costs deferred for future recovery by the regulator pursuant to a phase-in plan that does not meet the criteria or a phase-in plan related to plant on which substantial physical construction was not completed before January 1, 1988. Nevertheless, the financial statements shall include disclosures of the net amount deferred at the balance sheet date for rate-making purposes, and the net change in deferrals for rate-making purposes during the year for those plans.
If the provisions of Statement No. 92 are applied retroactively, the financial statements of all periods presented shall be restated. In addition, the restated financial statements shall, in the year that Statement No. 92 is first applied, disclose the nature of any restatement and its effect on margins before extraordinary items, net margins, and on patronage capital at the beginning of the earliest period presented. If the financial statements for prior years are not restated, the effects of applying Statement No. 92 to existing phase-in plans shall be reported as a change in accounting principle and the financial statements shall disclose the effect of adopting Statement No. 92 on margins before extraordinary items and net margins.
The application of Statement No. 92 to an existing phase-in plan shall be delayed if both of the following conditions are met:
1. The enterprise has filed a rate application to have the plan amended to meet the criteria of Statement No. 92 or intends to do so as soon as practicable; and
2. It is reasonably possible that the regulator will change the terms of the phase-in plan so that it will meet the criteria of Statement No. 92.
If the above conditions are met, the provisions of Statement No. 92 shall be applied to the existing phase-in plan on the earlier of the date when one of the conditions ceases to be met or the date when the final rate order is received, amending or refusing to amend the phase-in plan. However, if the enterprise delays filing its application for the amendment or the regulator does not process the application in the normal period of time, the application of Statement No. 92 shall not be further delayed.
In applying the criteria of Statement No. 92 to a plan that was in existence prior to the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 1987, and that was revised to meet that criteria, the 10-year criterion and the requirement concerning the percentage increase shall be measured from the date of the amendment rather than from the date of the first scheduled deferrals under the original plan. All phase-in plans must receive RUS approval prior to implementation.

# 135 Accounting for Removal or Relocation of Electric Facilities Resulting from the Action of Others
Under arrangements with another party, a borrower agrees, or is obliged, to remove, relocate, rearrange, or otherwise make changes in utility property, other than for the purpose of rendering utility service to the other party, for which the utility is reimbursed for all or a portion of the costs incurred.

# Plant Accounting
The relocation of the line shall be accounted for as follows:
1. If all of the assemblies in the line are retired or completely removed and later reinstalled or if the line is constructed in a new location before the old line is removed, construction and retirement work orders shall be prepared except for the costs relating to special equipment items (transformers, oil circuit reclosers, etc.) which shall be charged to operations expense.
2. If a line is moved in its entirety to a new location except for isolated retirement units (such as at the end of the line) or poles not suitable for resetting, the cost of moving the portion of line that is moved intact shall be charged to maintenance expense while the cost related to the change in isolated retirement units or the replacement of poles not suitable for resetting shall be accounted for
through use of construction and retirement work orders.
3. If a line is moved intact without any change in assemblies, the cost shall be charged to maintenance expense.

# Reimbursement
If the borrower receives reimbursement for the costs related to the relocation of the line, the reimbursement shall be accounted for by crediting operation and maintenance expenses to the extent of actual expenses occasioned by the plant changes and crediting the remainder to the accumulated provision for depreciation, unless contractual terms definitely characterize residual or specific amounts as applicable to the cost of replacement. In the latter event, appropriate credits shall be entered in the plant accounts.
Reimbursement received from a telephone company for adding a pole or replacing a present pole with a taller pole under joint use contracts falls within this latter category. In this instance, appropriate credits are charged against the plant accounts.

# Financing
The total reimbursement, less any portion for operations and maintenance costs, shall be entered in the “Contributions in Aid of Construction” section at the bottom of the Construction Work Order. When the Inventory of Work Orders (RUS Form 219) is prepared, enter only enough of the contribution in column 9 to reduce to zero the amount in column 10, “Loan Funds Subject to Advance by RUS.” This entry is made although none of the reimbursement received is recorded in the accounting records as a contribution in aid of construction.

# 136 Storm Damage
As a result of recent hurricane, flood, and ice storm damage, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) has received several inquiries concerning the proper accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds received from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).
Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise removed from service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of property installed must be shown on construction work orders. To ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is as accurate as possible, an effort should be made to accurately accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme care has been exercised, however, it may still be necessary to use estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures.
When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above construction and retirement costs represent maintenance expense. Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines, straightening poles, and replacing minor items of property. When extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to an operating condition without delay usually results in excessive costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a guide in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are used, all excess costs are charged to maintenance expense.
Because of the storm's destruction, property is retired prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses occur. When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the year in which the losses are incurred. If the recording of such losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may be charged to Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may defer certain costs, provided such costs are included in the utility's rate base and recovered through future rates. If an RUS borrower elects to apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, RUS approval is required. To obtain RUS approval, a borrower must submit:
a. A detailed description of the plan including the nature of the expense item, the amount of the deferral, the specific time period for rate recovery, and justifying support for the time period selected;
b. The accounting journal entries being used by the cooperative to record the expense deferral and amortization of deferred costs; and
c. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the deferred costs through future rates, or in the absence of commission jurisdiction, a resolution from the cooperative's board of directors authorizing such recovery.
To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal government often provides assistance through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the restoration of facilities based upon the cost estimates submitted by the entity requesting assistance. If the FEMA grant is for less than 100 percent of the cost estimates, and does not specify offset expenses, thereby providing the borrower with the maximum opportunity to utilize Rural Development Utilities Program loan funds to finance capitalizable costs. When
the funds are received, they should be accounted for by first applying the funds received as a credit to maintenance expense and administrative and general costs. Any remaining funds should then be applied as a credit to construction and retirement costs.

# 137 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of (Statement No. 121), requires reporting entities to review all long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles that are to be held, used, or disposed of by that entity for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the asset, the entity must recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The impairment loss is reported as a component of income from continuing operations before income taxes for entities presenting an income statement and in the statement of activities of not-for-profit organizations. Statement No. 121 does not apply to assets included in the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs.

# Assets To Be Held or Used
Entities are required to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For example:
1. A significant decrease in the market value of an asset;
2. A significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used;
3. A significant physical change in an asset;
4. A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset;
5. An adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
6. An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; and
7. A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continued losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue.
The impairment of the asset is measured by estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its disposition. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Future cash flows are those cash inflows that are expected to be generated by the asset less the cash outflows expected to be necessary to maintain those inflows. If the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss must be recognized. If the expected future cash flows are greater than the carrying value of the asset, no impairment loss exists.
The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is the amount for which the asset could be bought or sold in an arms-length transaction between willing parties. A quoted market price is the best evidence of fair value. If this information is not available, the fair value should be based upon the best information available. Consideration should be given to the price of similar assets and valuation techniques such as the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate representative of the risk involved, option-pricing models, matrix pricing, option-adjusted spread models, and fundamental analysis. All available information should be considered when using the above pricing techniques.
If an impairment is recognized, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to the lower of its fair value or its carrying value and, if depreciable, depreciated over the remaining useful life. Previously recognized impairment losses cannot be restored. If the asset was acquired in a business combination and there is goodwill resulting from the transaction, the goodwill is included in the asset grouping and reduced or eliminated before any adjustment is made to the carrying value of the asset.
The following financial statement disclosures are required in the period in which the impairment is recognized:
1. A description of the impaired assets and the facts and circumstances surrounding the impairment;
2. The amount of the impairment and how fair value was determined;
3. The caption in the income statement or the statement of activities in which the impairment loss is aggregated if that loss has not been presented as a separate caption or reported parenthetically on the face of the statement; and
4. If applicable, the business segment(s) affected.

# Assets To Be Disposed
Statement No. 121 also applies to all long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for which management, having the authority to approve the action, has committed to a plan of disposal except those assets covered by APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. An asset to be disposed of is carried at the lower of its carrying amount (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) or its fair value less cost to sell.
The fair value of the asset to be disposed of is computed in the same manner as that for an asset to be held or used by the entity. Selling costs include the incremental direct cost to transact the sale—broker commissions, legal fees, title transfer, and other closing costs that must be incurred before legal title can be transferred. Costs such as insurance, security service, and utilities are generally excluded unless these costs are part of a contractual agreement that obligates the entity to incur such costs in the future. If the asset's fair value is based upon current market price or the current selling price for a similar asset, the fair value is considered a current amount and is not discounted. If, however, the fair value is based upon discounted expected future cash flows and if the sale is to occur beyond one year, the cost to sell must also be discounted. Assets covered by this statement are not depreciated (amortized) while being held for disposal.
Subsequent revisions in estimates of fair value less cost to sell are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of the asset to be disposed of as long as the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the original carrying amount.
The following financial statement disclosures are required in the period in which the impairment is recognized:
1. A description of the assets to be disposed of including the facts and circumstances leading to the expected disposal, the expected disposal date, and the carrying amount of those assets;
2. If applicable, the business segment(s) in which the assets to be disposed of are held;
3. The amount, if any, of the impairment loss resulting from the adoption of this statement;
4. The gain or loss, if any, resulting from subsequent revisions in the estimates of fair value less cost to sell;
5. The caption in the income statement or statement of activities in which the gains or losses are aggregated if those gains or losses have not been presented as a separate caption or reported parenthetically on the face of the statement; and
6. The results of operations for assets to be disposed of to the extent that those results are included in the entity's results of operations for the period and can be identified.

# Accounting Requirements
All borrowers must adopt the accounting prescribed by Statement No. 121.

# Effective Date and Implementation
Statement No. 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. Impairment losses resulting from the application of this statement to assets that are held or used by the entity must be reported in the period in which the recognition criteria are first applied and met. Impairment losses attributable to assets to be disposed of must be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes.

# Accounting Journal Entries—Implementation Date
If a borrower has impaired assets that are held or used at the implementation date, the following entry should be recorded:
Dr. 426.5, Other Deductions
Cr. 300 Series of Accounts, Plant Accounts
To record the adoption of Statement No. 121 for the impairment of assets that are held or used.
If a borrower has impaired assets to be disposed of at the implementation date, the following entry should be recorded:
Dr. 435.1, Cumulative Effect on Prior Years of a Change in Accounting Principle
Cr. 300 Series—Plant Accounts
To record the adoption of Statement No. 121 for assets that are to be disposed.

# Accounting Journal Entries—Subsequent to Implementation Date
If an asset that is either held, used or to be disposed of becomes impaired, the following entry should be recorded:
Dr. 426.5, Other Deductions
Cr. 300 Series—Plant Accounts
To record the impairment of a plant asset.
If a borrower makes a subsequent revision in the estimate of the fair value less the cost to sell of an asset to be disposed of, the following entry should be recorded:
Dr. 300 Series—Plant Accounts
Cr. 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income
To revise the fair value of an asset to be disposed.

# 138 Automatic Meter Reading Systems—Turtles
Automatic meter reading systems were developed from technology called power line carrier communication systems. One such system, developed by Hunt Technologies, Inc., is called by its brand name, the Turtle system. In addition to its function as an automated reading device, the Turtle can provide outage detection, power failure counts, and other potential applications. The current Turtle system does not have the capability for applications such as collection of load survey or interval data. A Turtle system consists of:
1. A meter reader mounted (retrofitted) inside the meter;
2. A receiver located in each substation; and
3. Monitoring and programming equipment (software and personal computer) usually located in the headquarters building.
The system transmits continuous information one way from the meter to a receiver located in the substation. The receiver constantly monitors every Turtle meter served by the substation. The substation receiver can be sized to monitor up to 3,000 Turtle meter readers at the same time. The data is then transmitted to the headquarters monitoring equipment via telephone line or an equivalent communication system.
The technical literature and other information provided by the manufacturer indicates that this system can only be used for remote meter reading, outage detection, power failure counts, and phase identification. At this time, there is no indication that the system supports other functions such as home security. Therefore, the accounting prescribed for the Turtle meter reading devices and support equipment relates only to electric utility operations.

# Accounting Requirements
The function of the equipment is the primary factor in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The components of the Turtle automatic meter reading system shall be recorded in Account 370, Meters. The cost of the meter reader encoding device and retrofitting the meter with the meter reader unit shall be capitalized to the cost of the existing meter. Any associated operating expenses shall be
charged to Account 586, Meter Expenses, with maintenance expenses charged to Account 597, Maintenance of Meters.
Separate continuing property records shall be established for the meters, either fitted or retrofitted with the device; the receiver; the personal computer; and the system software. The meters, receivers, and personal computer shall be depreciated over the manufacturer's estimated useful service life. The system software shall be depreciated over the estimated useful service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.

# 139 Global Positioning Systems
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a network of 24 satellites and their ground stations. Utilities are using this advanced technology geographic data collection system to update and modernize their system maps. GPS uses a system of satellites orbiting the earth to establish plant locations with pinpoint accuracy. By triangulating from three satellites and using radio signals to measure distances and locate items, system-wide maps can be created of the utility's service area. A field inventory is then taken of the utility's plant and plotted onto the map. The GPS consists of base station equipment, remote station equipment, the GPS program, and mapping conversion software.
All equipment associated with GPS is dedicated to the mapping effort. The base station is installed at a fixed location and ties satellite measurements into a solid local reference. The remote station is a portable receiver that is taken into the field to determine locations and is moved from site to site. The GPS program is the application software that operates the station equipment and is used by layout technicians to gather information of existing and new facilities in the field. The conversion software is used for converting the GPS and inventory information gathered in the field into a form usable by the mapping program.

# Accounting Requirements
The function and location of the equipment are the primary factors in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The components of the GPS shall be accounted for as follows:
1.
Remote and Base Station Equipment.
The cost of the equipment, both remote and fixed, shall be capitalized in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment.
2.
GPS Program and Conversion Software for Mapping.
The cost of GPS program and conversion software shall be capitalized in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment.
3.
GPS/GIS Field Inventory of System.
The cost of performing a GPS/GIS survey and field inventory of the existing system, by either a consultant or the utility's own forces, shall be charged to Account 588, Miscellaneous Distribution Expenses.

# 140 Radio-Based Automatic Meter Reading Systems
Radio-based automatic meter reading technology allows meters equipped with a low-power radio device called an ERT (Encoder, Receiver, Transmitter) to be read from a remote location. The ERT device can either be retrofitted to an existing meter or purchased installed in a new meter. The ERT device “encodes” energy consumption and transmits this information to a radio transceiver equipped handheld computer. The data collected and stored in the handheld computer is then uploaded to a billing computer using specialized software for that purpose.

# Accounting Requirements
The function of the equipment is the primary factor in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The components of the radio-based automatic meter reading system shall be recorded in Account 370, Meters. The cost of the meter reader encoding device and retrofitting the meter with the meter reader unit shall be capitalized to the cost of the existing meter. Any associated operating expenses shall be charged to Account 586, Meter Expenses, with maintenance expenses charged to Account 597, Maintenance of Meters.
Separate continuing property records shall be established for the meters, either fitted or retrofitted with the device; the handheld computer; and the upload software. The meters and handheld computer shall be depreciated over the manufacturer's estimated useful service life. The upload software shall be depreciated over the estimated useful service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.

# 201 Supplemental Financing
Many borrowers secure additional financing from sources other than RUS. CFC was established to provide a source of supplemental financing. Although the accounting provided in this section refers to CFC, it is applicable to other sources of supplemental financing as well.
1.
Membership Fees
When a membership fee is paid to CFC, the payment shall be recorded as a debit to Account 123.23, Other Investments in Associated Organizations.
2.
Subscriptions
The subscription agreement to purchase Capital Term Certificates (CTCs) is a binding obligation to pay an initial subscription in equal annual payments over the first three
years and an additional annual subscription payable in the fourth through fifteenth years.
The annual subscriptions to CFC for the fourth through fifteenth years is 2.0 percent of total operating revenues after deducting the cost of power. Using the best data available, each borrower shall estimate the amount of CTCs that are required to be purchased. Estimates are not expected to be precise and adjustments shall be made when future projections indicate a change is needed. When the agreement to purchase CTCs is made, an entry shall be recorded debiting Account 123.21, Subscriptions to Capital Term Certificates—Supplemental Financing, and crediting Account 224.11, Other Long-Term Debit—Subscriptions. When the CTCs are actually purchased, the following entries shall be recorded:
Dr. 224.11, Other Long-Term Debt—Subscriptions
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
Dr. 123.22, Investments in Capital Term Certificates—Supplemental Financing
Cr. 123.21, Subscriptions to Capital Term Certificates—Supplemental Financing
3.
Interest Receipts
Interest accrues monthly to the holder of CTCs at a rate in accordance with the terms of the CFC Invitation to Subscribe. The accrual of interest and the receipt of interest proceeds shall be recorded as follows:
Dr. 171, Interest and Dividends Receivable
Cr. 419, Interest and Dividend Income
To record the monthly accrual of interest.
Dr. 131.1, Cash—General
Cr. 171, Interest and Dividends Receivable
To record the receipt of interest proceeds from the investment in CTCs.

# Note:
Any amounts received in excess of the previous accruals shall be credited to Account 419.
Interest penalties may be charged by CFC for late payments on any subscription from the date that the payment was due to the date that the payment was actually received. Such charges shall be expensed to Account 431, Other Interest Expense.
4.
Notes
If a note is due more than one year after the date of the note, the appropriate subaccount of Account 224, Other Long-Term Debt, shall be credited. If the note is due less than one year from the date of the note, Account 231, Notes Payable, shall be credited.
When a loan from CFC has been consummated and a note is executed, Account 224.13, Supplemental Financing Notes Executed—Debit, shall be debited; and Account 224.12, Other Long-Term Debt—Supplemental Financing, credited. When a loan from another source has been consummated, Account 224.15, Notes Executed—Other—Debit, shall be debited; and Account 224.14, Other Long-Term Debt—Miscellaneous, credited.
5.
Loan Proceeds
Cash proceeds from unsecured short-term loans shall be deposited into the General Fund Account. Cash proceeds from all secured loans shall be deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account.
From two to seven percent, depending upon the class of borrower and its debt-equity ratio, of each CFC loan is applied to the purchase of Capital Term Certificates. At the time of a borrower's first requisition under the CFC loan, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 131.2, Cash—Construction Fund—Trustee
Dr. 123.22, Investments in Capital Term Certificates—Supplemental Financing
Cr. 224.13, Supplemental Financing Notes Executed—Debit
To record the requisition of funds from CFC.
6.
Capital Credits
As a result of borrowing from CFC or other lenders organized on a cooperative basis, a borrower may receive capital credit allocations. These allocations are usually based upon the borrower's participation in the lending program with participation measured by the amount of interest expense and conversion costs incurred.
To account for patronage capital allocations from cooperative lenders, the following journal entries shall be recorded:
Dr. 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives
Cr. 424, Other Capital Credits and Patronage Capital Allocations
To record the allocation of capital credits from a cooperative lender.

# Note:
If any portion of the interest expense was capitalized as a component of construction cost, a similar portion of the capital credit allocation shall be credited to construction rather than to Account 424. The portion credited to construction shall be determined by applying the percentage of interest expense charged to construction for that particular lender to the interest expense incurred for that lender.
Dr. 131.1, Cash—General
Cr. 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives
To record the cash receipt of patronage capital credits from cooperative lenders.

# 301 Forfeited Customers' Deposits
Customers may be required to make deposits to guarantee payment of amounts billed for electric service. When a customer discontinues service, the customer's deposit shall first be applied to unpaid energy bills, with the balance remitted by check to the customer. If the check is returned, it shall be voided and the original entry that was made when the check was issued shall be reversed.
Unclaimed balances of customer deposits shall remain in Account 235, Customer Deposits, until the legal liability of the cooperative to make such a refund has elapsed. When there is no further legal liability to refund the deposit and if it does not escheat to the state, it shall be transferred to Account 144, Accumulated Provision for Uncollectible Customer Accounts—Credit, retaining full information of all particulars.

# 401 Computer Software Costs
Computer software consists of programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direct the operation of the computer. Software may refer to generalized routines useful in computer operations or to programs for specific applications such as payroll.
The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides operating support for individual applications. This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs are generally furnished by the manufacturer.
Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application programs are generally written by the user installation, but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering or managerial applications.
Costs incurred with the purchase or development of computer software shall be accounted for as follows:
1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software. Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor). If the purchase invoice does not break out or assign a cost to the “generalized software,” it is appropriate to include the full amount in hardware costs. Capitalize in a separate subaccount of Account 391, all costs for applications software determined to have a service life of over one year. Depreciate the cost over the estimated useful service life of the program. This depreciation period shall not exceed five (5) years. RUS realizes, however, that there may be circumstances that justify a useful life longer than 5 years. When this is the case and it is management's intent to utilize these programs over an extended period, written justification shall be submitted to RUS for approval.
2. Expense in Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses, in the period incurred, all costs associated with the maintenance, updating, and conversion of files or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less than 1 year. Also expense in Account 921, the unamortized cost of all software determined, during the year, to be no longer used by or useful to the cooperative. Such costs that are clearly applicable to any category of operating expenses other than the administrative and general category, however, shall be included in the appropriate account in such category. In accordance with the USoA, no portion of such costs shall be capitalized to construction or retirement activities.
In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software, the following items shall be included:
a. Costs incurred for feasibility studies if they result in the purchase or development of software;
b. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the software. These costs must be specifically identifiable with the software and properly supported by time cards, invoices, or other documents; and
c. All costs incurred in “testing and debugging” the software.
Computer software costs are properly chargeable to Account 107, Construction Work in Progress, provided that the following criteria are met:
1. The computer program is specifically dedicated to performing a construction related activity, and
2. The cost of the software is itemized separate and apart from other hardware and software costs.
The cost of software programs meeting the above requirements and having an estimated useful service life in excess of 1 year shall be recorded in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortized to Account 107, Construction Work in Progress, over the estimated service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.
All costs related to training personnel in the use of software shall be expensed as incurred.
The accounting in this section is not intended to apply to immaterial amounts. When it is deemed that the costs of the recordkeeping necessary to amortize these costs outweigh the benefits to the members, software costs shall be expensed in the year incurred.
For computer costs relating to load control equipment, refer to Item 118 of this section.

# 402 Legal Expenses
Utilities may incur legal expenses which pertain to construction activities, loan activities, or general services. The proper accounting treatment for legal expenses is as follows:
1. Legal fees incurred in connection with a construction project, including the court costs directly related thereto, which can be identified and supported as such, shall be capitalized in Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress, as a cost of construction.
2. Legal fees specifically identified and properly supported as resulting from activities designed to obtain long-term debt, shall be deferred in Account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.
3. Legal fees for all other services and fees which cannot be properly identified will require expensing to either Account 417.1, Expenses of Nonutility Operations, or Account 923, Outside Services Employed, as appropriate.
To properly support the capitalization or deferral of legal fees, the attorney shall provide an itemization of services performed and the corresponding costs. Only those costs specifically identified by the attorney as being related to construction or loan activities shall be capitalized or deferred as described above.

# 403 Leases
Lease transactions shall be accounted for as either a capital lease or an operating lease depending upon whether or not the lease meets the criteria for classification as a capital lease. The definitions for capital and operating leases and the criteria used to determine which method shall be used are as follows:

# Definitions
1.
Capital Lease:
A lease that transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks inherent in the ownership of the property to the lessee, who accounts for the lease as an acquisition of an asset and the incurrence of a liability.
2.
Operating Lease:
An operating lease is a simple rental agreement which does not meet the criteria for a capital lease. Under the terms of an operating lease, the lessee records the rental payments due over the term of the lease as rent expense.

# Criteria
A lease agreement shall be classified as a capital lease if one or more of the following criteria is met:
1. Ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term;
2. The lease contains a bargain purchase option;
3. The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated useful life of the leased property; or
4. The present value of the lease payments at the inception of the lease equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair market value of the leased property.
A lease agreement qualifying as a capital lease shall be recorded in either Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases;Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases; or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, at the present value (at the beginning of the lease term) of the minimum lease payments. If, however, this amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the asset shall be recorded at its fair market value. An offsetting credit shall be recorded in Account 227, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, with the current portion recorded in Account 243, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Current. Assets recorded in Account 101.1 shall be classified separately according to the detailed accounts (301-399) provided for electric plant in service.
Monthly payments made under the lease obligation shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, or construction work-in-progress as they become payable. Similarly, the leased asset and the associated obligation shall be reduced by the current amount due.
The following journal entries shall be used by the lessee to record capital lease transactions:
Dr. 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases
Cr. 243, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Current
Cr. 227, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Noncurrent
To record the capital lease agreement.
Dr. 550, Rents
Cr. 232, Accounts Payable
Dr. 243, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Current
Cr. 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases
To record the monthly rental payment due.
Dr. 232, Accounts Payable
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the monthly lease payment.
Operating leases which are simple rental agreements do not require the recording of an asset or a liability. The entries that are required to record an operating lease by the lessee are as follows:
Dr. 550, Rents
Cr. 232, Accounts Payable
To record the monthly rental payment due.
Dr. 232, Accounts Payable
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the monthly lease payment.
For purposes of illustration, the journal entries presented in this interpretation debit Account 550, Rents. However, Account 507, Rents (steam power generation); Account 525, Rents (nuclear power generation); Account 540, Rents (hydraulic power generation); Account 550, Rents (other power production); Account 567, Rents (transmission expense); Account 589, Rents (distribution expense); and Account 931, Rents (general
and administrative), should be charged, as appropriate, depending upon the function of the equipment being leased.

# 404 Consolidated Financial Statements
In October 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (Statement No. 94). For purposes of reporting to RUS, Statement No. 94 shall be applied as follows:
1. An RUS borrower that is a subsidiary of another entity shall prepare and submit to RUS separate financial statements even though this financial information is presented in the parent's consolidated statements.
2. In those cases in which an RUS borrower has a majority-ownership in a subsidiary, the borrower must prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 94. These consolidated statements must also include supplementary schedules presenting a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for each majority-owned subsidiary included in the consolidated statements.
Although Statement No. 94 requires the consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries, Forms 7 and 12 must be prepared on a basis consistent with the equity method of accounting for investments. For distribution borrowers, this requires that the investment be shown on Form 7 in Part C, Balance Sheet, on line 7, Investments in Subsidiary Companies, or line 9, Investments in Associated Organizations—Other—General Funds, as appropriate. The result of operation is shown in Part A, Statement of Operations, on line 23, Income (Loss) from Equity Investments. For generation and transmission borrowers, the investments should be shown on Form 12, in Section C, Balance Sheet, on Line 7, Investments in Subsidiary Companies, or Line 9, Investments in Associated Organizations—Other—General Funds, as appropriate. The result of operations should be shown in Section A, Statement of Operations, on line 30, Income (Loss) from Equity Investments.

# 501 Patronage Capital Assignments
Accounting for patronage capital and margins may vary depending upon the individual cooperative's bylaws. The comments contained in this section relate to the application of the standard bylaw provisions.
The entries required, at year's end, to record patronage capital transactions where there is no major merchandising program are as follows:
Dr. 219.1, Operating Margins
Dr. 219.2, Nonoperating margins
Cr. 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable
To record the amount of patronage capital assignable.
Dr. 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable
Cr. 201.1, Patronage Capital Credits
To record the allocation of patronage capital to the patrons' accounts.
The procedure for determining the amount of patronage capital assignable to the individual patron on a total dollar basis is as follows:
1. Determine the total amount to be assigned for the year (Account 201.2).
2. Determine patronage from electric service, the total of consumers' billings (Accounts 440-447).
3. Determine the percentage factor to be used in calculating patronage capital to be credited to each consumer account. Divide “1” by “2”.
4. Determine the amount of capital to be credited to each consumer. Multiply the individual consumer's billings for the year by the percentage factor obtained in “3” above.
The procedure for determining the amount of patronage capital assignable to the individual patron on a dollar basis, less the cost of power, is as follows:
1. Determine the total amount to be assigned for the year.
2. Determine the total amount of revenue received from each classification of customers.
3. Determine the total cost of power for each classification of customers. (For example, use cost per kWh sold).
4. For each classification of customers subtract the amount obtained in “3” from the amount obtained in “2,” to obtain the total amount received, less cost of power, by classification of customers.
5. Add the amounts obtained in “4” to obtain the total amount of revenue, less cost of power.
6. Divide the total amount received, less cost of power for each classification of customers (amounts obtained in “4”), by the total amount received, less cost of power for all customers (amount obtained in “5”) to obtain the prorata percentage for each classification of customers.
7. Multiply the total amount to be allocated (amount obtained in “1”) by the prorata percentage for each classification of customers (obtained in “6”) to obtain the amount to be assigned each classification of customers.
8. Divide the amount to be assigned each classification of customers (amount obtained in “7”) by the total amount received from the classification of customers (amount obtain in “2”) to obtain the percentage factor for each classification of customers.
9. Determine the total amount received from each individual customer.
10. Multiply the total amount received from each individual customer (amount obtained in “9”) by the percentage factor for his classification (amount obtained in “8”) to obtain the amount of capital to be assigned each individual customer.
After calculating the patronage capital to be credited to each customer, there is usually a small balance remaining. This small balance shall remain in Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable, and shall be added to the amount to be assigned in the following year.
Proper records shall be maintained to support all capital credit transactions. As a minimum, these records shall show, for each patron, the amount of capital credited for each year as well as the amount and date retired for each year.
The process of transferring capital credits from the Patronage Capital Assignable accounts to the Patrons' Capital Credits Assigned accounts or to the Patrons' Capital Credits accounts and the making of entries to individual patron's records constitutes an assignment of capital credits. This holds true for recordkeeping purposes as well as from a legal point of view. This assignment shall be followed by formal notification to patrons within a reasonable period of time.
In the event that a distribution cooperative incurs a net loss, that loss shall not be allocated to its members (patrons). The loss shall be accumulated and offset by future nonoperating margins.

# 502 Patronage Capital Retirements
As the board of directors has the responsibility for determining whether the financial condition of the cooperative will permit retirement of capital credits and whether the proposed retirement complies with mortgage and bylaw provisions, the authorization for the retirement shall be set forth in the board minutes. The entries to record the general retirement of capital credits shall be as follows:
Dr. 201.1, Patronage Capital Credits
Cr. 238.1, Patronage Capital Payable
To record the board of directors' authorization to make payments of capital credits.
Dr. 238.1, Patronage Capital Payable
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General.
To record actual cash payments of capital credits.

# Note:
To provide better control over the payment of patronage capital credits, a special checking account should be established in an amount equal to the authorized general retirement. Special prenumbered checks shall be used for each general retirement of patronage capital.
To strengthen internal control and to facilitate the settlement of estates, the board should adopt a policy specifying exactly how payments of capital credits shall be made to the estates of deceased patrons. Payments made to estates shall be recorded as follows:
Dr. 201.1, Patronage Capital Credits
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the payment of capital credits when an estate is settled by refunding 100 cents on the dollar.
Dr. 201.1, Patronage Capital Credits
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
Cr. 217, Retired Capital Credits—Gain
To record the payment of capital credits when an estate is settled for less than the full amount of capital credited to the deceased customer's account.
Dr. 217, Retired Capital Credits—Gain
Cr. 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable
To record the reallocation to current patrons of the amount of the discount, if provided for in the bylaws.
If a capital credit check is returned due to an inability to locate the patron, it shall be held pending a recheck of available records to ascertain the correct address of the patron. If it is determined that the patron cannot be located, the check shall be cancelled and the amount of the check debited to Account 131.1, Cash—General, and credited to Account 217, Retired Capital Credits—Gain. If the state, however, has unclaimed property laws to which the amount is subject, the amount shall be credited to Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, until final disposition has been made. A notation shall be made in the records of the former patron to facilitate payment if his or her whereabouts is subsequently determined.
If the records show that a number of former patrons have moved and left no forwarding address, it is not necessary to prepare a capital credit retirement check for these patrons when a general retirement of capital credits is made. When setting funds aside to make a general retirement, however, appropriate amounts shall be included to cover payments due these patrons. The cooperative shall then make a reasonable effort to locate these patrons through publication of their names in the newsletter or local newspaper. If the patrons are not located, the amounts set aside and the credits to their accounts shall be handled in a manner similar to those for whom payment checks are returned.
Under the standard bylaw provisions recommended by RUS, it is not proper to use capital credits that were assigned to former patrons to liquidate their delinquent bills. When the standard bylaws are in effect and collection efforts have failed, the balance of an uncollectible bill, after application of customers deposits and membership fees, shall be charged against the accumulated provision for uncollectible accounts. If the patron has capital credits assigned to him or her, these remain untouched except for a notation to indicate the amount of the unpaid
bill. When a general retirement of capital credits is made at some future date, amounts which would otherwise be due the patron may be applied to satisfy the unpaid bill with the balance refunded to him or her.

# 503 Operating and Nonoperating Margins
Occasionally questions arise concerning the accounting for the balances in Accounts 218, Capital Gains and Losses; 219.3, Other Margins; 219.4, Other Margins and Equities-Prior Periods; 434, Extraordinary Income; and 435, Extraordinary Deductions. The balance in these accounts shall be accounted for as follows:
1. The balance in Account 219.4, Other Margins and Equities—Prior Periods, shall be transferred, at year's end, to Account 219.1 or 219.2, as appropriate. Accounts 219.1 and 219.2 are then closed to Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable, unless otherwise provided for in the bylaws.
2. The balances in Account 434, Extraordinary Income, and Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, shall be cleared to Account 219.2 at year's end.
3. The balances in Account 219.3, Other Margins, and Account 218, Capital Gains and Losses, shall remain in these accounts unless they are allocated to patrons or used to absorb future losses as provided for in the bylaws of the cooperative.
When a cooperative is engaged in a major merchandising activity, all costs properly chargeable to the merchandising activity shall be allocated as such to offset the associated revenue. Nonoperating margins generated from this source shall be prorated annually on a patronage basis and credited to those patrons accounts from whom such amounts were obtained. Merchandising activities of this nature may require a bylaw provision allowing for the allocation of margins generated by a major merchandising activity separate from other operating or nonoperating margins.
If, at the time of the adoption of the bylaw provisions for the allocation of nonoperating margins, there are prior years' losses resulting in debit balances in Accounts 218, Capital Gains and Losses; 219.1, Operating Margins; 219.2, Nonoperating Margins; or 219.3, Other Margins; the credit balances in Accounts 218, 219.2, or 219.3 resulting from prior years' operations shall be transferred, to the extent necessary, to offset such deficits. If the board determines that amounts shall be allocated to prior years' patrons, the credit balances remaining in these accounts shall be transferred to Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable.
If there are current year's losses resulting in debit balances in either Account 219.1 or 219.2, credit balances in Accounts 219.2, 219.3, and 218 shall be transferred, to the extent necessary, to offset such deficits. Remaining credit balances allocable to patrons shall be transferred to Account 1.2.

# 504 Patronage Capital from G

# T Cooperatives
When a cooperative receives capital credits from a G
T cooperative, the transaction shall be recorded by a debit to Account 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives, and a credit to Account 423, Generation and Transmission Cooperative Capital Credits. This entry shall be made priorto the closing of the cooperative's books even though, in most cases, the notice of the G
T allocation is not received until after the close of the year to which it relates. If precise information cannot be obtained from the G
T within a reasonable time, capital credits shall be recorded on an estimated basis. The difference between the estimated amount and the actual shall be recognized in the following year unless the difference is material.
A distribution cooperative shall not recognize its proportionate share of losses incurred by the G
T. G
T losses shall be accumulated and offset as provided for in the bylaws. Unlike distribution cooperatives, a G
T has the option to offset accumulated losses with future operating and/or nonoperating margins.

# 505 Patronage Capital Furnished by Other Cooperative Service Organizations
Utilities may obtain long-term and short-term loans, telephone or data processing services, or may purchase oil, gasoline, materials, insurance, and various items from cooperative or mutual enterprises. These enterprises often make patronage refunds or provide evidence that an amount equal to such a refund has been credited to the utility as an investment of capital. The refund may be in the form of cash in the year following the purchase or it may be deducted from the next invoice. The notice of patronage credited to the borrower's account may indicate that such capital may be retired at some future date upon certain conditions having been met. The following provides the accounting journal entries for these types of transactions:
1. Insurance policy refunds from mutual companies, in cash or as credits against subsequent purchases, shall be credited to the appropriate expense account. If sufficient information is not available to credit the refunds to the appropriate expense accounts, they shall be credited to Account 165, Prepayments, and reduce premiums for the current year.
2. Patronage capital allocations from cooperatives, other than mutual insurance companies, shall be credited, in the year that the allocation notice is received, to Account
424, Other Capital Credits and Patronage Allocations, or to construction work-in-progress, as appropriate. The allocation of patronage capital credits between Account 424 and construction work-in-progress shall be made on an equitable basis. For example, patronage capital allocations received from a cooperative money lender are allocated between Account 424 and construction work-in-progress based upon the ratio of interest charged to construction for that particular lender to total interest expense incurred for that lender. Patronage capital allocations received from a material supplier are allocated based upon the ratio of materials charged to construction to total materials purchased.
3. The face amount of patronage capital certificates received by the cooperative from the purchase of goods or services from cooperative money lenders (CFC), oil dealers, material suppliers, pole treating plants, communications services, and others shall be charged to either Account 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives, or Account 124, Other Investments, as appropriate. Account 123.1 shall include investments in only those cooperatives, or enterprises, that are directly related to the electric utility industry and controlled by the electric cooperatives. These include statewide cooperatives, power cooperatives, and NRECA. Other investments in oil cooperatives and insurance companies shall be charged to Account 124.

# 506 Forfeited Membership Fees
The bylaws of each cooperative prescribe certain rules and regulations concerning membership in the cooperative. Among these are provisions for forfeiture of membership fees. Some bylaws provide for application of membership fees against any unpaid accounts at the time of termination of service. Any remaining balance may be refunded to the member. Balances that cannot be refunded to the member due to an inability to locate the member or due to bylaw restriction, shall be credited to Account 208, Donated Capital, provided they do not escheat to the state. If disposition of the fees cannot be determined immediately, the amount involved shall be transferred to Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, until the determination is made.

# 601 Employee Benefits
The costs of employees' fringe benefits (hospitalization, retirement, holiday, sick and vacation pay, etc.) shall be accumulated in an appropriate clearing account and allocated monthly on the basis of payroll. Vacation costs shall be accrued monthly by appropriate credits to an accrual account. These monthly accruals shall be allocated on the basis of direct payroll costs to construction, retirement, and the applicable operations, maintenance, and administrative expense accounts.
Sick leave costs are not normally accrued unless the employee is entitled to be paid for accumulated sick leave at the termination of employment. Salary payments and the associated employee pensions and benefits and social security and other payroll taxes for an employee who is actually sick shall be charged to the same account or accounts to which his or her salary is normally charged.

# 602 Compensated Absences
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (Statement No. 43), requires employers to accrue a liability as an employee earns the right to be paid for future absences. Four criteria were established for this accrual:
1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed.
2. The obligation relates to employee rights which vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those for which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights which accumulate are those earned but unused rights to compensated absences which may be carried forward to one or more periods, subsequent to the period in which they are earned.
3. Payment of the compensation is probable.
4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
A company's liability shall be estimated based upon payments it expects to make as a result of employees' work already performed. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the company shall disclose that fact in the financial statements.
Statement No. 43 does not apply to severance or termination pay, postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, stock or stock options, group insurance, or other long-term fringe benefits.
The entries required to account for the accrual of compensated absences are as follows:
Dr. 435.1, Cumulative Effect on Prior Years of a Change in Accounting Principle
Cr. 242.3, Accrued Employees' Vacation and Holidays
To record the liability for benefits earned in prior years.
Dr. 107, Construction Work in Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work in Progress
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Cr. 242.3, Accrued Employees Vacation and Holidays
To record the liability for benefits earned in the current period.

# 603 Employee Retirement and Group Insurance
Some borrowers have group insurance or retirement plans or both for their employees. As a general rule the cost of these programs is borne partially by the cooperative and partially by its employees. The cooperative may pay the full cost in advance and recover the employee's share through payroll deductions. The accounting for these transactions is as follows:
1. The cooperative's advanced payment of premiums on insurance and retirement agreements shall be charged to Account 165, Prepayments, for the employers portion, and Account 143, Other Accounts Receivable, for the employee's portion.
2. The cost of the employer's portion of a retirement and group insurance program shall be charged to construction and retirement activities and the applicable operations, maintenance, and administrative expense accounts based upon a specific identification with employees' labor costs charged therein or, in the absence of specific employee identification, based upon direct labor dollars or direct labor hours depending upon which allocation technique provides the most equitable distribution of costs.

# 604 Deferred Compensation
Many utilities participate in the NRECA Deferred Compensation Program. Based upon the provisions of the program, the following accounting entries shall be made:
Dr. 186.XX, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits—Deferred Compensation
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To increase the deferred compensation provision by the amount of the annual deposit to NRECA's Deferred Compensation Fund.
Dr. 128, Other Special Funds—Deferred Compensation
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the annual deposit to NRECA's Deferred Compensation Fund.
Dr. Construction Work in Progress, Retirement Work in Progress, or the Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts, as appropriate.
Cr. 186.XX, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits—Deferred Compensation
To record monthly accrual of deferred compensation.

# Note:
If an employee joins the deferred compensation program during the year, use entry #1 to record the additional deposit to the NRECA Deferred Compensation Fund and increase the monthly accrual in entry #2 to reflect this deposit.
NRECA provides borrowers that participate in the deferred compensation program with an annual account statement disclosing the activity for each Homestead Fund investment including the number of shares owned, interest income, dividend income, capital gains/losses, and the value of the shares owned at statement date. Funds may be invested in the Short-term Bond Fund, the Value Fund, the Short-term Government Securities Fund, and the Daily Income Fund. Depending upon the Homestead Fund selected, invested funds may earn interest and dividend income and may experience unrealized holding gains or losses. Based upon the information provided on the annual statement, the following journal entries shall be recorded to recognize the increase or decrease in the fund assets:
Dr. 128, Other Special Funds—Deferred Compensation
Cr. 419, Interest and Dividend Income
Cr. 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income
To record an increase in the fund value as of December 31, 19xx, resulting from interest and dividend income and from unrecognized holding gains on trading securities.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record an increase in the liability to the employee resulting from an increase in the investment account.
Dr. 426.5, Other Deductions
Cr. 128, Other Special Funds—Deferred Compensation
To record a decrease in fund value as of December 31, 19xx, resulting from unrecognized holding losses on trading securities.
Dr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
Cr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
To record a decrease in the liability to the employee resulting from a decrease in the investment account.
Payments made to participating employees because of retirement or separation for other reasons shall be recorded using the following entries:
Dr. 131.1, Cash—General
Cr. 128, Other Special Funds—Deferred Compensation
To record the receipt of funds from NRECA.
and
Dr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record payment to employee for deferred compensation.
If the borrower has elected to bear the market risk of the funds which guarantee that the amount of money an employee receives will not be less than the amount of salary deferred, the following entry shall be
recorded if total payment(s) from NRECA are less than the amount of salary deferred:
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record payment to employee for deferred compensation. Payment was made because amount returned did not equal salary deferred.
Appropriate disclosure of the terms of the program shall be made in the notes to the financial statements.

# 605 Life Insurance Premium on Life of a Borrower Employee
Some borrowers insure the life of the manager and/or key employees with the borrower being named as the beneficiary. Such arrangements shall be accounted for as follows:
1. Charge Account 426.2, Life Insurance, for the net amount of the premium paid each year on the insurance policy.
2. At the anniversary date of the policy each year, charge Account 124, Other Investments, and credit Account 426.2, Life Insurance, with the amount of the annual increase in the cash surrender value of the policy; provided such increase is less than the net premium paid for that year. If the annual increase in the surrender value exceeds the net premium paid for the same year, only that portion of the surrender value increase equal to the net premium paid shall be credited to Account 426.2. The remainder is to be credited to Account 419, Interest and Dividend Income.
3. Upon retirement of the insured employee and surrender of the insurance policy, charge Account 131.1, Cash—General, and credit Account 124, Other Investments, for the amount received from the insurance company. If it is decided to grant to the retiring insured employee all, or any portion, of the cash received upon surrender of the policy, Account 926, Employee Pensions and Benefits, shall be charged and Account 131.1 credited for the amount paid to the retiring employee.
4. If the insured employee dies within his term of service, charge Account 131.1, Cash—General, for the face amount of the policy paid by the insurance company. Credit Account 124, Other Investments, for the cash surrender value previously charged thereto, and credit the remainder to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.

# 606 Pension Costs
With the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87), there have been significant changes in the accounting and reporting requirements relating to pension costs. This section will highlight the accounting and reporting requirements for the major types of pension plans. It should be noted, however, that the definitions and accounting procedures outlined in this section relate to financial accounting and they may differ from those used for tax accounting.

# Defined Benefit Pension Plans
A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that defines an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of one or more factors such as age, years of service, or compensation. In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to provide, in addition to current wages, retirement income payments in future years after the employee retires or terminates service. Generally, the amount of benefit to be paid depends upon a number of future events that are incorporated into the plan's benefit formula, after including how long the employee and any survivors live, how many years of service the employee renders, and the employee's compensation in the years immediately before retirement or termination.
Under a defined benefit plan, the determination of pension costs, assets, liabilities, and the disclosures in the financial statements require many calculations and assumptions to be made. This section provides a general overview of the accounting and reporting requirements associated with a defined benefit pension plan. Consult Statement No. 87 for guidance in making the necessary calculations and assumption.
The accounting and reporting requirements related to a defined benefit pension plan are as follows:
1. The following components shall be included in the periodic recognition of net pension cost by an employer sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan:
a. The service cost component recognized in a period shall be determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension plan formula to employee service during that period. The measurement of the service cost component requires use of an attribution method and assumptions.
b. The interest cost component recognized in a period shall be determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. Measuring the projected benefit obligation as a present value requires accrual of an interest cost at rates equal to the assumed discount rates.
c. For a funded plan, the actual return on plan assets, if any, shall be determined based upon the fair value of plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments.
d. Plan amendments (including initiation of a plan) often include provisions that grant increased benefits based upon services rendered in prior period. Because plan amendments are granted with the expectation that the employer will realize economic benefits in future period, Statement No. 87 does not
require the cost of providing such retroactive benefits (prior service cost) to be included in net periodic pension cost entirely in the year of the amendment but provides for recognition during the future service periods of those employees active at the date of the amendment who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.
The cost of retroactive benefits (including benefits that are granted to retirees) is the increase in the projected benefit obligation at the date of the amendment. Except as noted below, prior service cost shall be amortized by assigning an equal amount to each future period of service of each employee active at the date of the amendments who is expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive, the cost of retroactive plan amendments affecting benefits of inactive participants shall be amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of those participants rather than the remaining service period.
To reduce the complexity and detail of the computations required, consistent use of an alternative amortization approach that more rapidly reduces the unrecognized cost of retroactive amendments is acceptable. For example, a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan is acceptable. The alternative method used shall be disclosed.
In some situations, a history of regular plan amendments and other evidence may indicate that the period during which the employee expects to realize economic benefits from an amendment granting retroactive benefits is shorter than the entire remaining service period of the active employees. Identification of such situations requires an assessment of the individual circumstances and the substance of the particular plan situation. In those circumstances, the amortization of prior service cost shall be accelerated to reflect the more rapid expiration of the employer's economic benefits and to recognize the cost in the periods benefited.
A plan amendment can reduce rather than increase the projected benefit obligation. Such a reduction shall be used to reduce an existing unrecognized prior service cost, and the excess, if any, shall be amortized on the same basis as the cost of benefit increases.
e. Gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed and changes in assumptions. Gains and losses include amounts that have been realized. Because gains and losses may reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, the recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period in which they arise is not required.
The expected return on plan assets shall be determined based upon the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan assets shall be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than 5 years. Different ways of calculating market-related value may be used for different classes of assets but the manner of determining market-related value shall be applied consistently from year to year for each asset class.
Asset gains and losses are the differences between the actual return on assets during a period and the expected return on assets for that period. Assets gains and losses include both changes reflected in the market-related value of assets and changes not yet reflected in the market-related value (that is, the difference between the fair value of assets and the market-related value). Asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related values are not required to be amortized.
As a minimum, amortization of an unrecognized gain or loss (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) shall be included as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization shall be that excess divided by the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants shall be used instead of average remaining service life.
Any systematic method of amortization of gains and losses may be used in lieu of the minimum specified in the previous paragraph provided that the minimum is used in any period in which the minimum is greater (i.e., reduces the net balance by more), the method is applied consistently, the method is applied similarly to both gains and losses, and the method is disclosed.
The gain or loss component of net periodic pension cost shall consist of the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets and amortization of the unrecognized net gain or loss from previous periods.
2. A liability (unfunded accrued pension cost) shall be recognized if the net periodic pension cost recognized pursuant to Statement No. 87 exceeds amounts the employer has contributed to the plan. An asset (prepaid pension cost) shall be recognized if the net periodic pension cost is less than the
amounts the employer has contributed to the plan.
If the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the employer shall recognize a liability (including unfunded accrued pension cost) that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Recognition of an additional minimum liability is required if an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation exists and an asset has been recognized as a prepaid pension cost, the liability already recognized as unfunded accrued pension cost is less than the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, or no accrued or prepaid pension cost has been recognized.
If an additional minimum liability is recognized, an equal amount shall be recognized as an intangible asset, provided that the asset does not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior service cost. If an additional liability required to be recognized exceeds unrecognized prior service cost, the excess (which represents a net loss not yet recognized as a net periodic pension cost) shall be reported as a separate component (reduction) of equity.
When a new determination of the amount of additional liability is made to prepare a balance sheet, the related intangible asset and separate component of equity shall be eliminated or adjusted, as necessary.
3. An employer sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan shall disclose the following information:
a. A description of the plan including employee groups covered, type of benefit formula, funding policy, types of assets held and significant nonbenefit liabilities, if any, and the nature and effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information for all period presented.
b. The amount of net periodic pension cost for the period showing separately the service cost component, the interest cost component, the actual return on assets for the period, and the net total of other components.
c. A schedule reconciling the funded status of the plan with amounts reported in the employer's balance sheet, showing separately, the fair value of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation identifying the accumulated benefit obligation and the vested benefit obligation, the amount of unrecognized prior service cost, the amount of unrecognized net gain or loss including asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value), the amount of any remaining unrecognized net obligation or net asset existing at the date of initial application of Statement No. 87, the amount of any additional liability recognized, and the amount of net pension asset or liability recognized in the balance sheet (which is the net result of combining the previous six items).
d. The weighted-average assumed discount rate and rate of compensation increase (if applicable) used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
e. If applicable, the amount and type of securities of the employer and related parties included in plan assets, and the approximate amount of annual benefits of employees and retirees covered by annuity contracts issued by the employer and related parties. Also, if applicable, the alternative amortization periods used.
f. An employer that sponsors two or more separate defined benefit pension plans shall determine net periodic pension cost, liabilities, and assets by separately applying the provisions of Statement No. 87 to each plan. In particular, unless an employer clearly has a right to use the assets of one plan to pay benefits of another, a liability required to be recognized for one plan shall not be reduced or eliminated because another plan has assets in excess of its accumulated benefit obligation or because the employer has prepaid pension cost related to another plan.
The required disclosures may be aggregated for all of an employer's single-employer defined benefit plans, or plans may be disaggregated into groups so as to provide the most useful information. Plans with assets in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation, however, shall not be aggregated with plans that have accumulated benefit obligations that exceed plan assets.

# Annuity Contracts
An annuity contract is a contract in which an insurance company unconditionally undertakes a legal obligation to provide specified benefits to specific individuals in return for a fixed consideration or premium. An annuity contract is irrevocable and involves the transfer of significant risk from the employer to the insurance company. Some annuity contracts (participating annuity contracts) provide that the purchaser (either the plan or the employer) may participate in the experience of the insurance company. Under these contracts, the insurance company ordinarily pays dividends to the purchaser. If the substance of a participating contract is such that the employer remains subject to all or most of the risks and rewards associated with the benefit obligation covered and the assets transferred to the insurance company, that contract is not an annuity contract for purposes of Statement No. 87.
To the extent that benefits currently earned are covered by annuity contracts, the cost of these benefits shall be the cost of purchasing the contracts, except as noted below. That is, if all benefits attributed by the plan's benefits formula to service in the current period are covered by nonparticipating annuity contracts, the cost of the contracts determines the service cost component of net pension cost for that period.
Benefits provided by the pension benefit formula beyond benefits provided by annuity contracts (for example, benefits related to future compensation levels) shall be accounted for according to the provisions applicable to plans not involving insurance contracts.
Benefits covered by annuity contracts shall be excluded from the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation. Except as noted below, annuity contracts shall be excluded from plan assets.
Some annuity contracts provide that the purchaser (either the plan or the employer) may participate in the experience of the insurance company. Under these contracts, the insurance company ordinarily pays dividends to the purchaser, the effect of which is to reduce the cost of the plan. The purchase price of a participating annuity contract ordinarily is higher than the price of an equivalent contract without participation rights. The cost of the participation right shall be recognized, at the date of purchase, as an asset. In subsequent periods, the participation right shall be measured at its fair value if the contract is such that the fair value is reasonably estimable. Otherwise, the participation right shall be measured at its amortized cost (not in excess of its net realizable value), and the cost shall be amortized systematically over the expected dividend period under the contract.

# Other Contracts with Insurance Companies
Insurance contracts that are, in substance, equivalent to the purchase of annuities shall be accounted for as such. Other contracts with insurance companies shall be accounted for as investments and measured at fair value. For some contracts, the best available evidence of fair value may be contract value. If a contract has a determinable cash surrender value or conversion value, that is presumed to be its fair value.

# Defined Contribution Plans
A defined contribution pension plan is a plan that provides pension benefits in return for services rendered, provides an individual account for each participant, and has terms that specify how contributions to the individual's accounts are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the individual is to receive. Under a defined contribution plan, the pension benefits a participant will receive depend only upon the amount contributed to the participant's account, the returns earned on investments of those contributions, and forfeitures of other participants' benefits that may be allocated to the participant's account.
To the extent that a plan's defined contributions to an individual's account are to be made for periods in which that individual renders services, the net pension cost for a period shall be the contribution called for in that period. If a plan calls for contributions for periods after an individual retires or terminates, the estimated cost shall be accrued during the employee's service period.
An employer that sponsors one or more defined contribution plans shall disclose the following separately from its defined benefit plan disclosures:
1. A description of the plan(s) including employee groups covered, the basis for determining contributions, and the nature and effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information for all periods presented.
2. The amount of cost recognized during the period.
A pension plan having characteristics of both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan requires careful analysis. If the substance of the plan is to provide a defined benefit, as may be the case with some “target benefit” plans, the accounting and disclosure requirements shall be determined in accordance with the provisions applicable to a defined benefit plan.

# Multiemployer Plans
A multiemployer plan is a pension plan to which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective-bargaining agreements. A characteristic of multiemployer plans is that assets contributed by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer.
An employer participating in a multiemployer plan shall recognize as net pension cost, the required contribution for the period and shall recognize as a liability, any contributions due and unpaid. The required contribution includes both current costs and prior service costs. If an employer elects to fund prior service cost in full at the inception of the plan, the total payment becomes the employer's required contribution, and accordingly, its pension cost for the period.
The following provisions are applicable to RUS borrowers participating in a multiemployer pension plan:
1. An electric utility participating in a multiemployer plan may defer current period pension expenses if the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 (Statement No. 71), Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, are applied.
Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, pension costs may be deferred provided such costs are recovered through future rates.
2. An electric utility instituting an amendment to the NRECA Retirement and Security plan enters into a contractual agreement to pay the costs incurred (prior service pension costs) for the amendment. In such cases, the agreement is noncancelable and payable regardless of continued participation in the plan.
Since the utility is unconditionally committed to making these payments and such payments are not contingent upon the utility's continued participation in the plan, the recognition of that liability is appropriate. The costs associated with this liability shall be expensed, in their entirety, when the liability is recognized.
The accounting journal entries required to record the transactions associated with a multiemployer pension plan are as follows:

# Sample 1—Current Pension Expense
The journal entry required to record the normal costs associated with the NRECA Retirement and Security Program is as follows:
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts

Dr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
Cr. 224, Other Long-Term Debt
To record the liability to NRECA for prior service pension costs.

Dr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the payment to NRECA for prior service pension costs.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
To record the amortization of deferred prior service pension costs.
It should be noted that although the above entries relate specifically to the NRECA Retirement and Security Program, they are applicable to all multiemployer pension plans.
An employer that participates in one or more multiemployer plans shall disclose the following separately from disclosures for a single-employer plan:
1. A description of the multiemployer plan(s) including the employee groups covered, the type of benefits provided (defined benefit or defined contribution), and the nature and effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information for all periods presented.
2. The amount of cost recognized during the period.

# Multiple-Employer Plans
A multiple-employer plan is, in substance, aggregations of single-employer plans combined to pool their assets for investment purposes to reduce the cost of plan administration. Under a multiple-employer plan, assets are segregated and specifically identified to an employer. In addition, such plans may have features that allow participating employers to have different benefit formulas. Such plans shall be considered single-employer plans for financial accounting purposes and each employer's accounting shall be based upon its respective interest in the plan.

# 607 Unproductive Time
Lost time relating to construction, operations and maintenance shall be allocated on the basis of direct payroll costs to the appropriate construction, operations or maintenance accounts in the month incurred. Lost time is defined as time on duty during which productive work is not performed due to inclement weather conditions, material shortages, machine repairs, or other reasons.
If lost time attributable to construction has a material effect on the construction accounts in any one month, these costs shall be deferred and distributed over a reasonable period of time by means of a predetermined percentage based upon direct labor.

# 608 Training Costs, Attendance at Meetings, Etc.
Utilities engage in many types of training programs. Seminars are conducted for directors, managers, office managers, attorneys, engineers, and others. Bookkeepers and office managers attend accountants' meetings. Safety engineers attend safety schools and subsequently conduct regular safety meetings at the cooperative. Costs incurred for the various types of training activities shall be accounted for as follows:
1. Managers' and directors' expenses to attend the NRECA national and state conventions shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.
2. Management or engineering seminar fees, salary time attending such seminars including the associated pensions and benefits expense and payroll taxes, and the related per diem and expenses shall be charged to the functional expense accounts. Salaries paid to employees shall also be charged to the appropriate functional expense account. Fees and expenses for directors' attendance shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.
3. When the office manager, bookkeeper, or work order clerk attends a state or regional accounting meeting, their salary time and the associated employee pensions and benefits and social security and other payroll taxes shall be charged to the account to which the employees' time is ordinarily charged.
4. Employees' salary time employee and the associated pensions and benefits and social security and other payroll taxes spent attending regular safety meetings conducted by the cooperative shall be charged to the account to which the employees' time is ordinarily charged.
5. A safety engineer's salary time and the associated employee pensions and benefits and social security and other payroll taxes spent attending a statewide safety school shall be charged to Account 925, Injuries and Damages.
6. The salary time and the associated employee pensions and benefits and social security and other payroll taxes spent by a manager or line foreman conducting weekly safely meetings shall be charged to the appropriate functional expense accounts including Account 590, Maintenance, Supervision and Engineering, and Account 920, Administrative and General Services.

# 609 Maintenance and Operations
“Operations” is the general term used to describe activities involved in the delivery of electric service, by means of a distribution system, to the end user. It pertains to the use of the utility's electric plant facilities and does not include activities intended to prevent or remedy an impending or actual breakdown of those facilities. These activities are classified as maintenance.
“Maintenance” is the general term used to describe the activities involved in the upkeep and repair, but not the enlargement or improvement, of property owned or leased and operated by the company. It does not include the replacement of retirement units.

# 610 Financial Forecast
Costs incurred and salaries paid to perform a 10-year financial forecast shall be charged to Account 920, Administrative and General Salaries. Related office supplies and expenses shall be charged to Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses. When a forecast is performed by an outside consultant, the cost shall be charged to Account 923, Outside Services Employed.

# 611 Advertising Expense
The cost of advertising and the cost of informing the public about the electric cooperative's activities shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.
Most of a cooperative's advertising is instructional in nature and relates the cooperative's history and current activities. This type of advertising activity should not be confused with that directed towards the enactment of a specific law or laws directed toward obtaining a specific decision from a regulatory body. Political advertising of the
type defined above shall be charged to Account 426.4, Expenditures for Certain Civic, Political, and Related Activities.

# 612 Special Power Cost Study
A special power cost study is defined as a study to determine whether sufficient power will be available in the future. If additional power or power sources are needed, the study determines whether generation or purchase will supply the lesser cost. The study also indicates when additional power will be needed. As costs are incurred, they shall be charged to a subaccount of Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits. Upon completion of the study, the costs shall be charged to Account 557, Other Expenses, or amortized to Account 557 over a period of time not to exceed 5 years.

# 613 Mapping Costs
The purpose of posting completed work orders to system maps is to improve the operation of the system. These costs shall, therefore, be charged to Account 588, Miscellaneous Distribution Expenses. However, the cost of system mapping in the planning stage of construction is an acceptable overhead cost of the resulting construction.

# 614 Member Relations Costs
Many electric cooperatives hire employees whose duties concern a mixture of power use and member relations activities. The salaries for these employees shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses, except as provided below:
1. Account 912, Demonstrating and Selling Expenses, shall be charged with all labor, material, advertising, and other expenses incurred in promotional, demonstrating, and selling activities; the objective of which is to promote or retain the use of utility services by present or prospective customers.
2. Account 930.1, General Advertising Expenses, shall be charged with labor, material, and other expenses incurred in advertising and related activities, the cost of which by their content and purpose, are not provided for elsewhere.
3. Account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work, shall be charged with all costs specifically related to merchandising activities when the utility is engaged in a major merchandising program.
4. Account 426.4, Expenditures for Certain Civic, Political, and Related Activities, shall be charged with expenditures for the purpose of influencing public opinion with respect to the election or appointment of public officials, referenda, legislation, or ordinances (either with respect to the possible adoption of new referenda, legislation or ordinances or repeal or modification of existing referenda, legislation or ordinances); or approval, modification, or revocation of franchises; or for the purpose of influencing the decisions of public officials. Account 426.4 shall not include expenditures which are directly related to appearances before regulatory or other governmental bodies in connection with the borrower's existing or proposed operations.

# 615 Statewide Fees
Additional fees collected by a statewide association from its members for construction of a statewide building shall be charged to Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses. Any amounts that are to be repaid by the state association shall be charged to Account 143, Other Accounts Receivable, or Account 123.23, Other Investments in Associated Organizations, depending upon the terms of the repayment.

# 616 Power Supply/Distribution Cooperative Borrowings
When a power supply cooperative borrows money from a distribution cooperative as the result of a long-term loan agreement, the money shall be recorded on the books of the power supply cooperative as general funds unless restricted to a specific purpose. If restricted, the funds shall be recorded in Account 128, Other Special Funds. The resulting liability shall be recorded in Account 224, Other Long-Term Debt.
The transaction shall be charged to Account 123.23, Other Investments in Associated Organizations, on the books of the distribution cooperative.

# 617 Rate Discount Allowed by the Power Cooperative to Distribution Cooperatives Owning Connecting Transmission Lines
A distribution cooperative purchases power from a power cooperative. The distribution cooperative owns and operates the transmission line between the power cooperative's facilities and the distribution facilities. Because of this, power is sold at the standard rate at which the power cooperative sells to other distribution cooperatives who do not own their transmission lines, less a discount. The discount or reduction in rate is based upon the distribution cooperative's expense in operating and maintaining its transmission facilities. The contract between the power cooperative and the distribution cooperative must specifically state that the member shall receive a reduced rate or discount from the seller's rate to other member cooperatives.
Under this type of arrangement, the distribution cooperative shall record the cost of purchased power by charging the net amount to Account 555, Purchased Power.

# 618 Theft Losses not Covered by Insurance
Utilities may suffer losses as a result of thefts of cash, materials and supplies, equipment, or electric plant-in-service that is not covered by insurance. The charges for nominal uninsured losses shall be recorded in the following accounts:
1. Cash—Account 924, Property Insurance, shall be charged.
2. Plant materials and operating supplies—Account 163, Stores Expense Undistributed, shall be charged.
3. Equipment—Account 163, Stores Expense Undistributed, shall be charged for stores equipment; and Account 184, Transportation Expense—Clearing, for transportation and garage equipment. The appropriate miscellaneous operations or administrative expense account (Account 506, 524, 539, 549, 566, 588, 905, 910, 916, or 930.2, as appropriate) shall be charged for all other equipment.
4. Electric Plant-in-Service—A retirement work order shall be prepared for electric plant constituting a unit of property. The loss due to retirement shall be charged to Account 108.6, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Distribution Plant. If the plant does not constitute a retirement unit, the loss shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance expense account.

# 619 Self Billing
To maintain the books of accounts on an accrual basis, bills for customers who self bill and have not sent in a reading or remittance, shall be estimated. A journal entry shall be made to record the estimated revenue and kWh sold by debiting accounts receivable and crediting the appropriate revenue accounts. The estimated bill shall be posted to the customer's account and identified by an appropriate symbol indicating that it is an estimate. Reconciliation with the general ledger control is made in the usual manner.

# 620 Purchase Rebates
Some vendors from which electric cooperatives purchase plant materials and supplies and merchandise for resale are making purchase rebates based upon the quantity or dollar volume of purchases. These “quantity discounts” may be in the form of cash or credit memoranda, in the form of prepaid package travel arrangements, or a combination of such methods. The rebate shall be accounted for as a reduction in the cost of the material or appliances upon which it was based.
In some instances, the rebate may be for material or appliances that are no longer in stock or cannot be identified. If the rebate is based upon the purchase of plant materials and operating supplies that are normally charged to Account 154, Plant Materials and Operating Supplies, a credit shall be made to Account 163, Stores Expense Undistributed. If the rebate is based upon appliances and equipment held for merchandising or contract work, the credit shall be spread over the items in Account 155, Merchandise. To avoid materially distorting the cost of the remaining appliances, if a portion of the items upon which the rebate was based are no longer in stock, a portion of the credit shall be prorated to Account 416, Cost and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work, on the basis of the number of items sold to the quantity remaining in stock.
If the rebate is in the form of a travel package or travel arrangements, the value of the rebate shall be estimated and recorded as a reduction of the cost of the material or appliances upon which it was based in a manner similar to that of the cash rebates discussed above. The beneficiary of the travel or travel allowance shall be designated by or in accordance with policy established by the board of directors. The contra charge to the reduction in cost shall be to an appropriate account depending upon the relationship of the recipient to the cooperative. For employees, this shall be Account 926, Employee Pensions and Benefits; for directors or patrons, Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.

# 621 Integrity Fund
The CFC Integrity Fund was established to assist borrowers in their attempts to stop takeover bids by investor-owned utilities. A borrower makes a contribution to the Integrity Fund in the form of cash or patronage capital refunds. CFC retains the contribution for a 5-year period during which time the borrower earns interest on the balance in its account. Each year, the borrower receives a statement indicating (both for the total fund and the individual borrower's share) the amount contributed, interest earned, disbursements made, and the ending balance. The disbursements from the fund are allocated to each contributing borrower's account based upon their individual account balances. At the end of the 5-year period, the balance in the account, if any, is refunded to the contributing borrower.
Since the contributing borrower will receive a refund only if its funds are not totally disbursed, the contribution shall be charged to expense in Account 426.1, Donations. If any part of the contribution is returned at the end of the 5-year period, the refund shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.

# 622 In-Substance Defeasance
An in-substance defeasance has been defined as the process whereby a debtor irrevocably places cash or other assets in a trust to be used solely for the purpose of satisfying
scheduled payments of both principal and interest related to a specific debt obligation. Under the structural arrangements of an in-substance defeasance, the probability that the debtor will be required to make additional future debt payments is remote. In these specific circumstances, debt has been determined to be extinguished even though the debtor has not been legally released from his obligations under the debt instrument.
The trust established in a defeasance transaction is restricted as to the nature of the assets held. The trust must be funded with monetary assets that are essentially risk free as to the amount, timing, and collection of interest and principal. For debt denominated in United States dollars, “risk free” assets are limited to:
1. Direct obligations of the United States government;
2. Obligations guaranteed by the United States government; and
3. Securities that are backed by United States government obligations as collateral under an arrangement by which the interest and principal payments on the collateral, flow immediately through to the holder of the security.
The monetary assets of the trust must provide cash flows sufficient to coincide with the scheduled interest and principal payments on the defeased debt. If the trust is expected to pay the costs associated with the defeasance, such as trustee fees, these costs must be considered in determining the amount of funds required by the trust.
The principles of in-substance defeasance apply only to debt with specific maturities and fixed payment schedules and, as such, do not apply to debt with variable terms in which advance determination of debt service requirements is not possible.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) address the extinguishment of debt in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 26, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 76, Extinguishment of Debt. In accordance with these two statements, debt which has been defeased remains recorded in the regulated books of account as do the assets placed in the irrevocable trust. They are not, however, recognized as an asset and liability for financial reporting purposes. The transaction, including the total amount of debt outstanding and the total amount of debt that is considered extinguished at the end of the period, must be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements as long as the debt remains outstanding.
Debt is frequently extinguished before its scheduled maturity. Debt may be extinguished by the use of the borrower's general funds, or by the reacquisition of another debt issue at a different interest rate or varying terms. As these assets are expected to be revenue producing during those years, both the assets and the revenue they generate may be utilized to meet maturing debt payments. Therefore, in most instances, the dollar value of the assets initially placed in the trust do not equal the dollar value of the outstanding principal balance. The difference represents an “economic ” gain or loss to the borrower.
To provide consistency in reporting among all RUS borrowers, any gain or loss that is recognized for financial statement purposes should be reported in accordance with the provisions of General Instruction No. 17 of this part. Therefore, the gain or loss should be amortized (for reporting purposes) in equal monthly amounts over the remaining life of the original debt issue or the remaining life of the new issue. The gain or loss may be reported in the current period only in those instances in which it is immaterial to the financial statements.
The RUS Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, and the RUS Form 12, Operating Report—Financial, must, however, reflect the actual amounts recorded in the books and records of the borrower.

# 623 Satellite or Cable Television Services
Many electric borrowers have become involved in either providing satellite or cable television services or obtaining satellite or cable television services for their own use. This section outlines the accounting to be followed when recording transactions involving satellite or cable television services.
1.
Separate Subsidiary
If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services through a separate subsidiary, the investment in the subsidiary shall be recorded in Account 123.11, Investment in Subsidiary Companies. The net income or loss of the subsidiary shall be debited or credited to Account 123.11, as appropriate, with an offsetting entry to Account 418.1, Equity in Earnings of Subsidiary Companies.
2.
Segment of Current Operations
If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services as part of its normal operations, the investment in satellite or cable television equipment shall be recorded in Account 121, Nonutility Property. All income associated with these services shall be recorded in Account 417, Revenues from Nonutility Operations, and the associated expenses shall be charged to Account 417.1, Expenses of Nonutility Operations.
3.
Sale and Installation of Satellite or Cable Television Equipment
If a borrower sells or installs satellite or cable television equipment, the equipment purchased for resale shall be recorded in Account 156, Other Materials and Supplies, until sold. The revenues generated from such
sales or installations shall be recorded in Account 415, Revenues from Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work, and the associated expenses shall be charged to Account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work.
4.
Equipment Purchased for Own Use
If a borrower purchases satellite or cable television equipment for its own use, the investment in the equipment shall be recorded in Account 397, Communication Equipment.

# 624 Pollution Control Bonds
The construction and installation of pollution control facilities are often financed by issuing tax exempt municipal securities. The funds generated from the sale of these securities are deposited into an account that is controlled by a designated trustee. The funds under the control of the trustee are usually invested, earning interest, until they are needed.
Interest expense accrued on the pollution control bonds during the construction period shall be capitalized in Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress. After construction is complete, all subsequent accruals of interest expense shall be charged to Account 427, Interest on Long-Term Debt.
Interest income earned during the construction period shall be recorded as a debit to Account 171, Interest and Dividends Receivable, and a credit to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress. Upon notification of receipt of the interest in the trustee account, Account 221.XX, Long-Term Debt—Pollution Control Bonds, shall be debited and Account 171, Interest and Dividends Receivable shall be credited.

# 625 Prepayment of Debt
Many RUS borrowers have decided to redeem (prepay) their issues of long-term debt. As a result of this redemption, the borrower may incur a gain (discount) or a loss (penalty) on the early extinguishment of debt. The accounting for this gain or loss is highlighted in this section.
If debt is redeemed without refunding (paid with general funds), the gain or loss incurred shall be recorded in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The borrower shall amortize the recorded deferral on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the old debt issue. Amounts so amortized shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
If the debt is redeemed with refunding (refinanced), the gain or loss incurred shall be recorded in Account 189 or Account 257, as appropriate. The borrower may elect to account for the deferrals as follows:
1. Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant;
2. Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remaining life of the old debt issue; or
3. Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new debt issue.
Once an election has been made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. Regardless of the option selected, the amortization shall be charged to either Account 428.1 or 429.1, as appropriate.
Where a regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the borrower specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on the redemption of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to interest charges in computing the borrower's rates, the alternative method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to the redemption of long-term debt with or without refunding. The alternative method requires that gains or losses be recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as incurred. When the alternative method is used, the borrower
shall include a footnote to the financial statements stating the reason for using this method and its treatment for rate making purposes.

# 626 Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program
On December 21, 1987, Section 313, Cushion of Credits Payments Program, was added to the Rural Electrification Act. Section 313 establishes a Rural Economic Development Subaccount and authorizes the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service to provide zero interest loans or grants to RE Act borrowers for the purpose of promoting rural economic development and job creation projects.
Subpart B, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, 7 CFR Part 1703, sets forth the policies and procedures relating to the zero interest loan program and for approving and administering grants. The accounting journal entries required to record the transactions associated with a rural economic development loan are as follows:
Dr. 224.17, RUS Notes Executed—Economic Development—Debit
Cr. 224.16, Long-Term Debt—RUS Economic Development Notes Executed
To record the contractual obligation to RUS for the Economic Development Notes.
Dr. 131.12, Cash—General—Economic Development Funds

# 627 Postretirement Benefits
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a “pay-as-you-go” basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for the benefits.
As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan.
This statement applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual contracts with specified terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement benefit plan under the provisions of this statement.
Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multi-employer plans, and multiple-employer plans.
The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single-and multiple-employer plans. The accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans.
Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining service life of the employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used.

# Accounting Requirements
All RUS borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106; however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. RUS will not allow electric borrowers to account for postretirement benefits on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation does not require RUS approval provided that it complies with the provisions of Statement No. 106. If, however, a borrower elects to expense the transition obligation in the current period and subsequently defer this expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by RUS. In those states in which the commission will not allow the recovery of the transition obligation through future rates, the transition obligation must be expensed, in its entirety, in the year in which Statement No. 106 is adopted. A portion of the transition obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported.

# Effective Date and Implementation
For plans outside the United States and for defined benefit plans of employers that (a) are nonpublic enterprises and (b) sponsor defined benefit postretirement plans with no more than 500 plan participants in the aggregate, Statement No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. For all other plans, Statement No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.
RUS borrowers must comply with the implementation dates set forth in Statement No. 106. At the time of the adoption of Statement No. 106, rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period expense and any amortization of the transition obligation. A copy of a board resolution or commission order, as appropriate, indicating that the transition obligation and current period expense have been included in the borrower's rates must be submitted to RUS.

# Accounting Journal Entries—Transition Obligation
The journal entries required to record the transition obligation are as follows:
1. If the borrower elects to expense the transition obligation in the current period and there is no deferral of costs, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 435.1, Cumulative Effect on Prior Years of a Change in Accounting Principle
or
Dr. 926, Employee Pensions and Benefits
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record the current period recognition of the transition obligation for postretirement benefits. Note: A portion of the transition obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported.
2. If the borrower elects to defer and amortize the transition obligation in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 71, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record the deferral of the transition obligation under the provisions of Statement No. 71.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
To record the amortization of postretirement benefits expenses as they are recovered through rates in accordance with Statement No. 71.
3. The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation under the provisions of Statement No. 106 is considered to be an off balance sheet item. If, therefore, the borrower elects to defer and amortize the transition obligation on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees or 20 years in accordance with Statement No. 106, no entry is required. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement benefit cost as it is amortized. It should be noted, however, that the amount of the unamortized transition obligation must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

# Accounting Journal Entries—Current Period Expense
The current period postretirement expense should be recorded by the following entry:
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record current period postretirement benefit expense.
Dr. 228.3X, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits—Funded
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record cash payments on a “pay-as-you-go” basis for postretirement benefits.

# Accounting Journal Entry—Funding
If a borrower elects to voluntarily fund its postretirement benefits obligation in an external, irrevocable trust, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 228.3X, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits—Funded
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the funding of postretirement benefits expense into an external, irrevocable trust.
If a borrower elects to voluntarily fund its postretirement benefits obligation in an investment vehicle other than an external, irrevocable trust, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 128, Other Special Funds
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the funding of postretirement benefits expense into an investment vehicle other than an external, irrevocable trust.

# 628 Postemployment Benefits
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement No. 112) establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Inactive employees are those who are not currently rendering service to the employer but who have not been terminated, including employees who are on disability leave, regardless of whether they are expected to return to active service. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 112, former members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative.
Postemployment benefits include benefits provided to former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents. They include, but are not limited to, salary continuation, supplemental benefits (including workmen's compensation), health care, job training and counseling, and life insurance coverage. Benefits may be provided in cash or in kind and may be paid upon cessation of active employment or over a specified period of time.
The cost of providing postemployment benefits is considered to be a part of the compensation provided to an employee in exchange for current service and should, therefore, be accrued as the employee earns the right to be paid for future postemployment benefits. Applying the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences, a postemployment benefit obligation is accrued when all of the following conditions are met:
1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed;
2. The obligation relates to employee rights that vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those rights for which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights that accumulate are those earned, but unused rights to compensated absences that may be carried forward to one or more periods subsequent to the period in which they are earned;
3. Payment of the compensation is probable; and
4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
If all of these conditions are not met, the employer must account for its postemployment benefit obligation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (Statement No. 5) when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.
If an obligation for postemployment benefits is not accrued in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 5 or Statement No. 43 only because the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the financial statements should disclose that fact.

# Accounting Requirements
All RUS borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements set forth in Statement No. 112 as of the statement's implementation date. A portion of the cumulative effect may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported. If a borrower elects to defer the cumulative effect of implementing Statement No. 112 in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by RUS.

# Effective Date and Implementation
Statement No. 112 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Previously issued financial statements should not be restated.
RUS borrowers must comply with the implementation date set forth in Statement No. 112. At the time of the adoption of Statement No. 112, rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period expense.

# Accounting Journal Entries
The journal entries required to account for postemployment benefits are as follows:
Dr. 435.1, Cumulative Effect on Prior Years of a Change in Accounting Principle
Dr. 107, Construction Work in Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work in Progress
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record the cumulative effect of implementing Statement No. 112.

# Note:
A portion of the cumulative effect may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported. Account 435.1 is closed to Account 219.2, Nonoperating Margins.
If the borrower elects to defer and amortize the cumulative effect in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 71, the following entry shall be recorded:
Dr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record the deferral of the cumulative effect of implementing Statement No. 112 in
accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 71.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work in Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work in Progress
Cr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
To record the amortization of the cumulative effect of implementing Statement No. 112 as it is recovered through rates in accordance with Statement No. 71.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work in Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work in Progress
Cr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
To record current period postemployment benefit expense.

# Note:
If postemployment benefits are accrued under the criteria set forth in Statement No. 43, this journal entry is made on a monthly basis. If, however, the accrual is based upon the provisions of Statement No. 5, this is a one-time entry unless the liability is reevaluated and subsequently adjusted.

# 629 Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No. 115), establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Statement No. 115 does not apply to investments in equity securities accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in consolidated subsidiaries.
At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed.
Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Debt securities are not classified as held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security only for an indefinite period; for example, if the security would become available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates and related changes in the security's prepayment risk, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and changes in foreign currency risk.
Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities and are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in prices. Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified as either trading securities or held-to-maturity securities.
Statement No. 115 requires unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities to be included in earnings in the current period. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings; however, they are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.
For individual securities classified as either available-for sale or held-to-maturity, an entity must determine whether a decline in the security's fair value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is determined to be permanent, that is, it is probable that the entity will not be able to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the realized loss is accounted for in earnings of the current period. The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the separate component of equity. Subsequent decreases are also included in the separate component of equity.
All trading securities are reported as current assets in the balance sheet and individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities are classified as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate. Cash flows from the purchase, sale, or maturity of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities are classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification.

# Accounting Requirements
All RUS borrowers must adopt the accounting, reporting, and disclosure requirements set forth in Statement No. 115 as of the statement's implementation date. Unrealized holding gains or losses for trading securities shall be recorded in either Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate. Unrealized holding gains or losses for available-for-sale securities held by the corporate entity are recognized as a component of stockholder's equity in Account 215.1, Unrealized Gains and Losses—Debt and Equity Securities. A contra account of the investment account shall be debited or credited accordingly. Unrealized gains and losses for
available-for-sale securities held in a decommissioning fund shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, the reported value of the fund.

# Effective Date and Implementation
Statement No. 115 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. At the beginning of the entity's fiscal year, the entity must classify its debt and equity securities on the basis of the entity's current intent. This statement may not be applied retroactively to prior years' financial statements. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 16, 1993, reporting entities are permitted to apply Statement No. 115 as of the end of a fiscal year for which annual financial statements have not previously been issued.

# 630 Split Dollar Life Insurance
The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Split Dollar Life Insurance provides life insurance benefits to cooperative employees. The benefits provided under this policy consist of two components, the face value of the insurance policy and the accumulated cash surrender value. While the employee is the owner of the policy, the employee must sign a collateral assignment giving the cooperative absolute right to the cash surrender value of the policy. Under the terms of this collateral assignment, the employee must reimburse the cooperative for the premiums paid upon the employee's termination of employment or attainment of the age of 62 if the employee wishes to maintain the insurance coverage. If death occurs prior to either of these events, the premiums paid to date by the cooperative are deducted from the death benefits payable to the policy beneficiary.

# Accounting Requirements
Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85-4, Accounting for Purchase of Life Insurance (Bulletin 85-4), states that the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract as of the date of the financial statements should be reported as an asset. The change in the cash surrender or contract value of that asset during the period should be reported as an adjustment to the premiums paid in determining the expense or income to be recognized for the period. The cooperative shall, therefore, record the cash surrender value of the policy as an asset because of its absolute right to receive that value based upon the employee's collateral assignment. Any receivable that may occur as a result of the employee reimbursement for the premiums paid is contingent upon the employee electing to maintain the insurance coverage after termination of employment or reaching the age of 62 and is not recorded as an asset on the cooperative's records.

# Accounting Journal Entries
The journal entries required to account for the NRECA Split Dollar Life Insurance Program are as follows:
Dr. 124, Other Investments
Cr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
To record an increase in the cash surrender value of the insurance contract.
or
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Cr. 124, Other Investments
To record a decrease in the cash surrender value of the insurance contract.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
To record the premium cost of the insurance contract.

# 631 Special Early Retirement Plan
The Special Early Retirement Plan (SERP) being offered through the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) constitutes an amendment to its Retirement and Security (R
S) program. The SERP is often chosen as a vehicle through which the cooperative may reduce the size of its workforce or replace more highly paid employees with lower paid entry level employees. If an employee covered by an NRECA retirement plan chose to retire before his/her normal retirement date, that employee would receive an actuarially reduced benefit. However, when a cooperative elects to offer a SERP, no such reduction is required. The cooperative selects the criteria under which an employee will be eligible to participate such as age, years of service, or a combination of age and benefit service requirements. As with other amendments to the R
S program, NRECA calculates the cost of the plan based upon the criteria selected by the cooperative and allows the cooperative to pay the cost immediately or on an installment basis.
Under this plan, the employee receives full retirement benefits in the form of either an immediate lump-sum settlement or annuity payments. It is not unusual for the cooperative to add an incentive to encourage participation such as medical or life insurance, either in whole or in part, until age 65. The actuarial analysis provided by NRECA includes the cost of the SERP and the estimated reduction and/or increase in costs associated with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (Statement No. 106).

# Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employer's Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87)
In accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 87, the costs associated with an amendment to a multiemployer plan are recognized when they become due and payable. Since NRECA calculates the amount due and payable at the time of the amendment, the entire amount due, whether paid immediately or financed through NRECA or any other institution, must be recognized as an expense at that time. This cost may, however, be deferred in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71).

# Accounting Journal Entries
The journal entry required to record the additional pension costs associated with the SERP is as follows:
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
or
Cr. 224, Other Long-Term Debt
To record the prior service pension costs incurred as a result of adopting the SERP.
If the borrower elects to defer and amortize the cost in accordance with Statement No. 71, the following entries shall be recorded:
Dr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
or
Cr. 224, Other Long-Term Debt
To record, under the provisions of Statement No. 71, the deferral of the prior service pension costs incurred as a result of adopting the SERP.
Dr. Various Operations, Maintenance, and Administrative Expense Accounts
Dr. 107, Construction Work-in-Progress
Dr. 108.8, Retirement Work-in-Progress
Cr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
To record the amortization of deferred prior service pension costs as they are recovered through rates in accordance with Statement No. 71.

# Statement No. 106
In the event that net reductions in postretirement benefits result from this plan amendment, the reductions are recognized as follows:
1. The amount of the reduction shall first reduce any existing unrecognized prior service cost;
2. Any remaining reductions shall next reduce any unrecognized transition obligation; and
3. Any remaining reduction shall be recognized in a manner consistent with the accounting for prior service postretirement benefit costs.
In accordance with Statement No. 106, prior service postretirement benefit costs are recognized in equal amounts in each remaining year of service for active plan participants. Because it is an off-balance sheet item, only a memorandum entry is required to reduce the amount of unrecognized prior service cost.
At adoption, Statement No. 106 permitted the recognition of the transition obligation in one of two ways. The transition obligation was recognized over the longer of the average remaining service period of current plan participants or 20 years, or it may have been recognized immediately. If the delayed recognition option was chosen under Statement No. 106, this, too, was an off-balance sheet item that requires only a memorandum entry to reduce the amount of unrecognized transition obligation. However, if the immediate recognition option was chosen, the cooperative either recorded the expense in that year or, with RUS approval, deferred the expense under the provisions of Statement No. 71. If the expense were recorded, in total, in the year of adoption, no unrecognized transition obligation remains to reduce. If, however, the transition obligation was deferred in accordance with Statement No. 71, the journal entry required to effect the reduction in Statement No. 106 expense is as follows:
Dr. 228.3, Accumulated Provision for Pensions and Benefits
Cr. 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets
To record a reduction in the deferred Statement No. 106 transition obligation resulting from the adoption of the SERP.

# Note:
The dollar value of this entry must not exceed the deferral shown on the balance sheet.
If, after the two previous reductions have been made, any net credit remains, it shall be recognized in a manner consistent with prior service costs; that is, as an off balance sheet item that is amortized over the remaining service lives (to full eligibility) of the active plan participants. The annual amortization reduces amounts normally charged to the various operations, maintenance, and administrative expense accounts and Account 228.3 as postretirement benefit expenses.

# 633 Cushion of Credit
On December 21, 1987, Section 313, Cushion of Credits Payments Program, was added to the Rural Electrification Act. Cushion of
credit regulations are located in The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 7 CFR part 1785. A cushion of credit payment is a voluntary unscheduled payment by a borrower in excess of amounts due and payable. A cushion of credit account is automatically established by Rural Development for each borrower who makes a payment after October 1, 1987, in excess of amounts then due on a Rural Development note. Payments received in the month in which an installment is due will be applied to the installment due. However, if the regular installment payment is received at a later date in the month, the first payment received will be applied retroactively to the cushion of credit account and the second will be applied to the installment due. By law, cushion of credit accounts earn five per cent interest annually, accrued daily and posted quarterly. Although the interest earned will appear as a reduction in the interest billed on the borrower's Rural Development notes and will be separately shown on Form 694, Statement of Interest and Principal Due, interest billed must be adjusted by adding back the interest earned while principal is reduced by the amount of the interest earned before recording the debt payment. Below is an example of the adjustment required:
As billed
Adjustment

$1,000
$1,000
Principal
800
−$50
750
Interest
* 200
50
250
* Includes reduction of $50 for interest earned on cushion of credit account.
Cushion of credit is intended to enable the borrower to deposit funds and have those funds available to make scheduled payments (or installments) only. A borrower may not have more cushion of credit funds, including accrued interest, than their entire Rural Development debt which includes loans made in Rural Electric and Telephone (RET) and Federal Financing Bank (FFB). If a borrower makes less than or no payment when their billing invoice is due, cushion of credit will automatically add to or make their payment systematically for them.
Cushion of credit is not available to use for prepayment of loan accounts before maturity except for the following situations:
1. The total amount of cushion of credit principal with accrued interest equals the borrower's total debt
2. The borrower intends to prepay all remaining debt using a combination of payment with all cushion of credit funds available.

# Accounting Requirements
All payments made to a cushion of credit account should be recorded as follows:
Dr. 224.6, Advance Payments Unapplied—Long-Term Debt—Debit
Cr. 131.1, Cash—General
All interest earned on the balance of funds in the account should be recorded as follows:
Dr. 224.6, Advance Payments Unapplied—Long-Term Debt—Debit
Cr. 419, Interest and Dividend Income

# Reporting Requirements
Previously, Rural Development required that the balance in the cushion of credit account be reported, on the Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, as a reduction of the Rural Development long-term debt balance. On January 15, 2003, Rural Development issued letter guidance permitting a proportionate share of the cushion of credit balance be reported as a reduction in Current Maturities Long-Term Debt. Additionally, beginning with calendar year 2006 submissions, Form 7 has been revised to include a separate line for cushion of credit balances within the long-term debt section of Part C.
For purposes of the audited financial statements, presentation of the balance of the cushion of credit account as a long-term investment is an acceptable alternative to Rural Development.

73 FR 30290, May 27, 2008, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1767.66
Purpose.
This subpart establishes policies and procedures for the effective preservation and efficient maintenance of financial records of Electric borrowers.
§ 1767.67
General.
(a) Rural Development endorses the guidelines as described by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) “Regulations to Govern the Preservation of Records of Public Utilities and Licensees.” The FERC guidelines can be found in 18 CFR part 125.
(b) The regulations prescribed in this part apply to all books of account, contracts, records, memoranda, documents, papers, and correspondence prepared by or on behalf of the borrower as well as those which come into its possession in connection with the acquisition of property by purchase, consolidation, merger, etc.
(c) The regulations prescribed in this part shall not be construed as excusing compliance with any other lawful requirements for the preservation of records.
§ 1767.68
Designation of a supervisory official.
Each borrower shall designate one or more officials to supervise the preservation of its records.
§ 1767.69
Index of records.
(a) Each borrower shall maintain a master index of records. The master index shall identify the records retained, the related retention period, and the locations where the records are maintained. The master index shall be subject to review by Rural Development and Rural Development shall reserve the right to add records, or lengthen retention periods upon finding that retention periods may be insufficient for its purposes.
(b) At each office where records are kept or stored the borrower shall arrange, file, and index the records currently at that site so that they may be readily identified and made available to representatives of Rural Development.
§ 1767.70
Record storage media.
The media used to capture and store the data will play an important part of each Rural Development borrower. Each borrower has the flexibility to select its own storage media. The following are required:
(a) The storage media shall have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable retention period provided for in the master index of records, unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data. Each transfer of data from one media to another shall be verified for accuracy and documented.
(b) Each borrower shall implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of, and ready access to, data stored on machine-readable media. The borrower's internal control procedures shall be documented by a responsible supervisory official.
(c) Records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner that they are easily accessible.
(d) The borrower shall have the hardware and software available to locate, identify, and reproduce the records in readable form without loss of clarity.
(e) At the expiration of the retention period, the borrower may use any appropriate method to destroy records.
(f) When any records are lost or destroyed before the expiration of the retention period set forth in the master index, a certified statement shall be added to the master index listing, as far as may be determined, the records lost or destroyed and describing the circumstances of the premature loss or destruction.
§ 1767.71
Periods of retention.
(a) Records of Rural Development borrowers of a kind not listed in the FERC regulations should be governed by those applicable to the closest similar records. Financial requirement and expenditure statements, which are not specifically covered by FERC regulations, are recommended to be kept for one year after the “as of date” of Rural Development's loan fund and accounting review.
(b) Consumer accounts' records should be kept for those years for which patronage capital has not been allocated.
(c) Records supporting construction financed by Rural Development shall be retained until audited and approved by Rural Development.
(d) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from utility service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are
retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by Rural Development or other regulatory body having jurisdiction.
(e) Life and mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired, whichever is longer.

§ 1770.4
Record storage media.
Each RUS borrower has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions:

# 101 Postretirement Benefits
A. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a “pay-as-you-go” basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for the benefits. (Statement 106 is available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, CT. 06856-5116.)
B. As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan.
C. Statement No. 106 applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual contracts with specific terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement benefit plan under the provisions of this statement.
D. Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multiemployer plans, and multiple-employer plans.
E. A single-employer plan is a postretirement benefit plan that is maintained by one employer. The term may also be applied to a plan that is maintained by related parties such as a parent and its subsidiaries. A multiemployer plan is a postretirement benefit plan in which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective-bargaining agreements. One characteristic of a multiemployer plan is that the assets contributed by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer.
F. A multiple-employer plan is a postretirement benefit plan that is maintained by more than one employer but is not a multiemployer plan. A multiple-employer plan is generally not collectively bargained and is intended to allow participating employers to pool their plan assets for investment purposes and reduce the cost of plan administration. A multiple-employer plan maintains separate accounts for each employer so that contributions provide benefits only for employees of the contributing employer.
G. The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single- and multiple-employer plans. The accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans.
H. Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining service period of the active employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used.

# I. Accounting Requirements
A. All borrowers shall adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements as set forth in Statement No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106; however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. Borrowers may not account for postretirement benefits on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
B. Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, an entity may recognize the transition obligation, in its entirety, when Statement No. 106 is first adopted or the entity may elect to delay the recognition of the transition obligation. On December 26, 1991, however, the FCC issued 6 FCC Rcd 7560, which requires telecommunications carriers to recognize the transition obligation on a delayed basis. RUS reviewed this issuance and has determined that borrowers must comply with this ruling and recognize the transition obligation on a delayed basis.
C. The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation on a delayed basis is considered to be an off balance sheet item. As a result, an accounting entry is not required at the time of adoption of Statement No. 106. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement benefit cost as it is amortized. The amount of the unamortized transition obligation must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
D. In accordance with the provisions of Responsible Accounting Officer (RAO) Letter 20, released by the FCC on April 24, 1992, Account 4310, Other Long-Term Liabilities, shall be used to record the liability accrued for postretirement benefits. (RAO Letter 20 is available from the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554.) Borrowers shall credit this account for the net periodic cost of postretirement benefits for the current year and shall debit this account for any fund payments made during the current year.
E. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes current period service cost, interest cost, return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost, gains and losses, and amortization of the transition obligation. If fund payments create a debit balance in the postretirement benefits portion of Account 4310, the debit balance applicable to postretirement benefits shall be reported in Account 1410, Other Noncurrent Assets. Account 1410 shall also be used to record any prepaid postretirement benefit cost.
F. The benefits portion of the expense matrix for the appropriate Part 32 expense accounts shall be used to record the current period service cost component of the current year's net periodic postretirement benefit cost.

# 105 Satellite and Cable Television Services
A. Many RUS borrowers have become involved in providing either satellite or cable television services to their members and others through subsidiaries, joint ventures, or as segments of their current operations.

# Accounting Requirements
A. This section outlines the accounting to be followed when recording transactions involving satellite or cable television services.
1. Separate Subsidiary. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services through a separate subsidiary, the investment in the subsidiary shall be debited to Account 1401, Investments in Affiliated Companies. The net income or loss of the subsidiary shall be debited or credited to Account 1401, as appropriate, with an offsetting entry to Account 7360, Other Nonoperating Income.
2.
Joint Venture.
i. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services through a joint venture, the borrower's ownership interest dictates the accounting methodology. If the borrower has less than a 20 percent ownership interest in the joint venture, the investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting in Account 1402, Investments in Nonaffiliated Companies. Under the cost method, the joint venture's net income or loss is not recorded in the borrower's records. Income is recognized only to the extent of any dividends declared by the joint venture. When a dividend is declared, the borrower shall debit Account 1210, Interest and Dividends Receivable, and credit Account 7310, Dividend Income. When the dividend is received in cash, the borrower shall debit Account 1130.1, Cash—General Fund, and credit Account 1210.
ii. If a borrower has a 20-percent or more ownership interest in the joint venture, the investment is accounted for under the equity method in Account 1401, Investments in Affiliated Companies. The borrower's proportionate share of the joint venture's net income or loss shall be debited or credited to Account 1401, as appropriate, with an offsetting entry to Account 7360, Other Nonoperating Income.
3.
Segment of Current Operations.
i. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television service as a segment of its current operations and there are no shared assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the investment shall be debited to Account 1406.1, Nonregulated Investments—Permanent Investment. The net income or loss from providing such service shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, to Account 1406.3, Nonregulated Investments—Current Net Income, with an offsetting entry to Account 7990, Nonregulated Net Income.
ii. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television service as a segment of current operations and shares assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the franchise and application fees shall be debited to a subaccount of Account 2690, Intangibles. The cost of the satellite or cable television equipment shall be debited to a subaccount of Account 2231, Radio Systems. Revenues earned from providing satellite or cable service shall be credited to Account 5280, Nonregulated Operating Revenue, while the associated expenses shall be recorded in a subaccount of the applicable regulated expense accounts.
4.
Sale and Installation of Satellite or Cable Television Equipment.
i. If a borrower sells or installs satellite or cable television equipment as a segment of its current operations and there are no shared assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the purchase of the equipment shall be debited to Account 1406.1, Nonregulated Investments—Permanent Investment. The net income or loss from providing such services shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, to Account 1406.3, Nonregulated Investments—Current Net Income, with an offsetting entry to Account 7990, Nonregulated Net Income.
ii. If a borrower sells or installs satellite or cable television equipment as a segment of its current operations and shares assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the purchase of the equipment shall be debited to Account 1220.2, Property Held for Sale or Lease. Revenues received for the sale or installation of the equipment shall be credited to Account 5280, Nonregulated Operating Revenue, while the associated expenses shall be debited to a subaccount of the applicable regulated expense accounts.

# 106 Consolidated Financial Statements
A. In October 1987, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (Statement No. 94). (Statement 94 is available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, CT 06856-5116.) For purposes of reporting to RUS, Statement No. 94 shall be applied as follows:
1. A borrower that is a subsidiary of another entity shall prepare and submit to RUS separate financial statements even though this financial information is presented in the parent's consolidated statements.
2. In those cases in which a borrower has a majority-ownership in a subsidiary, the borrower shall prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 94. These consolidated statements must also include supplementary schedules presenting a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for each majority-owned subsidiary included in the consolidated statements.
B. Although Statement No. 94 requires the consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries, the RUS Form 479, Financial and Statistical Report for Telecommunications Borrowers, shall be prepared on an unconsolidated basis by all borrowers.

# 107 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
A. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, established the standards for capitalizing interest cost as a part of the historical cost of acquiring certain assets. In order to capitalize interest, the asset must require a period of time to complete or to get it ready for its intended use. This standard applies to all entities that construct facilities for their own use and should be applied by RUS Telecommunications borrowers as follows:
1. Only actual interest costs incurred on external borrowings qualify to be capitalized. The interest rate used to calculate the amount of interest to be capitalized is based on the companies external borrowings. If a construction project is associated with specific debt, the interest rate on that debt is used to calculate interest cost to be capitalized. If the project is not associated with a specific debt, a weighted average of the rates of all existing debt shall be applied to expenditures for the project. There is no materiality threshold for adoption of this standard (47 CFR 32.26).
2. If a borrower is involved in a joint construction project, all determinations as to the amount of interest incurred and qualified for capitalization must be based on individual financing arrangements with regard to the Interest During Construction rules.
3. The capitalization period shall end when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

# Disclosures
A. The following information with respect to interest cost shall be disclosed in the financial statements or related notes:
1. For an accounting period in which no interest cost is capitalized, the amount of interest cost incurred and charged to expense during the period.
2. For an accounting period in which some interest cost is capitalized, the total amount of interest cost incurred during the period and the amount thereof that has been capitalized.

# 108 Reporting Comprehensive Income
A. In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires that all items that meet the definition of the components of comprehensive income be reported in the financial statements for the period in which they are recognized. Statement 130 establishes a distinction between
comprehensive income
and
other comprehensive income.
1.
Comprehensive income
is composed of net income and
other comprehensive income.
The net income is the result of operations resulting from the aggregation of revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are not items that comprise other comprehensive income.
2.
Other comprehensive income
is composed of the following:
(a) Foreign currency items,
(b) Minimum pension liability adjustments, and
(c) Unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. Gains or losses on investment securities included in the net income of the current period that also had been included in other comprehensive income as unrealized holding gains or losses in a prior period must be adjusted (called reclassification adjustments) in the presentation of other comprehensive income in the current period.
B.
Comprehensive income
expressed as a formula would be:
Net Income ±items of
other comprehensive income
=
comprehensive income
While Statement 130 requires that comprehensive income should be divided into two broad display classifications, net income and other comprehensive income, it does not prescribe a specific format for displaying comprehensive income in the financial statements.
C. RUS Telecommunications borrowers that present a single Statement of Operations and Patronage Capital should present the components of
other comprehensive income
below the total for net income and then present the reconciliation of patronage capital (Retained Earnings). Borrowers that present a separate Statement of Patronage Capital (or Retained Earnings) should display the beginning balance of patronage capital (or retained earnings), net income for the period, other items of comprehensive income and total comprehensive income before the presentation of other items of patronage capital (or retained earnings) for the period.

# 109 Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
A. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, issued in February 1998, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. This statement revises employers' disclosure requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. The statement also permits reduced disclosures for nonpublic entities, which are defined as any entity other than one:
1. Whose debt or equity securities trade in a public market either on a domestic or foreign stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, including securities quoted only locally or regionally,
2. That makes a filing with a regulatory agency in preparation for the sale of any class of debt or equity securities in a public market, or
3. That is controlled by an entity covered by 1 or 2 above.

8. The effect of a one-percentage-point increase and the effect of a one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates on (for purposes of this disclosure, all other assumptions shall be held constant, and the effects shall be measured based on the substantive plan that is the basis for the accounting):

1. The benefit obligation.
2. Fair value of plan assets.

4. Employer contributions.
5. Participant contributions.
6. Benefits paid.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1773.1
General.
(a) This part implements the standards for audits required by the loan contracts and grant agreements of Rural Utilities Service (RUS) electric and telecommunications awardees. The provisions in this part require auditees to prepare and furnish to RUS, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, audited by an independent auditor that meets the requirements of § 1773.5, and performed in accordance with auditing standards issued by generally accepted Government auditing standards (GAGAS) and the requirements of § 1773.7.
(b) This part is based on the requirements of GAGAS in effect at the time of the audit and applicable RUS regulations and subpart F (Audit Requirements) of 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) (2 CFR 200.500-200.521).
(c) This part further sets forth the criteria that an auditee should use to select an auditor and certain audit procedures and audit documentation that must be performed and prepared by the auditor.
(d) Failure of an auditee to provide audited financial statements in compliance with this part is a serious violation of the RUS security agreement. RUS relies on audited financial statements in order to assess and monitor the financial condition of its awardees and to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities.
(e) RUS reserves the right to suspend its acceptance of audits performed by auditors who, in the opinion of RUS, are not meeting the requirements of this part or with unresolved disputes or issues until such time that the matter can be resolved to RUS' satisfaction.

# Subpart B—RUS Audit Requirements
§ 1773.3
Annual audit.
(a) Each auditee must have its financial statements audited annually by an auditor selected by the auditee and approved by RUS as set forth in § 1773.4. All auditees, except those subject to the Single Audit Act, must submit audited financial statements on a comparative basis covering at least two consecutive 12-month periods, unless the entity has not been in existence for two consecutive 12-month audit periods. Financial statements should be prepared in accordance with GAAP, or if prepared using a special purpose framework, reconciling schedules should be included. Audits of consolidated financial statements of the parent are not an acceptable replacement for an audit of the auditee.
(b) Each auditee must establish an annual audit date within 12 months of the date of the first advance and must prepare annual financial statements for the audit date established. Each auditee must notify RUS of the audit
date at least 90 days prior to the selected audit date.
(c) Auditees not subject to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must furnish a reporting package to RUS within 120 days of the audit date. (See § 1773.21) Until all loans made or guaranteed by RUS are repaid and unliquidated obligations rescinded, auditees must continue to provide annual audited financial statements. Auditees with grant funding only must furnish annual audited financial statements in the year of the first advance and until all funds have been advanced or rescinded, and all financial compliance requirements have been fully satisfied.
(d) An auditee that is identified as a non-Federal entity as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, which means a State, local government, Indian tribe, Institution of Higher Education (IHE), or nonprofit organization that carries out a Federal award as a recipient or subrecipient, must meet the audit requirements outlined in 2 CFR 200.501 and 200.502 and the Single Audit Act, and not this part.
(1) For auditees expending less than the threshold for expenditure in Federal awards during the year, RUS reserves its right under 2 CFR 200.503(b) and (c) to arrange for an audit performed in accordance with this part.
(2) Within 30 days after the audit date, auditees subject to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must notify RUS, in writing via email, of the total Federal awards expended during the year and must state whether the audit will be performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act or this part.
(e) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 does not apply to audits of RUS electric and telecommunications cooperatives and for-profit telecommunications awardees unless the awardee has contractually agreed with another Federal agency (
e.g.,
Federal Emergency Management Agency) to provide a financial audit performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. In no circumstance will an auditee be required to submit separate audits performed in accordance with this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
[88 FR 7563, Feb. 6, 2023, as amended at 89 FR 88634, Nov. 8, 2024]
§ 1773.4
Auditee's responsibilities.
(a)
Selection of a qualified auditor.
The auditee's governance board is responsible for the selection of a qualified auditor that meets the requirements set forth in § 1773.5. When selecting an auditor, the auditee should consider, among other matters:
(1) The qualifications of auditors available to do the work;
(2) The auditor's experience in performing audits of utilities, related industries, or in the case of grantees, experience in auditing entities comparable to the grantee; and
(3) The auditor's ability to complete the audit and submit the reporting package to the auditee within 90 days of the audit date.
(b)
Board approval of selection.
The board's approval of an auditor must be recorded by a board resolution that states:
(1) The auditor represents that it meets RUS qualifications to perform an audit; and
(2) The auditee and auditor will enter into an audit engagement in accordance with § 1773.6.
(c)
Notification of selection.
When the initial selection or subsequent change of an auditor has been made, the auditee must notify RUS, in writing via email, at least 90 days prior to the audit date. Changes in the name of an auditor are considered to be a change in the auditor.
(1) Within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice, RUS or its designated representative will notify the auditee, in writing via email, if the selection or change in auditor is not satisfactory based on criteria described in § 1773.5.
(2) Notification that the same auditor has been selected for succeeding audits of the auditee's financial statements is not required; however, the procedures outlined in this part must be followed for each new auditor selected, even though such auditor may previously have been approved by RUS to audit records of other RUS auditees.
(d)
Audit engagement letter.
The auditee must enter into an audit agreement with the auditor that complies with § 1773.6 prior to the initiation of the audit.
(e)
Debarment certification.
The auditee must obtain, from the selected auditor, a lower tier covered transaction certification or other method in accordance with 2 CFR 180.300 or 2 CFR part 417, as required by Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 and any rules or regulations in this chapter issued thereunder.
(f)
Peer review report.
The auditee must obtain, from the selected auditor, a copy of the auditor's most recently accepted peer review report, which should be dated within 36 months of the engagement letter.
(g)
Preparation of schedules.
The auditee must prepare any schedules that are required by the auditor to perform the audit, including a complete set of financial statements, a schedule of deferred debits and deferred credits and a detailed schedule of investments in subsidiary and affiliated companies accounted for on the cost, equity, or consolidated basis. The detailed schedule of investments can be included in the notes to the financial statements or as a separate schedule as long as all information required is adequately disclosed. If the auditee uses a method other than GAAP, reconciliation schedules should be included with the reporting package.
(1) The schedule of deferred debits and deferred credits must include a description of the deferral and a notation as to whether the deferral has received written approval from RUS. If a determination is made that prior written approval is not required, cite the specific authority for the deferral.
(2) The schedule of investments must include investments in subsidiary and affiliated companies, corporations, limited liability corporations and partnerships, joint ventures, etc. accounted for on either the cost, equity or on a consolidated basis. For all investments, the auditee must list the name of the entity, ownership percentage, and the principal business in which the entity is engaged. For investments recorded on the cost basis, the auditee must include the original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years and the net investment. For investments recorded on the equity or consolidated basis, the auditee must include the ownership percentage, original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years, and current and prior years' earnings and losses, including accumulated losses in excess of the original investment.
(h)
Scope limitations.
The auditee will not limit the scope of the audit to the extent that the auditor is unable to provide an unmodified opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP due to the scope limitation.
(i)
Submission of reporting package.
The auditee must submit to RUS, via the Agency designated system, the required reporting package as set forth in § 1773.21.
(1) A reporting package that fails to meet the requirements detailed in this part will be returned to the auditee via email with a written explanation of noncompliance.
(2) The auditee must, within 30 days of the date of the email detailing the noncompliance, submit a corrected reporting package to RUS via the Agency designated system.
(3) If a corrected reporting package is not received within 30 days of the date of the email detailing the noncompliance, RUS will take appropriate action, depending on the severity of the noncompliance. Per § 1773.1(d), failure to provide an audit in compliance with this part is a serious violation of the RUS security agreement. RUS relies on audited financial statements to assess and monitor the financial condition of its awardees and to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities.
(j)
Submission of a plan of corrective action.
If the auditor's report contains findings and recommendations but does not include the auditee's response, the auditee must submit written responses via email to RUS within 180 days of the audit date. The written responses must address:
(1) The corrective action already taken or planned, or the reason the auditee believes no action is necessary; and
(2) The status of corrective action taken on previously reported findings and recommendations.

(3) That the auditor acknowledges the mandatory reporting requirements for fraud, illegal acts, or noncompliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements in § 1773.9. Acceptance of the engagement letter by the auditee is required, thus granting the auditor permission to directly notify the appropriate officials which may include but is not limited to the governance board, RUS, and OIG;
(4) That the auditor acknowledges that it is required under § 1773.7 to contact RUS if the auditor is unable to resolve scope limitations imposed by the auditee, or if such limitations in scope violate this part.

(5) That the auditee and auditor acknowledge that RUS will consider the auditee to be in violation of its RUS Security Agreement and this part if the auditee fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with GAGAS and this part;
(6) That the auditor represents that it meets the requirements under this part to perform the audit;
(7) That the auditor will perform the audit and will issue the required reports and the auditee will prepare and submit the reporting package in accordance with the requirements of this part;
(8) That the auditor will document the audit work performed in accordance with GAGAS, and the requirements of this part; and

(1) As noted under § 1773.4(h), the auditee will not limit the scope of the audit to the extent that the auditor is unable to meet RUS audit requirements without prior written approval of RUS.
(2) If the auditor determines during the audit that an unmodified opinion cannot be issued due to a scope limitation imposed by the auditee, the auditor should use professional judgment to determine what levels of the auditee's management and/or those charged with governance should be informed.
(3) After informing the auditee's management and/or those charged with governance, if the scope limitation is not adequately resolved, the auditor should immediately contact RUS.
[88 FR 7564, Feb. 6, 2023]
§ 1773.8
Audit date.
The annual audit must be performed as of the end of the same calendar month each year unless prior approval to change the audit date is obtained, in writing via email, from RUS or its designated representative.

The auditor must also plan the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting material misstatements resulting from violations of provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements.
(b) If specific information comes to the auditor's attention that provides evidence concerning the existence of possible violations of provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements that could have a material indirect effect on the financial statements, the auditor should apply audit procedures specifically directed to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence regarding those possible violations of provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements.
(c) Pursuant to the terms of its audit engagement letter with the auditee, the auditor must, as soon as practical, report through the methods indicated below, all instances of fraud, illegal acts, and all indications or instances of noncompliance with laws, whether material or not, to:
