# General Provisions
§ 467.01
Applicability.
(a) Aluminum forming includes commonly recognized forming operations such as rolling, drawing, extruding, and forging and related operations such as heat treatment, casting, and surface treatments. Surface treatment of aluminum is any chemical or electrochemical treatment applied to the surface of aluminum. Such surface treatment is considered to be a part of aluminum forming whenever it is performed as an integral part of aluminum forming. For the purposes of this regulation, surface treatment of aluminum is considered to be an integral part of aluminum forming whenever it is performed at the same plant site at which aluminum is formed and such operations are not considered for regulation under the Electroplating and Metal Finishing provisions of 40 CFR parts 413 and 433. Casting aluminum when performed as an integral part of aluminum forming and located on-site at an aluminum forming plant is considered an aluminum forming operation and is covered under these guidelines. When aluminum forming is performed on the same site as primary aluminum reduction the casting shall be regulated by the nonferrous metals guidelines if there is no cooling of the aluminum prior to casting. If the aluminum is cooled prior to casting then the casting shall be regulated by the aluminum forming guidelines.
(b) This part applies to any aluminum forming facility, except for plants identified under paragraph (c) of this section, which discharges or may discharge pollutants to waters of the United States or which introduces or may introduce pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works.
(c) This part is applicable to indirect discharging aluminum forming plants that extrude less than 3 million pounds of product per year and draw, with emulsions or soaps, less than 1 million pounds per year.

# Note:
This paragraph is promulgated as an Interim Final Rule.
[48 FR 49149, Oct. 24, 1983; 49 FR 11631, Mar. 27, 1984]
§ 467.02
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a)
Aluminum forming
is a set of manufacturing operations in which aluminum and aluminum alloys are made into semifinished products by hot or cold working.
(b)
Ancillary operation
is a manufacturing operation that has a large flow, discharges significant amounts of pollutants, and may not be present at every plant in a subcategory, but when present is an integral part of the aluminum forming process.
(c)
Contact cooling water
is any wastewater which contacts the aluminum workpiece or the raw materials used in forming aluminum.
(d)
Continuous casting
is the production of sheet, rod, or other long shapes by solidifying the metal while it is being poured through an open-ended mold using little or no contact cooling water. Continuous casting of rod and sheet generates spent lubricants and rod casting also generates contact cooling water.
(e)
Degassing
is the removal of dissolved hydrogen from the molten aluminum prior to casting. Chemicals are added and gases are bubbled through the molten aluminum. Sometimes a wet scrubber is used to remove excess chlorine gas.
(f)
Direct chill casting
is the pouring of molten aluminum into a water-cooled mold. Contact cooling water is sprayed onto the aluminum as it is dropped into the mold, and the aluminum ingot falls into a water bath at the end of the casting process.
(g)
Drawing
is the process of pulling metal through a die or succession of dies to reduce the metal's diameter or alter its shape. There are two aluminum forming subcategories based on the drawing process. In the drawing with neat oils subcategory, the drawing process uses a pure or neat oil as a
lubricant. In the drawing with emulsions or soaps subcategory, the drawing process uses an emulsion or soap solution as a lubricant.
(h)
Emulsions
are stable dispersions of two immiscible liquids. In the aluminum forming category this is usually an oil and water mixture.
(i)
Cleaning or etching
is a chemical solution bath and a rinse or series of rinses designed to produce a desired surface finish on the workpiece. This term includes air pollution control scrubbers which are sometimes used to control fumes from chemical solution baths. Conversion coating and anodizing when performed as an integral part of the aluminum forming operations are considered cleaning or etching operations. When conversion coating or anodizing are covered here they are not subject to regulation under the provisions of 40 CFR part 433, Metal Finishing.
(j)
Extrusion
is the application of pressure to a billet of aluminum, forcing the aluminum to flow through a die orifice. The extrusion subcategory is based on the extrusion process.
(k)
Forging
is the exertion of pressure on dies or rolls surrounding heated aluminum stock, forcing the stock to change shape and in the case where dies are used to take the shape of the die. The forging subcategory is based on the forging process.
(l)
Heat treatment
is the application of heat of specified temperature and duration to change the physical properties of the metal.
(m) Hot water seal is a heated water bath (heated to approximately 180 °F) used to seal the surface coating on formed aluminum which has been anodized and coated. In establishing an effluent allowance for this operation, the hot water seal shall be classified as a cleaning or etching rinse.
(n)
In-process control technology
is the conservation of chemicals and water throughout the production operations to reduce the amount of wastewater to be discharged.
(o)
Neat oil
is a pure oil with no or few impurities added. In aluminum forming its use is mostly as a lubricant.
(p)
Rolling
is the reduction in thickness or diameter of a workpiece by passing it between lubricated steel rollers. There are two subcategories based on the rolling process. In the rolling with neat oils subcategory, pure or neat oils are used as lubricants for the rolling process. In the rolling with emulsions subcategory, emulsions are used as lubricants for the rolling process.
(q) The term
Total Toxic Organics (TTO)
shall mean the sum of the masses or concentrations of each of the following toxic organic compounds which is found in the discharge at a concentration greater than 0.010 mg/1:
p-chloro-m-cresol
2-chlorophenol
2,4-dinitrotoluene

(r)
Stationary casting
is the pouring of molten aluminum into molds and allowing the metal to air cool.
(s)
Wet scrubbers
are air pollution control devices used to remove particulates and fumes from air by entraining the pollutants in a water spray.
(t)
BPT
means the best practicable control technology currently available under section 304(b)(1) of the Act.
(u)
BAT
means the best available technology economically achievable under section 304(b)(2)(B) of the Act.
(v)
BCT
means the best conventional pollutant control technology, under section 304(b)(4) of the Act.
(w)
NSPS
means new source performance standards under section 306 of the Act.
(x)
PSES
means pretreatment standards for existing sources, under section 307(b) of the Act.
(y)
PSNS
means pretreatment standards for new sources, under section 307(c) of the Act.
(z) The production normalizing mass (/kkg) for each core or ancillary operation is the mass (off-kkg or off-lb) processed through that operation.

§ 467.03
Monitoring and reporting requirements.
The following special monitoring and reporting requirements apply to all facilities controlled by this regulation.
(a) Periodic analyses for cyanide as may be required under part 122 or 403 of this chapter are not required when both of the following conditions are met:
(1) The first wastewater sample of each calendar year has been analyzed and found to contain less than 0.07 mg/l cyanide.
(2) The owner or operator of the aluminum forming plant certifies in writing to the POTW authority or permit issuing authority that cyanide is not and will not be used in the aluminum forming process.
(b) As an alternative monitoring procedure for pretreatment, the POTW user may measure and limit oil and grease to the levels shown in pretreatment standards in lieu of measuring and regulating total toxic organics (TTO).
(c) The “monthly average” regulatory values shall be the basis for the monthly average discharge limits in direct discharge permits and for pretreatment standards. Compliance with the monthly discharge limit is required regardless of the number of samples analyzed and averaged.
(Information collection requirements in paragraph (a) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2040-0033)

# Subpart C—Extrusion Subcategory
§ 467.30
Applicability; description of the extrusion subcategory.
This subpart applies to discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States and introductions of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works from the core and the ancillary operations of the extrusion subcategory.
§ 467.31
Specialized definitions.
For the purpose of this subpart:
(a) The “core” of the extrusion subcategory shall include extrusion die cleaning, dummy block cooling, stationary casting, artificial aging, annealing, degreasing, and sawing.
(b) The term “extrusion die cleaning” shall mean the process by which the steel dies used in extrusion of aluminum are cleaned. The term includes a dip into a concentrated caustic bath to dissolve the aluminum followed by a water rinse. It also includes the use of a wet scrubber with the die cleaning operation.
(c) The term “ancillary operation” shall mean any operation not previously included in the core, performed on-site, following or preceding the extrusion operation. The ancillary operations shall include direct chill casting, press or solution heat treatment, cleaning or etching, degassing, and extrusion press hydraulic fluid leakage.
§ 467.32
Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available:

Monitoring.
(a) In lieu of monitoring for TTO, the permitting authority may allow direct dischargers to include the following certification as a “comment” on the Discharge Monitoring Report required by § 122.44 (i), formerly § 122.62(i): “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the permit limitation for total toxic organics (TTO), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no dumping of concentrated toxic organics into the wastewaters has occurred since filing the last discharge monitoring report. I further certify that this facility is implementing the solvent management plan submitted to the permitting authority.”
(b) In requesting that no monitoring of TTO be required, the direct discharger shall submit a solvent management plan that specifies to the permitting authority's satisfaction the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater. The permitting authority shall incorporate the plan as a provision of the permit.
(c) In lieu of monitoring for TTO, the control authority may allow industrial users of POTWs to make the following certification as a comment to the periodic reports required by § 403.12(e): “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for total toxic organics (TTO), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no dumping of concentrated toxic organics into the wastewaters has occurred since filing the last discharge monitoring report. I further certify that this facility is implementing the solvent management plan submitted to the control authority.”
(d) In requesting that no monitoring be required, industrial users of POTWs shall submit a solvent management plan that specifies to the control authority's satisfaction the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such
as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater.

(a) This part applies to discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States and introduction of pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works from the forming of nonferrous metals (including nonferrous metal alloys), except beryllium, copper, and aluminum and their alloys. Aluminum alloys are defined as any alloy in which aluminum is the major constituent in percent by weight. Copper alloys are defined as any alloy in which copper is the major constituent in percent by weight except when copper is alloyed with precious metals. Any copper-precious metal alloy containing 30 percent or greater precious metal is considered a precious metal alloy for the purposes of this part. Beryllium alloys are any alloy in which beryllium is present at 0.1 percent or greater. This part applies to:
(1) Forming operations, including rolling (both hot and cold), extruding, forging, drawing, swaging, cladding, and tube reducing, and
(2) Ancillary operations performed as an integral part of the forming of these metals, including casting for subsequent forming, heat treatment, surface treatment, alkaline cleaning, solvent degreasing, product testing, surface coating, sawing, grinding, tumbling, burnishing, and wet air pollution control.
(b) This part also applies to discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States and introduction of pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works from mechanical metal powder production operations, forming of parts from metal powders, and associated ancillary operations (listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of:
(1) Iron, copper, and aluminum, and their alloys; and
(2) The nonferrous metals and their alloys described in paragraph (a) of this section. This part does not regulate the production of metal powders by chemical means such as precipitation. The production of metal powder as the final step in refining metal is regulated under the Nonferrous Metals Manufacturing Point Source Category regulation, 40 CFR part 421.
(c) Surface treatment includes any chemical or electrochemical treatment applied to the surface of the metal. For the purposes of this regulation, surface treatment of metals is considered to be an integral part of the forming of metals whenever it is performed at the same plant site at which the metals are formed. Such surface treatment operations are not regulated under the Electroplating or Metal Finishing Point Source Category regulations, 40 CFR part 413 or 433, respectively.
(d) Casting is covered by this part when it is performed as an integral part of the metal forming process and takes place at the same plant site at which metals are formed. Such casting will not be regulated under the provisions of Metal Molding and Casting Point Source Category regulations, 40 CFR part 464.
(e) This part does not apply to the forming of the metals cadmium, chromium, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, manganese, neodymium, or praseodymium.
§ 471.02
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a) “Nonferrous metal” is any pure metal other than iron or any metal alloy for which a metal other than iron is its major constituent in percent by weight.
(b) “Forming” is a set of manufacturing operations in which metals and alloys are made into semifinished products by hot or cold working.
(c) “Alkaline cleaning” uses a solution (bath), usually detergent, to remove lard, oil, and other such compounds from a metal surface. Alkaline cleaning is usually followed by a water rinse. The rinse may consist of single or multiple stage rinsing. For the purposes of this part, an alkaline cleaning operation is defined as a bath followed by a rinse, regardless of the number of rinse stages. Each alkaline cleaning bath and rinse combination is entitled to a discharge allowance.
(d) “Atomization” is the process in which a stream of water or gas impinges upon a molten metal stream, breaking it into droplets which solidify as powder particles.
(e) “Burnishing” is a surface finishing process in which minute surface irregularities are displaced rather than removed.
(f) “Casting” is pouring molten metal into a mold to produce an object of desired shape.
(g) “Cladding” or “metal cladding” is the art of producing a composite metal containing two or more layers that have been metallurgically bonded together by roll bonding (co-rolling), solder application (or brazing), or explosion bonding.
(h) “Contact cooling water” is any wastewater which contacts the metal workpiece or the raw materials used in forming metals for the purpose of removing heat from the metal.
(i) “Continuous casting” is the production of sheet, rod, or other long shapes by solidifying the metal while it is being poured through an open-ended mold.
(j) “Degreasing” is the removal of oils and greases from the surface of the metal workpiece. This process can be accomplished with detergents as in alkaline cleaning or by the use of solvents.
(k) “Direct chill casting” is the pouring of molten nonferrous metal into a water-cooled mold. Contact cooling water is sprayed onto the metal as it is dropped into the mold, and the metal ingot falls into a water bath at the end of the casting process.
(l) “Drawing” is the process of pulling a metal through a die or succession of dies to reduce the metal's diameter or alter its cross-sectional shape.
(m) “Dye penetrant testing” is a nondestructive method for finding discontinuities that are open to the surface of the metal. A dye is applied to the surface of metal and the excess is rinsed off. Dye that penetrates surface discontinuities will not be rinsed away thus marking these discontinuities.
(n) “Emulsions” are stable dispersions of two immiscible liquids. In the Nonferrous Metals Forming and Metal Powders Point Source category, this is usually an oil and water mixture.
(o) “Electrocoating” is the electrodeposition of a metallic or nonmetallic coating onto the surface of a workpiece.
(p) “Extrusion” is the application of pressure to a billet of metal, forcing the metal to flow through a die orifice.
(q) “Forging” is deforming metal, usually hot, with compressive force into desired shapes, with or without dies. Where dies are used, the metal is forced to take the shape of the die.
(r) “Grinding” is the process of removing stock from a workpiece by the use of a tool consisting of abrasive grains held by a rigid or semi-rigid grinder. Grinding includes surface finishing, sanding, and slicing.
(s) “Heat treatment” is the application of heat of specified temperature and duration to change the physical properties of the metal.
(t) “Hot pressing” is forming a powder metallurgy compact at a temperature high enough to effect concurrent sintering.
(u) “Hydrotesting” is the testing of piping or tubing by filling with water and pressurizing to test for integrity.
(v) “Impregnation” is the process of filling pores of a formed powder part, usually with a liquid such as a lubricant, or mixing particles of a nonmetallic substance in a matrix of metal powder.
(w) “In-process control technology” is the conservation of chemicals and water throughout the production operations to reduce the amount of wastewater to be discharged.
(x) “Metal powder production” operations are mechanical process operations which convert metal to a finely divided form.
(y) “Milling” is the mechanical treatment of a nonferrous metal to produce powder, or to coat one component of a powder mixture with another.
(z) “Neat oil” is a pure oil with no or few impurities added. In nonferrous metals forming, its use is mostly as a lubricant.
(aa) “Powder forming” includes forming and compressing powder into a fully dense finished shape, and is usually done within closed dies.
(bb) “Precious metals” include gold, platinum, palladium, and silver and their alloys. Any alloy containing 30 or greater percent by weight of precious metals is considered a precious metal alloy.
(cc) “Product testing” includes operations such as dye penetrant testing, hydrotesting, and ultrasonic testing.
(dd) “Refractory metals” includes the metals of columbium, tantalum, molybdenum, rhenium, tungsten and vanadium and their alloys.
(ee) “Rolling” is the reduction in thickness or diameter of a workpiece by passing it between lubricated steel rollers.
(ff) “Roll bonding” is the process by which a permanent bond is created between two metals by rolling under high pressure in a bonding mill (co-rolling).
(gg) “Sawing” is cutting a workpiece with a band, blade, or circular disc having teeth.
(hh) “Shot casting” is the production of shot by pouring molten metal in finely divided streams to form spherical particles.
(ii) “Stationary casting” is the pouring of molten metal into molds and allowing the metal to cool.
(jj) “Surface treatment” is a chemical or electrochemical treatment applied to the surface of a metal. Such treatments include pickling, etching, conversion coating, phosphating, and chromating. Surface treatment baths are usually followed by a water rinse. The rinse may consist of single or multiple stage rinsing. For the purposes of this part, a surface treatment operation is defined as a bath followed by a rinse, regardless of the number of stages. Each surface treatment bath,
rinse combination is entitled to discharge allowance.
(kk) “Swaging” is a process in which a solid point is formed at the end of a tube, rod, or bar by the repeated blows of one or more pairs of opposing dies.
(ll) “Tube reducing” is an operation which reduces the diameter and wall thickness of tubing with a mandrel and a pair of rolls with tapered grooves.
(mm) “Tumbling” or “barrel finishing” is an operation in which castings, forgings, or parts pressed from metal powder are rotated in a barrel with ceramic or metal slugs or abrasives to remove scale, fins, or burrs. It may be done dry or with an aqueous solution.
(nn) “Ultrasonic testing” is a nondestructive test which applies sound, at a frequency above about 20 HJz, to metal, which has been immersed in liquid (usually water) to locate inhomogeneities or structural discontinuities.
(oo) “Wet air pollution control scrubbers” are air pollution control devices used to remove particulates and fumes from air by entraining the pollutants in a water spray.
(pp) “Grab sample” is a single sample which is collected at a time and place most representative of total discharge.
(qq) “Composite sample” is a sample composed of no less than eight grab samples taken over the compositing period.
(rr) A “flow proportional composite sample” is composed of grab samples collected continuously or discretely in proportion to the total flow at time of collection or to the total flow since collection of the previous grab sample. The grab volume or frequency of grab collection may be varied in proportion to flow.
(ss) The term “control authority” is defined as the POTW if it has an approved pretreatment program; in the absence of such a program, the NPDES State if it has an approved pretreatment program or EPA if the State does not have an approved program.
(tt) “Continuous operations” means that the industrial user introduces regulated wastewaters to the POTW throughout the operating hours of the facility, except for infrequent shutdowns for maintenance, process changes, or other similar activities.
(uu) “Intermittent operations” means the industrial users does not have a continuous operation.
(vv) The term “off-kg (off-lb)” means the mass of metal or metal alloy removed from a forming operation at the end of a process cycle for transfer to a different machine or process.

(1) There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants except as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) Process wastewater pollutants may be discharged, with no allowance for any pollutants discharged, provided the facility owner or operator demonstrates, on the basis of analytical methods set forth in or approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 136, that the concentrations of nitrosamine compounds in the wastewater discharged from the tube reducing process do not exceed 0.050 mg/l of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
(3) The demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until the demonstration has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months, after which time the demonstration may be made once per quarter. If a sample is found to contain any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds at concentrations greater than those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the actions described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be taken, and the demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until it has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months.
(4) If sampling results show that any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds is present in the process wastewater at concentrations greater than those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator shall ensure that, within thirty days of receiving written notification of the sampling results, there is no further discharge of tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater until the owner or operator:
(i) Performs a subsequent analysis which demonstrates that the concentrations of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds do not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Substitutes a new tube reducing lubricant and thereafter complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
(iii) Determines the source of the pollutant whose concentration exceeded the level specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the NPDES issuing authority that such source has been eliminated.
(5) The concentration limits specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply
at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process. However, sampling after the tube reducing wastewater has been commingled with other wastewaters is permitted if:
(i) Any dilution caused by the other wastewaters is taken into account in determining the appropriate (
i.e.
, lower) allowable discharge concentration; and
(ii) An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity is used to measure the levels of each of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaters being sampled.

(d)
Tube Reducing Spent Lubricant—subpart C—NSPS.
(1) There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants except as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) Process wastewater pollutants may be discharged, with no allowance for any pollutants discharged, provided the facility owner or operator demonstrates, on the basis of analytical methods set forth in or approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 136, that the concentrations of nitrosamine compounds in the wastewater discharged from the tube reducing process do not exceed 0.050mg/l of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
(3) The demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until the demonstration has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months, after which time the demonstration may be made once per quarter. If a sample is found to contain any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds at concentrations greater than
those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the actions described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be taken, and the demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until it has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months.
(4) If sampling results show that any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds is present in the process wastewater at concentrations greater than those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator shall ensure that, within thirty days of receiving written notification of the sampling results, there is no further discharge of tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater until the owner or operator:
(i) Performs a subsequent analysis which demonstrates that the concentrations of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds do not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Substitutes a new tube reducing lubricant and thereafter complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
(iii) Determines the source of the pollutant whose concentration exceeded the level specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the NPDES issuing authority that such source has been eliminated.
(5) The concentration limits specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process. However, sampling after the tube reducing wastewater has been commingled with other wastewaters is permitted if:
(i) Any dilution caused by the other wastewaters is taken into account in determining the appropriate (
i.e.
, lower) allowable discharge concentration; and
(ii) An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity is used to measure the levels of each of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaters being sampled.
(e)
Drawing spent neat oils—subpart C—NSPS.
There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants.

(1) There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants except as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) Process wastewater pollutants may be discharged, with no allowance for any pollutants discharged, provided the facility owner or operator demonstrates, on the basis of analytical methods set forth in or approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 136, that the concentrations of nitrosamine compounds in the wastewater discharged from the tube reducing process do not exceed 0.050 mg/l of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
(3) The demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until the demonstration has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months, after which time the demonstration may be made once per quarter. If a sample is found to contain any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds at concentrations greater than those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the actions described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be taken, and the demonstration required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until it has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months.
(4) If sampling results show that any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds is present in the process wastewater at concentrations greater than those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator shall ensure that, within thirty days of receiving written notification of the sampling results, there is no further discharge of tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater until the owner or operator:
(i) Performs a subsequent analysis which demonstrates that the concentrations of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds do not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Substitutes a new tube reducing lubricant and thereafter complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
(iii) Determines the source of the pollutant whose concentration exceeded the level specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the POTW control authority that such source has been eliminated.
(5) The concentration limits specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process. However, sampling after the tube reducing wastewater has been commingled with other wastewaters is permitted if:
(i) Any dilution caused by the other wastewaters is taken into account in determining the appropriate (
i.e.
, lower) allowable discharge concentration; and
(ii) An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity is used to measure the levels of each of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaters being sampled.

(1) There shall be no
discharge of process wastewater pollutants except as provided under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(2) Process wastewater pollutants may be discharged, with no allowance for any pollutants discharged, provided the facility owner or operator demonstrates, on the basis of analytical methods set forth in or approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 136, that the concentrations of nitrosamine compounds in the wastewater discharged from the tube reducing process do not exceed 0.050 mg/l of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
(3) The demonstration required under subparagraph (g)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until the demonstration has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months, after which time the demonstration may be made once per quarter. If a sample is found to contain any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds at concentrations greater than those specified in subparagraph (g)(2) of this section, the actions described in paragraph (g)(4), of this section shall be taken, and the demonstration required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until it has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months.
(4) If sampling results show that any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds is present in the process wastewater at concentrations greater than those specified in subparagraph (g)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator shall ensure that, within thirty days of receiving written notification of the sampling results, there is no further discharge of tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater until the owner or operator:
(i) Performs a subsequent analysis which demonstrates that the concentrations of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds do not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Substitutes a new tube reducing lubricant and thereafter complies with the requirements of paragraph (g)(3) of this section; or
(iii) Determines the source of the pollutant whose concentration exceeded the level specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the NPDES issuing authority that such source has been eliminated.
(5) The concentration limits specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section apply at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process. However, sampling after the tube reducing wastewater has been commingled with other wastewaters is permitted if:
(i) Any dilution caused by the other wastewaters is taken into account in determining the appropriate (
i.e.
, lower) allowable discharge concentration; and
(ii) An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity is used to measure the levels of each of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaters being sampled.

Tube Reducing Spent Lubricant—subpart I—PSNS.
(1) There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants except as provided under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(2) Process wastewater pollutants may be discharged, with no allowance for any pollutants discharged, provided the facility owner or operator demonstrates, on the basis of analytical methods set forth in or approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 136, that the concentrations of nitrosamine compounds in the wastewater discharged from the tube reducing process do not exceed 0.050 mg/l of N-nitrosodimethylamine, 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and 0.020 mg/l of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine.
(3) The demonstration required under subparagraph (g)(2) of this section shall be made once per month until the demonstration has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months, after which time the demonstration may be made once per quarter. If a sample is found to contain any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds at concentrations greater than those specified in subparagraph (g)(2) of this section, the actions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section shall be taken, and the demonstration required under paragraph (g)(2) shall be made once per month until it has been made for all three nitrosamine compounds for six consecutive months.
(4) If sampling results show that any of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds is present in the process wastewater at concentrations greater than those specified in subparagraph (g)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator shall ensure that, within thirty days of receiving written notification of the sampling results, there is no further discharge of tube reducing spent lubricant wastewater until the owner or operator:
(i) Performs a subsequent analysis which demonstrates that the concentrations of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds do not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Substitutes a new tube reducing lubricant and thereafter complies with the requirements of paragraph (g)(3) of this section; or
(iii) Determines the source of the pollutant whose concentration exceeded the level specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the POTW control authority that such source has been eliminated.
(5) The concentration limits specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section apply at the point of discharge from the tube reducing process. However, sampling after the tube reducing wastewater has been commingled with other wastewaters is permitted if:
(i) Any dilution caused by the other wastewaters is taken into account in determining the appropriate (
i.e.
, lower) allowable discharge concentration; and
(ii) An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity is used to measure the levels of each of the foregoing nitrosamine compounds in the wastewaters being sampled.

# Subpart A—Purpose, Scope and General Program Requirements
§ 501.1
Purpose and scope.
(a) These regulations are promulgated under the authority of sections 101(e), 405(f), 501(a), and 518(e) of the CWA, and implement the requirements of those sections.
(b) This part specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing State sludge management programs under section 405(f), and the requirements State programs must meet to be approved by the Administrator under section 405(f) of CWA. Sludge Management Program submissions may be developed and implemented under any existing or new State authority or authorities as long as they meet the requirements of this part.
(c) Any complete State Sludge Management Program submitted for approval under this part shall have the following as a minimum:
(1) The authority to require compliance by any person who uses or disposes of sewage sludge with standards for sludge use or disposal issued under section 405(d) of the CWA, including compliance by federal facilities;
(2) The authority to issue permits that apply, and ensure compliance with, the applicable requirements of section 405 of the Clean Water Act to any POTW or other treatment works treating domestic sewage, and procedures for issuance of such permits;
(3) Provisions for regulating the use or disposal of sewage sludge by non-permittees;
(4) The authority to take actions to protect public health and the environment from any adverse effects that may occur from toxic pollutants in sewage sludge; and
(5) The authority to abate violations of the State sludge program, including civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of enforcement. Indian Tribes can satisfy criminal enforcement authority requirements under § 501.25.
(d) In addition, any complete State Sludge Management Program submitted for approval under this part must have authority to regulate all sewage sludge management activities subject to 40 CFR part 503, unless the State is applying for partial sludge program approval in accordance with
paragraph (m) of this section. The State sludge management program must include authority to regulate all Federal facilities in the State. Sludge management activities must include as applicable:
(1) Land application;
(2) Landfilling in a Municipal Solid Waste Landfill regulated under 40 CFR part 258;
(3) Incineration;
(4) Surface disposal; and
(5) Any other sludge use or disposal practices that may subsequently be regulated by 40 CFR part 503.
(e) The Administrator will approve State programs which conform to the applicable requirements of this part.
(f)(1) Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator will suspend the issuance of federal permits for those activities subject to the approved State program. After program approval EPA will retain jurisdiction over any permits (including general permits) which it has issued unless arrangements have been made with the State in the Memorandum of Agreement for the State to assume responsibility for these permits. Retention of jurisdiction will include the processing of any permit appeals, modification requests, or variance requests; the conduct of inspections, and the receipt and review of self-monitoring reports. If any permit appeal, modification request, or variance request is not finally resolved when the federally issued permit expires, EPA may, with the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is resolved.
(2) The procedures outlined in the preceding paragraph (f)(1) of this section for the suspension of permitting authority and transfer of existing permits will also apply when EPA approves an Indian Tribe's application to operate a State sludge management program and a State was the authorized permitting authority under § 501.13 for sludge management activities within the scope of the newly approved program. The authorized State will retain jurisdiction over its existing permits as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section absent a different arrangement stated in the Memorandum of Agreement executed between EPA and the Tribe.
(g) Notwithstanding approval of a State sludge program, EPA has the authority to take enforcement actions for any violations of this part or sections 405 or 309 of the CWA.
(h) Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(i) Nothing in this part precludes a State or political subdivision thereof, or interstate agency, from adopting or enforcing requirements established by State or local law that are more stringent or more extensive than those required in this part or in any other federal statute or regulation.
(j) Nothing in this part precludes a State from operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. If an approved State program has greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally approved program.
(k) Sections 106 (a) and (d) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), 33 U.S.C. 1416, generally preclude States from regulating or issuing permits for ocean dumping. Nothing in this regulation is intended to confer on the States the authority to engage in the regulation or permitting of ocean dumping in contravention of the provisions of sections 106 (a) and (d) of the MPRSA.
(l) The Administrator may allow a State sewage sludge management agency to assign portions of its program responsibilities to local agencies, provided that:
(1) No assignment is made to a local agency which owns or operates a POTW or other facility that treats or disposes of sewage sludge;
(2) The program description required by § 501.12 of this part identifies any assignment of program responsibilities to the local agency(ies), describes the capabilities of the local agency to carry out assigned functions, and includes copies of any documents which execute the assignment and an agreement between the State sewage sludge management agency and the local agency(ies) defining their respective program responsibilities;
(3) The Attorney General's Statement required by § 501.13 of this part
states that any assignment of program responsibilities to the local agency(ies) described in the program description is valid under State law and that State and local law do not otherwise prohibit the local agency(ies) from executing the program responsibilities assigned by the State sewage sludge management agency;
(4) The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) required by § 501.14 of this part includes adequate provisions for the State sewage sludge management agency's oversight of the program responsibilities assigned to the local agency(ies);
(5) The State sewage sludge management agency retains all responsibility for the program reporting required by § 501.21 of this part and for all other activities required by this part or by the MOA related to EPA oversight of the State's approved program; and
(6) The State sewage sludge management agency retains full authority and ultimate responsibility for administering all aspects of the State's approved program in accordance with the requirements of this part and the MOA.
(m) A State whose sludge management program has not been approved under this part may submit to the Regional Administrator an application for approval of a partial sewage sludge program. The following are the requirements for approval of a partial program:
(1) A partial program submission must constitute a complete management program covering one or more categories of sewage sludge use or disposal. The program must also apply to anyone engaged in the sewage sludge use or disposal practice that is the subject of the partial program. A complete management program is one that provides for the issuance of permits, the monitoring of compliance and, in the event of violations, possible enforcement action.
(2) The partial program submission must also address the following requirements:
(i) The Attorney General's Statement, in addition to the information required by § 501.13, must clearly explain the jurisdiction of the administering agency or department;
(ii) The program description, in addition to the information required by § 501.12, must explain how the program will operate, including which use and disposal practice(s) the State will cover. The program description must also explain the relationship and coordination between the proposed partial sewage sludge program and that part of the program for which EPA will remain the permitting authority, including a discussion of the division of permitting, enforcement, and compliance monitoring responsibilities between the State and EPA; and
(iii) The Memorandum of Agreement between EPA and the State, in addition to the information required by § 501.14, must set out the responsibilities of EPA and the State in administering the partial program, including specific provisions for transfer of information and determination of which users or disposers of sewage sludge are included in the partial program.

The Administrator will not approve any Memorandum of Agreement which contains provisions which restrict EPA's exercise of its oversight responsibility.
(b) The Memorandum of Agreement shall include the following:
(1)(i) Provisions for the prompt transfer from EPA to the State of pending permit applications applicable to the State program (or portion of the State program for which the State seeks approval) and any other information relevant to program operation not already in the possession of the State Director (e.g., support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.). If existing permits are transferred from EPA to the State for administration, the Memorandum of Agreement must contain provisions specifying a procedure for transferring the administration of these permits. If a State lacks the authority to directly administer permits issued by the federal government, a procedure may be established to transfer responsibility for these permits.
(ii) Where a State has been authorized by EPA to issue permits in accordance with § 501.13 on the Federal Indian reservation of the Indian Tribe seeking program approval, provisions describing how the transfer of pending permit applications, permits, and any other information relevant to the program operation not already in the possession of the Indian Tribe (support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.) will be accomplished.
(2) Provisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits, and proposed permits that the State will send to the Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection. These provisions must follow the permit review procedures set forth in 40 CFR 123.44.
(3) The Memorandum of Agreement must also specify the extent to which EPA will waive its right to review, object to, or comment upon State-issued permits.
(4) Whenever a waiver is granted under paragraph (3) of this section, the Memorandum of Agreement shall contain a statement that the Regional Administrator retains the right to terminate the waiver as to future permit actions, in whole or in part, at any time by sending the State Director written notice of termination.
(5) Provisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to EPA. The State shall allow EPA to routinely review State records, reports, and files relevant to the administration and enforcement of the approved program. State reports may be combined with grant reports where appropriate. The procedures shall implement the requirements of § 501.21.
(c) The Memorandum of Agreement must also provide for the following:
(1) The circumstances in which the State must promptly send notices, draft permits, final permits, or related documents to the Regional Administrator; and
(2) Provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement program, including:
(i) Provisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA. These may specify the basis on which the Regional Administrator will select facilities or activities within the State for EPA inspection; and
(ii) Procedures to assure coordination of enforcement activities.
(3) When appropriate, provisions for joint processing of permits by the State and EPA for facilities or activities which require permits from both EPA and the State under different programs (see for example 40 CFR 124.4).
(4) Provisions for modification of the Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with this part.
(5) Provisions for modification of the Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with this part.
(d) The Memorandum of Agreement, the annual program grant and the State/EPA Agreement should be consistent. If the State/EPA Agreement indicates that a change is needed in the
Memorandum of Agreement, the Memorandum of Agreement may be amended through the procedures set forth in this part. The State/EPA Agreement may not override the Memorandum of Agreement.
(The information collection requirements in paragraph (c) of this section have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2040-0128)

(1)
Confidentiality of information.
Claims of confidentiality will be denied for the following information:
(i) The name and address of any permit applicant or permittee;
(ii) Permit applications, permits, and sewage sludge data. This includes information submitted on the permit application forms themselves and any attachments used to supply information required by the forms.
(2)
Duration of permits.
(i) NPDES permits issued to treatment works treating domestic sewage pursuant to section 405(f) of the CWA will be effective for a fixed term not to exceed five years.
(ii) Non-NPDES Permits issued to treatment works treating domestic sewage pursuant to section 405(f) of the CWA will be effective for a fixed term not to exceed ten years.
(3)
Schedules of compliance
—(i)
General.
The permit may, when appropriate, specify a schedule of compliance leading to compliance with the CWA and the requirements of this part. Any schedules of compliance under this section must require compliance as soon as possible, but not later than any applicable statutory deadline under the CWA.
(ii)
Interim dates.
If a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which exceeds one year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule must set forth interim requirements and the date for their achievement, as appropriate.
(iii)
Reporting.
The permit must be written to require that no later than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of compliance, the permittee must notify the Director in writing of its compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements, or submit progress reports if paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section is applicable.
(4)
Information requirements:
All treatment works treating domestic sewage shall submit to the Director within the time frames established in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section the information listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (xii) of this section. The Director of an approved state program that chooses to receive electronic documents must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).
(b)
Conditions applicable to all permits.
In addition to permit conditions which must be developed on a case-by-case basis in order to meet applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 503, paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and permit conditions developed on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgment to protect public health and the environment from the adverse effects of toxic pollutants in sewage sludge, all permits must contain the following permit conditions (or comparable conditions as provided for in the Memorandum of Agreement):
(1)
Duty to comply.
The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a permit renewal application.
(2)
Compliance with sludge standards.
The permittee shall comply with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under section 405(d) of the CWA (40 CFR part 503) within the time provided in the regulations that establish such standards, even if this permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the standards.
(3)
CWA penalties.
Section 309 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) sets out penalties applicable to persons who violate the Act's requirements. For example, section 309(d) provides that any person who violates a permit condition implementing sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Clean Water Act is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Such violations also may be subject to administrative penalties assessed by the Administrator pursuant to section 309(g) of the CWA. Any person who negligently violates permit conditions implementing sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, or 405 of the Clean Water Act is subject to a fine not less than $2,500 nor more than $25,000 per day of violation or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.

(12)
Notice requirements
—(i)
Planned changes.
The permittee shall give notice to the Director as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility, or significant changes planned in the permittee's sludge disposal practice, where such alterations, additions, or changes may justify the application of permit conditions that are different from or absent in the existing permit, including notification of additional disposal sites not reported during the permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved land application plan.
(ii)
Anticipated noncompliance.
The permittee shall give advance notice to the Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.

(13)
Reopener.
If a standard for sewage sludge use or disposal applicable to
permittee's use or disposal methods is promulgated under section 405(d) of the CWA before the expiration of this permit, and that standard is more stringent than the sludge pollutant limits or acceptable management practices authorized in this permit, or controls a pollutant or practice not limited in this permit, this permit may be promptly modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the standard for sludge use or disposal promulgated under section 405(d) of the CWA.
(14)
Duty to reapply.
If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the permittee must apply for a new permit.

(1)
Transfer of permits
—(i)
Transfers by modification.
Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this section, a permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and reissued to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary to assure compliance with the CWA.
(ii)
Automatic transfers.
As an alternative to transfers under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the State Director may authorize automatic transfer of any sludge permit to a new permittee if:
(A) The current permittee notifies the Director at least 30 days in advance of the proposed transfer date in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section;
(B) The notice includes a written agreement between the existing and new permittees containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between them; and
(C) The Director does not notify the existing permittee and the proposed new permittee of his or her intent to modify or revoke and reissue the permit. If this notice is not received, the transfer is effective on the date specified in the agreement mentioned in paragraph (c)(ii)(B) of this section.
(2)
Modification or revocation and reissuance of permits.
(i) When the Director receives any information (for example, where the Director inspects the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as required in the permit, receives a request for modification or revocation and reissuance under § 501.15(d)(2)(i), or conducts a review of the permit file), he or she may determine whether or not one or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section for modification or revocation and reissuance or both exist. If cause exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit and may request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified, only the conditions subject to a modification are reopened. If a permit is revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. A draft permit must be prepared and other procedures in § 501.15(d) followed. If cause does not exist under this section, the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit.
(ii)
Causes for modification.
The following are causes for modification but not revocation and reissuance of permits except when the permittee requests or agrees.

(B)
Information.
The Director has received new information. Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.
(C)
New regulations.
New regulations have been promulgated under section 405(d) of the CWA, or the standards or regulations on which the permit was
based have been changed by promulgation of amended standards or regulations or by judicial decision after the permit was issued.
(D)
Compliance schedules.
The Director determines good cause exists for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an Act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonable available remedy. However, in no case may a compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable CWA statutory deadline.
(E)
Land application plans.
When required by a permit condition to incorporate a land application plan for beneficial reuse of sewage sludge, to revise an existing land application plan, or to add a land application plan.
(iii) The following are causes to modify or alternatively, revoke and reissue, a permit.
(A) Cause exists for termination under § 501.15(c)(3) and the Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is appropriate.
(B) The Director has received notification (as required in the permit, see § 501.15(b)(12)(iii)) of a proposed transfer of the permit.
(3)
Termination of permits.
The following are causes for terminating a permit during its term, or for denying a permit renewal application:
(i) Noncompliance by the permittee with any condition of the permit;
(ii) The permittee's failure in the application or during the permit issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the permittee's misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time;

§ 501.16
Requirements for compliance evaluation programs.
State sludge management programs shall have requirements and procedures for compliance monitoring and evaluation as set forth in § 123.26.
§ 501.17
Requirements for enforcement authority.
(a) Any State agency administering a program shall have available the following remedies for violations of State program requirements:
(1) To restrain immediately and effectively any person by order or by suit in State court from engaging in any unauthorized activity which is endangering or causing damage to public health or the environment;

# Note:
This paragraph ((a)(1)) requires that States have a mechanism (e.g., an administrative cease and desist order or the ability to seek a temporary restraining order) to stop any unauthorized activity endangering public health or the environment.
(2) To sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of any program requirement, including permit conditions, without the necessity of a prior revocation of the permit; and
(3) To assess or sue to recover in court civil penalties and to seek criminal remedies, including fines, as follows:
(i) Civil penalties will be recoverable for the violation of any permit condition; any applicable standard or limitation; any filing requirement; any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities; or any regulation or orders issued by the State Program Director. The State must at a minimum, have the authority to assess penalties of up to $5,000 a day for each violation. The civil monetary penalty amount listed in this section may not reflect recent inflation adjustments EPA is required to make. The current maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts are located in § 19.4.
(ii) Criminal fines will be recoverable against any person who willfully or negligently violates any applicable standards or limitations; any permit condition; or any filing requirement.

# Appendix A to Part 503—Procedure To Determine the Annual Whole Sludge Application Rate for a Sewage Sludge
Section 503.13(a)(4)(ii) requires that the product of the concentration for each pollutant listed in Table 4 of § 503.13 in sewage sludge sold or given away in a bag or other container for application to the land and the annual whole sludge application rate (AWSAR) for the sewage sludge not cause the annual pollutant loading rate for the pollutant in Table 4 of § 503.13 to be exceeded. This appendix contains the procedure used to determine the AWSAR for a sewage sludge that does not cause the annual pollutant loading rates in Table 4 of § 503.13 to be exceeded.
The relationship between the annual pollutant loading rate (APLR) for a pollutant and the annual whole sludge application rate (AWSAR) for 1a sewage sludge is shown in equation (1).
EC15NO91.200
Where:
APLR = Annual pollutant loading rate in kilograms per hectare per 365 day period.
C = Pollutant concentration in milligrams, per kilogram of total solids (dry weight basis).
AWSAR = Annual whole sludge application rate in metric tons per hectare per 365 day period (dry weight basis).
0.001 = A conversion factor.
To determine the AWSAR, equation (1) is rearranged into equation (2):
EC15NO91.201
The procedure used to determine the AWSAR for a sewage sludge is presented below.

# Procedure:
1. Analyze a sample of the sewage sludge to determine the concentration for each of the pollutants listed in Table 4 of § 503.13 in the sewage sludge.
2. Using the pollutant concentrations from Step 1 and the APLRs from Table 4 of § 503.13, calculate an AWSAR for each pollutant using equation (2) above.
3. The AWSAR for the sewage sludge is the lowest AWSAR calculated in Step 2.

# Appendix B to Part 503—Pathogen Treatment Processes

# A. Processes To Significantly Reduce Pathogens (PSRP)
1. Aerobic digestion—Sewage sludge is agitated with air or oxygen to maintain aerobic conditions for a specific mean cell residence time at a specific temperature. Values for the mean cell residence time and temperature shall be between 40 days at 20 degrees Celsius and 60 days at 15 degrees Celsius.
2. Air drying—Sewage sludge is dried on sand beds or on paved or unpaved basins. The sewage sludge dries for a minimum of three months. During two of the three months, the ambient average daily temperature is above zero degrees Celsius.
3. Anaerobic digestion—Sewage sludge is treated in the absence of air for a specific mean cell residence time at a specific temperature. Values for the mean cell residence time and temperature shall be between 15 days at 35 to 55 degrees Celsius and 60 days at 20 degrees Celsius.
4. Composting—Using either the within-vessel, static aerated pile, or windrow composting methods, the temperature of the sewage sludge is raised to 40 degrees Celsius or higher and remains at 40 degrees Celsius or higher for five days. For four hours during the five days, the temperature in the compost pile exceeds 55 degrees Celsius.
5. Lime stabilization—Sufficient lime is added to the sewage sludge to raise the pH of the sewage sludge to 12 after two hours of contact.
B. Processes to Further Reduce Pathogens (PFRP)
1. Composting—Using either the within-vessel composting method or the static aerated pile composting method, the temperature of the sewage sludge is maintained at 55 degrees Celsius or higher for three days.
Using the windrow composting method, the temperature of the sewage sludge is maintained at 55 degrees or higher for 15 days or longer. During the period when the compost is maintained at 55 degrees or higher, there shall be a minimum of five turnings of the windrow.
2. Heat drying—Sewage sludge is dried by direct or indirect contact with hot gases to reduce the moisture content of the sewage sludge to 10 percent or lower. Either the temperature of the sewage sludge particles exceeds 80 degrees Celsius or the wet bulb temperature of the gas in contact with the sewage sludge as the sewage sludge leaves the dryer exceeds 80 degrees Celsius.
3. Heat treatment—Liquid sewage sludge is heated to a temperature of 180 degrees Celsius or higher for 30 minutes.
4. Thermophilic aerobic digestion—Liquid sewage sludge is agitated with air or oxygen to maintain aerobic conditions and the mean cell residence time of the sewage sludge is 10 days at 55 to 60 degrees Celsius.
5. Beta ray irradiation—Sewage sludge is irradiated with beta rays from an accelerator at dosages of at least 1.0 megarad at room temperature (ca. 20 degrees Celsius).
(6) Gamma ray irradiation—Sewage sludge is irradiated with gamma rays from certain isotopes, such as
60
Cobalt and
137
Cesium, at dosages of at least 1.0 megarad at room temperature (ca. 20 °Celsius).
7. Pasteurization—The temperature of the sewage sludge is maintained at 70 degrees Celsius or higher for 30 minutes or longer.

FE
. The test procedures in subpart B of this part also apply to 2014 and later heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards under 40 CFR part 86, subpart S.
(b) The provisions of subparts A, D, and F of this part are optional through the 2011 model year in the following cases:
(1) Manufacturers that produce only electric vehicles are exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except with regard to the requirements in those sections pertaining specifically to electric vehicles.
(2) Manufacturers with worldwide production (excluding electric vehicle production) of less than 10,000 gasoline-fueled and/or diesel powered passenger automobiles and light trucks may optionally comply with the electric vehicle requirements in this subpart.

(d) The model year of initial applicability for sections in this part is indicated by the section number. The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is applicable. An individual section continues to apply for later model years until it is replaced by a different section that applies starting in a later model year. Sections that have no two-digit suffix apply for all 2008 and later model year vehicles, except as noted in those sections. If a section has a two-digit suffix but the regulation references that section without including the two-digit suffix, this refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year. This also applies for references to part 86 of this chapter. As an example, § 600.113-08 applies to the 2008 and subsequent model years until § 600.113-12 is applicable beginning with the 2012 model year. Section 600.111-08 would then apply only for 2008 through 2011 model year vehicles.
(e) The term “you” in this part refers to manufacturers subject to the requirements of this part.
(f) Unless we specify otherwise, send all reports and requests for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer (see § 600.002).

§ 600.007
Vehicle acceptability.
(a) All certification vehicles and other vehicles tested to meet the requirements of part 86 of this chapter (other than those chosen under the durability-demonstration provisions in § 86.1829 of this chapter), are considered to have met the requirements of this section.
(b) Any vehicle not meeting the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must be judged acceptable by the Administrator under this section in order for the test results to be reviewed for use in subpart C or F of this part. The Administrator will judge the acceptability of a fuel economy data vehicle on the basis of the information supplied by the manufacturer under § 600.006(b). The criteria to be met are:
(1) A fuel economy data vehicle may have accumulated not more than 10,000 miles. A vehicle will be considered to have met this requirement if the engine and drivetrain have accumulated 10,000 or fewer miles. The Administrator may specify a different maximum value for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles that allows for the necessary operation for properly evaluating and characterizing those vehicles under this part. The components installed for
a fuel economy test are not required to be the ones with which the mileage was accumulated, e.g., axles, transmission types, and tire sizes may be changed. The Administrator will determine if vehicle/engine component changes are acceptable.
(2) A vehicle may be tested in different vehicle configurations by change of vehicle components, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or by testing in different inertia weight classes. Also, a single vehicle may be tested under different test conditions,
i.e.,
test weight and/or road load horsepower, to generate fuel economy data representing various situations within a vehicle configuration. For purposes of this part, data generated by a single vehicle tested in various test conditions will be treated as if the data were generated by the testing of multiple vehicles.
(3) The mileage on a fuel economy data vehicle must be, to the extent possible, accumulated according to § 86.1831 of this chapter.
(4) Each fuel economy data vehicle must meet the same exhaust emission standards as certification vehicles of the respective engine-system combination during the test in which the fuel economy test results are generated. This may be demonstrated using one of the following methods:
(i) The deterioration factors established for the respective engine-system combination per § 86.1841 of this chapter as applicable will be used; or
(ii) The fuel economy data vehicle will be equipped with aged emission control components according to the provisions of § 86.1823 of this chapter.
(5) The calibration information submitted under § 600.006(b) must be representative of the vehicle configuration for which the fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions data were submitted.
(6) Any vehicle tested for fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, or carbon-related exhaust emissions purposes must be representative of a vehicle which the manufacturer intends to produce under the provisions of a certificate of conformity.
(7) For vehicles imported under § 85.1509 or § 85.1511(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), (c)(2) or (d) of this chapter (when applicable), only the following requirements must be met:
(i) For vehicles imported under § 85.1509 of this chapter, a highway fuel economy value must be generated contemporaneously with the emission tests used for purposes of demonstrating compliance with § 85.1509 of this chapter. No modifications or adjustments should be made to the vehicles between the highway fuel economy, FTP, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP tests.
(ii) For vehicles imported under § 85.1509 or § 85.1511(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), or (c)(2) of this chapter (when applicable) with over 10,000 miles, the equation in § 600.006(g)(3) shall be used as though only 10,000 miles had been accumulated.
(iii) Any required fuel economy testing must take place after any safety modifications are completed for each vehicle as required by regulations of the Department of Transportation.
(iv) Every vehicle imported under § 85.1509 or § 85.1511(b)(2), (b)(4), (c)(1), or (c)(2) of this chapter (when applicable) must be considered a separate type for the purposes of calculating a fuel economy label for a manufacturer's average fuel economy.
(c) If, based on review of the information submitted under § 600.006(b), the Administrator determines that a fuel economy data vehicle meets the requirements of this section, the fuel economy data vehicle will be judged to be acceptable and fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emissions data from that fuel economy data vehicle will be reviewed pursuant to § 600.008.
(d) If, based on the review of the information submitted under § 600.006(b), the Administrator determines that a fuel economy data vehicle does not meet the requirements of this section, the Administrator will reject that fuel economy data vehicle and inform the manufacturer of the rejection in writing.
(e) If, based on a review of the emission data for a fuel economy data vehicle, submitted under § 600.006(b), or emission data generated by a vehicle tested under § 600.008(e), the Administrator finds an indication of non-compliance with section 202 of the Clean
Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 1857
et seq.
of the regulation thereunder, he may take such investigative actions as are appropriate to determine to what extent emission non-compliance actually exists.
(1) The Administrator may, under the provisions of § 86.1830 of this chapter, request the manufacturer to submit production vehicles of the configuration(s) specified by the Administrator for testing to determine to what extent emission noncompliance of a production vehicle configuration or of a group of production vehicle configurations may actually exist.
(2) If the Administrator determines, as a result of his investigation, that substantial emission non-compliance is exhibited by a production vehicle configuration or group of production vehicle configurations, he may proceed with respect to the vehicle configuration(s) as provided under section 206 or 207, as applicable, of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 1857
et seq.
(f) All vehicles used to generate fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emissions data, and for which emission standards apply, must be covered by a certificate of conformity under part 86 of this chapter before:
(1) The data may be used in the calculation of any approved general or specific label value, or
(2) The data will be used in any calculations under subpart F, except that vehicles imported under §§ 85.1509 and 85.1511 of this chapter need not be covered by a certificate of conformity.

§ 600.008
Review of fuel economy, CO
2
; emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission data, testing by the Administrator.
(a)
Testing by the Administrator.
(1)(i) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test vehicles be submitted to the Agency, at such place or places as the Agency may designate, for the purposes of conducting fuel economy tests. The Administrator may specify that such testing be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. The tests to be performed may comprise the FTP, highway fuel economy test, US06, SC03, or Cold temperature FTP or any combination of those tests. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible.
(ii) Starting with the 2012 model year for carbon-related exhaust emissions and with the 2013 model year for CO
2
emissions, the evaluations, testing, and test data described in this section pertaining to fuel economy shall also be performed for CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions, except that CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions shall be arithmetically averaged instead of harmonically averaged, and in cases where the manufacturer selects the lowest of several fuel economy results to represent the vehicle, the manufacturer shall select the CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions value from the test results associated with the lowest selected fuel economy results.
(2) Retesting and official data determination. For any vehicles selected for confirmatory testing under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Administrator will follow this procedure:
(i) The manufacturer's fuel economy data (or harmonically averaged data if more than one test was conducted) will be compared with the results of the Administrator's test.
(ii) If, in the Administrator's judgment, the comparison in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section indicates a disparity in the data, the Administrator will repeat the test or tests as applicable.
(A) The manufacturer's average test results and the results of the Administrator's first test will be compared with the results of the Administrator's second test as in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(B) If, in the Administrator's judgment, both comparisons in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, indicate a
disparity in the data, the Administrator will repeat the applicable test or tests until:
(
1
) In the Administrator's judgment no disparity in the data is indicated by comparison of two tests by the Administrator or by comparison of the manufacturer's average test results and a test by the Administrator; or
(
2
) Four tests of a single test type are conducted by the Administrator in which a disparity in the data is indicated when compared as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii) If there is, in the Administrator's judgment, no disparity indicated by comparison of manufacturer's average test results with a test by the Administrator, the test values generated by the Administrator will be used to represent the vehicle.
(iv) If there is, in the Administrator's judgment, no disparity indicated by comparison of two tests by the Administrator, the harmonic averages of the fuel economy results from those tests will be used to represent the vehicle.
(v) If the situation in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section occurs, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, in writing, that the Administrator rejects that fuel economy data vehicle.
(b)
Manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing.
(1) If the Administrator determines not to conduct a confirmatory test under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, manufacturers will conduct a confirmatory test at their facility after submitting the original test data to the Administrator whenever any of the following conditions exist:
(i) The vehicle configuration has previously failed an emission standard;
(ii) The test exhibits high emission levels determined by exceeding a percentage of the standards specified by the Administrator for that model year;
(2) If the Administrator selects the vehicle for confirmatory testing based on the manufacturer's original test results, the testing shall be conducted as ordered by the Administrator. In this case, the manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section would not be required.
(3) The manufacturer shall conduct a retest of the FTP or highway test if the difference between the fuel economy of the confirmatory test and the original manufacturer's test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage to be applied consistently to all manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator).
(i) The manufacturer may, in lieu of conducting a retest, accept the lower of the original and confirmatory test fuel economy results for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(ii) The manufacturer shall conduct a second retest of the FTP or highway test if the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the original manufacturer test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator) and the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test and the first confirmatory test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator). The manufacturer may, in lieu of conducting a second retest, accept the lowest of the original test, the first confirmatory test, and the second confirmatory test fuel economy results for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(4) The Administrator may request the manufacturer to conduct a retest of the US06, SC03 or Cold Temperature FTP on the basis of fuel economy that is higher than expected as specified in criteria provided by the Administrator. Such retests shall not be required before the 2011 model year.
(c)
Review of fuel economy data.
(1) Fuel economy data must be judged reasonable and representative by the Administrator in order for the test results to be used for the purposes of subpart C or F of this part. In making this determination, the Administrator will, when possible, compare the results of a test vehicle to those of other similar test vehicles.
(2) If testing was conducted by the Administrator under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the data from this testing, together with all
other fuel economy data submitted for that vehicle under § 600.006(c) or (e) will be evaluated by the Administrator for reasonableness and representativeness per paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(i) The fuel economy data which are determined to best meet the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be accepted for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(ii) City, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP test data will be considered separately.
(iii) If more than one test was conducted, the Administrator may select an individual test result or the harmonic average of selected test results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) If confirmatory testing was conducted by the manufacturer under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the data from this testing will be evaluated by the Administrator for reasonableness and representativeness per paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(i) The fuel economy data which are determined to best meet the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be accepted for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(ii) City, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP test data will be considered separately.
(iii) If more than one test was conducted, the Administrator may select an individual test result or the harmonic average of selected test results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(4) If no confirmatory testing was conducted by either the Administrator or the manufacturer under the provisions of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section, respectively, then the data submitted under the provisions of § 600.006(c) or (e) shall be accepted for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(i) City, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold temperature FTP test data will be considered separately.
(ii) If more than one test was conducted, the harmonic average of the test results shall be accepted for use in subpart C or F of this part.
(d) If, based on a review of the fuel economy data generated by testing under paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator determines that an unacceptable level of correlation exists between fuel economy data generated by a manufacturer and fuel economy data generated by the Administrator, he/she may reject all fuel economy data submitted by the manufacturer until the cause of the discrepancy is determined and the validity of the data is established by the manufacturer.
(e)(1) If, based on the results of an inspection conducted under § 600.005(b) or any other information, the Administrator has reason to believe that the manufacturer has not followed proper testing procedures or that the testing equipment is faulty or improperly calibrated, or if records do not exist that will enable him to make a finding of proper testing, the Administrator may notify the manufacturer in writing of his finding and require the manufacturer to:
(i) Submit the test vehicle(s) upon which the data are based or additional test vehicle(s) at a place he may designate for the purpose of fuel economy testing.
(ii) Conduct such additional fuel economy testing as may be required to demonstrate that prior fuel economy test data are reasonable and representative.
(2) Previous acceptance by the Administrator of any fuel economy test data submitted by the manufacturer shall not limit the Administrator's right to require additional testing under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3) If, based on tests required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Administrator determines that any fuel economy data submitted by the manufacturer and used to calculate the manufacturer's fuel economy average was unrepresentative, the Administrator may recalculate the manufacturer's fuel economy average based on fuel economy data that he/she deems representative.
(4) A manufacturer may request a hearing as provided in § 600.009 if the Administrator decides to recalculate the manufacturer's average pursuant to determinations made relative to this section.

§ 600.101
Testing overview.
Perform testing under this part as described in § 600.111. This involves the following specific requirements:
(a) Perform the following tests and calculations for LDV, LDT, and MDPV
FE
:
(1) Testing to demonstrate compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and greenhouse gas emission standards generally involves a combination of two cycles—the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test (see 40 CFR 1066.801). Testing to determine values for fuel economy labeling under subpart D of this part generally involves testing with three additional test cycles; § 600.210 describes circumstances in which testing with these additional test cycles does not apply for labeling purposes.
(2) Calculate fuel economy and CREE values for vehicle subconfigurations, configurations, base levels, and model types as described in §§ 600.206 and 600.208. Calculate fleet average values for fuel economy and CREE as described in § 600.510.
(3) Determine fuel economy values for labeling as described in § 600.210 using either the vehicle-specific 5-cycle method or the derived 5-cycle method as described in § 600.115.
(i) For vehicle-specific 5-cycle labels, the test vehicle (subconfiguration) data are adjusted to better represent in-use fuel economy and CO
2
emissions based on the vehicle-specific equations in § 600.114. Sections 600.207 and 600.209 describe how to use the “adjusted” city
and highway subconfiguration values to calculate adjusted values for the vehicle configuration, base level, and the model type. These “adjusted” city, highway, and combined fuel economy estimates and the combined CO
2
emissions for the model type are shown on fuel economy labels.
(ii) For derived 5-cycle labels, calculate “unadjusted” fuel economy and CO

CO

and carbon-related exhaust emissions calculations for hybrid electric vehicles.
Test hybrid electric vehicles as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011). For FTP testing, this generally involves emission sampling over four phases (bags) of the UDDS (cold-start, transient, warm-start, transient); however, these four phases may be combined into two phases (phases 1 + 2 and phases 3 + 4). Calculations for these sampling methods follow:
(1) If the 4-bag sampling method is used, manufacturers may use the equations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to determine city and highway CO
2
and carbon-related exhaust emissions values. The appropriate CO
2
emission input values for fuel economy labeling based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO
2
emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166. If this method is chosen, it must be used to determine both city and highway CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions. Optionally, the following calculations may be used, provided that they are used to determine both city and highway CO
2
and carbon-related exhaust emissions values:

2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions. The appropriate CO
2
emission input values for fuel economy labeling based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO
2
emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166. The following calculations

(3) For hybrid electric vehicles using the modified 5-cycle highway calculation in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the equation in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section applies except that the equation for Start CREE
75
will be replaced with one of the following:
(i) The equation for Start CREE
75
for hybrids tested according to the 4-bag FTP is:
Start CREE

§ 600.115-11
Criteria for determining the fuel economy label calculation method.
This section provides the criteria to determine if the derived 5-cycle method for determining fuel economy label values, as specified in § 600.210-08(a)(2) or (b)(2) or § 600.210-12(a)(2) or (b)(2), as
applicable, may be used to determine label values. Separate criteria apply to city and highway fuel economy for each test group. The provisions of this section are optional. If this option is not chosen, or if the criteria provided in this section are not met, fuel economy label values must be determined according to the vehicle-specific 5-cycle method specified in § 600.210-08(a)(1) or (b)(1) or § 600.210-12(a)(1) or (b)(1), as applicable. However, dedicated alternative-fuel vehicles (other than battery electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles), dual fuel vehicles when operating on the alternative fuel, MDPV
FE
, and vehicles imported by Independent Commercial Importers may use the derived 5-cycle method for determining fuel economy label values whether or not the criteria provided in this section are met. Manufacturers may alternatively account for this effect for battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (when operating in the charge-depleting mode) by multiplying 2-cycle fuel economy values by 0.7 and dividing 2-cycle CO
2
emission values by 0.7.
(a)
City fuel economy criterion.
(1) For each test group certified for emission compliance under § 86.1848 of this chapter, the FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests determined to be official under § 86.1835 of this chapter are used to calculate the vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy which is then compared to the derived 5-cycle city fuel economy, as follows:
(i) The vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy from the official FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests for the test group is determined according to the provisions of § 600.114-08(a) or (c) or § 600.114-12(a) or (c) and rounded to the nearest one tenth of a mile per gallon.
(ii) Using the same FTP data as used in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the corresponding derived 5-cycle city fuel economy is calculated according to the following equation:
ER06JY11.033
Where:
City Intercept = Intercept determined by the Administrator.
See
§ 600.210-08(a)(2)(iii) or § 600.210-12(a)(2)(iii).
City Slope = Slope determined by the Administrator.
See
§ 600.210-08(a)(2)(iii) or § 600.210-12(a)(2)(ii).
FTP FE = the FTP-based city fuel economy from the official test used for certification compliance, determined under § 600.113-08(a), rounded to the nearest tenth.
(2) The derived 5-cycle fuel economy value determined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section is multiplied by 0.96 and rounded to the nearest one tenth of a mile per gallon.
(3) If the vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy determined in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is greater than or equal to the value determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then the manufacturer may base the city fuel economy estimates for the model types covered by the test group on the derived 5-cycle method specified in § 600.210-08(a)(2) or (b)(2) or § 600.210-12(a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable.
(b)
Highway fuel economy criterion.
The determination for highway fuel economy depends upon the outcome of the determination for city fuel economy in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for each test group.
(1) If the city determination for a test group made in paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not allow the use of the derived 5-cycle method, then the highway fuel economy values for all model types represented by the test group are likewise not allowed to be determined using the derived 5-cycle method, and must be determined according to the vehicle-specific 5-cycle method specified in § 600.210-08(a)(1) or (b)(1) or § 600.210-12(a)(1) or (b)(1), as applicable.
(2) If the city determination made in paragraph (a)(3) of this section allows the use of the derived 5-cycle method, a separate determination is made for the highway fuel economy labeling method as follows:
(i) For each test group certified for emission compliance under § 86.1848 of this chapter, the FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests determined to be official under § 86.1835 of this chapter are used to calculate the vehicle-specific 5-cycle highway fuel economy, which is then compared to the derived 5-cycle highway fuel economy, as follows:
(A) The vehicle-specific 5-cycle highway fuel economy from the official FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests for the test group is determined according to the provisions of § 600.114-08(b)(1) or § 600.114-12(b)(1) and rounded to the nearest one tenth of a mile per gallon.
(B) Using the same HFET data as used in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the corresponding derived 5-cycle highway fuel economy is calculated using the following equation:
ER06JY11.034
Where:
Highway Intercept = Intercept determined by the Administrator. See § 600.210-08(a)(2)(iii) or § 600.210-12(a)(2)(iii).
Highway Slope = Slope determined by the Administrator. See § 600.210-08(a)(2)(iii) or § 600.210-12(a)(2)(iii).
HFET FE = the HFET-based highway fuel economy determined under § 600.113-08(b), rounded to the nearest tenth.
(ii) The derived 5-cycle highway fuel economy calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section is multiplied by 0.95 and rounded to the nearest one tenth of a mile per gallon.
(iii) (A) If the vehicle-specific 5-cycle highway fuel economy of the vehicle tested in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is greater than or equal to the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, then the manufacturer may base the highway fuel economy estimates for the model types covered by the test group on the derived 5-cycle method specified in § 600.210-08(a)(2) or (b)(2) or § 600.210-12(a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable.
(B) If the vehicle-specific 5-cycle highway fuel economy determined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is less than the value determined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer may determine the highway fuel economy for the model types covered by the test group on the modified 5-cycle equation specified in § 600.114-08(b)(2) or § 600.114-12(b)(2).
(c) The manufacturer will apply the criteria in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section to every test group for each model year.
(d) The tests used to make the evaluations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be the procedures for official test determinations under § 86.1835. Adjustments and/or substitutions to the official test data may be made with advance approval of the Administrator.
[76 FR 39547, July 6, 2011, as amended at 76 FR 57380, Sept. 15, 2011; 88 FR 4481, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 28204, Apr. 18, 2024]
§ 600.116-12
Special procedures related to electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles.
(a) Determine fuel economy values for electric vehicles as specified in §§ 600.210 and 600.311 using the procedures of SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011). Use the procedures of SAE J1634, Section 8, with the following clarifications and modifications for using this and other sections of SAE J1634:
(1) Vehicles that cannot complete the Multi-Cycle Range and Energy Consumption Test (MCT) because they are unable travel the distance required to complete the test with a fully charged battery, or they are unable to achieve
the maximum speed on either the UDDS or HFEDS (Highway Fuel Economy Drive Cycle also known as the HFET) cycle should seek Administrator approval to use the procedures outlined in SAE J1634 Section 7 Single Cycle Range and Energy Consumption Test (SCT).
(2) The MCT includes the following key-on soak times and key-off soak periods:
(i) As noted in SAE J1634 Section 8.3.4, a 15 second key-on pause is required between UDDS
1
and HFEDS
1
, and UDDS
3
and HFEDS
2
.
(ii) As noted in SAE J1634 Section 8.3.4, a 10-minute key-off soak period is required between HFEDS
1
and UDDS
2
, and HFEDS
2
and UDDS
4
.
(iii) A key-off soak period up to 30 minutes may be inserted between UDDS
2
and the first phase of the mid-test constant speed cycle, between UDDS
4
and the first phase of the end-of-test constant speed cycle, and between the end of the mid-test constant speed cycle and UDDS
3
. Start the next test segment immediately if there is no key-off soak between test segments.
(iv) If multiple phases are required during either the mid-test constant speed cycle or the end-of-test constant speed cycle there must be a 5-minute to 30-minute key-off soak period between each constant speed phase as noted in SAE J1634 Section 6.6.
(3) As noted in SAE J1634 Section 8.3.4, during all `key-off' soak periods, the key or power switch must be in the “off” position, the hood must be closed, the test cell fan(s) must be off, and the brake pedal not depressed. For vehicles which do not have a key or power switch the vehicle must be placed in the `mode' the manufacturer recommends when the vehicle is to be parked and the occupants exit the vehicle.
(4) Manufacturers may determine the mid-test constant speed cycle distance (d
M
) using their own methodology and good engineering judgment. Otherwise, either Method 1 or Method 2 described in Appendix A of SAE J1634 may be used to estimate the mid-test constant speed cycle distance (d
M
). The mid-test constant speed cycle distance calculation needs to be performed prior to beginning the test and should not use data from the test being performed. If Method 2 is used, multiply the result determined by the Method 2 equation by 0.8 to determine the mid-test constant speed cycle distance (d
M
).
(5) Divide the mid-test constant speed cycle distance (d
M
) by 65 mph to determine the total time required for the mid-test constant speed cycle. If the time required is one hour or less, the mid-test constant speed cycle can be performed with no key-off soak periods. If the time required is greater than one hour, the mid-test constant speed cycle must be separated into phases such that no phase exceeds more than one hour. At the conclusion of each mid-test constant speed phase, except at the conclusion of the mid-test constant speed cycle, perform a 5-minute to 30-minute key-off soak. A key-off soak period up to 30 minutes may be inserted between the end of the mid-test constant speed cycle and UDDS
3
.
(6) Using good engineering judgment determine the end-of-test constant speed cycle distance so that it does not exceed 20% of the total distance driven during the MCT as described in SAE J1634 Section 8.3.3.
(7) Divide the end-of-test constant speed cycle distance (d
E
) by 65 mph to determine the total time required for the end-of-test constant speed cycle. If the time required is one-hour or less the end-of-test constant speed cycle can be performed with no key-off soak periods. If the time required is greater than one-hour the end-of-test constant speed cycle must be separated into phases such that no phase exceeds more than one-hour. At the conclusion of each end-of-test constant speed phase, perform a 5-minute to 30-minute key-off soak.
(8) SAE J1634 Section 3.13 defines useable battery energy (UBE) as the total DC discharge energy (Edc
total
), measured in DC watt-hours for a full discharge test. The total DC discharge energy is the sum of all measured phases of a test inclusive of all drive cycle types. As key-off soak periods are not considered part of the test phase, the discharge energy that occurs during the key-off soak periods is not included in the useable battery energy.
(9) Recharging the vehicle's battery must start within three hours after the end of testing.
(10) At the request of a manufacturer, the Administrator may approve the use of an earlier version of SAE J1634 when a manufacturer is carrying over data for vehicles tested using a prior version of SAE J1634.
(11) All label values related to fuel economy, energy consumption, and range must be based on 5-cycle testing or on values adjusted to be equivalent to 5-cycle results. Prior to performing testing to generate a 5-cycle adjustment factor, manufacturers must request Administrator approval to use SAE J1634 Appendices B and C for determining a 5-cycle adjustment factor with the following modifications, clarifications, and attestations:
(i) Before model year 2025, prior to performing the 20 °F charge-depleting UDDS, the vehicle must soak for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 36 hours at a temperature of 20 °F. Prior to beginning the 12 to 36 hour cold soak at 20 °F the vehicle must be fully charged, the charging can take place at test laboratory ambient temperatures (68 to 86 °F) or at 20 °F. During the 12 to 36 hour cold soak period the vehicle may not be connected to a charger nor is the vehicle cabin or battery to be preconditioned during the 20 °F soak period.
(ii) Beginning with model year 2025, the 20 °F UDDS charge-depleting UDDS test will be replaced with a 20 °F UDDS test consisting of two UDDS cycles performed with a 10-minute key-off soak between the two UDDS cycles. The data from the two UDDS cycles will be used to calculate the five-cycle adjustment factor, instead of using the results from the entire charge-depleting data set. Manufacturers that have submitted and used the average data from 20 °F charge-depleting UDDS data sets will be required to revise their 5-cycle adjustment factor calculation and re-label vehicles using the data from the first two UDDS cycles only. Manufacturers, at their discretion, would also be allowed to re-run the 20 °F UDDS test with the battery charged to a state-of-charge (SoC) determined by the manufacturer. The battery does not need to be at 100% SoC before the 20 °F cold soak.
(iii) Manufacturers must submit a written attestation to the Administrator at the completion of testing with the following information:
(A) A statement noting the SoC level of the rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) prior to beginning the 20 °F cold soak for testing performed beginning with model year 2025.
(B) A statement confirming the vehicle was not charged or preconditioned during the 12 to 36 hour 20 °F soak period before starting the 20 °F UDDS cycle.
(C) A summary of all the 5-cycle test results and the calculations used to generate the 5-cycle adjustment factor, including all the 20 °F UDDS cycles, the distance travelled during each UDDS and the measured DC discharge energy during each UDDS phase. Beginning in model year 2025, the 20 °F UDDS test results will consist of only two UDDS cycles.
(D) Beginning in model year 2025, calculate City Fuel Economy using the following equation for
RunningFC
instead of the equation on Page 30 in Appendix C of SAE J1634:
ER24JA23.007
(E) A description of each test group and configuration which will use the 5-cycle adjustment factor, including the battery capacity of the vehicle used to generate the 5-cycle adjustment factor
and the battery capacity of all the configurations to which it will be applied.
(iv) At the conclusion of the manufacturers testing and after receiving the attestations from the manufacturer regarding the performance of the 20 °F UDDS test processes, the 5-cycle test results, and the summary of vehicles to which the manufacturer proposes applying the 5-cycle adjustment factor, the Administrator will review the submittals and inform the manufacturer in writing if the Administrator concurs with the manufacturer's proposal. If not, the Administrator will describe the rationale to the manufacturer for not approving their request.
(b) Determine performance values for hybrid electric vehicles that have no plug-in capability as specified in §§ 600.210 and 600.311 using the procedures for charge-sustaining operation from SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011). We may approve alternate measurement procedures with respect to these vehicles if that is necessary or appropriate for meeting the objectives of this part. For example, we may approve alternate Net Energy Change/Fuel Ratio tolerances for charge-sustaining operation as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(c) Determine performance values for hybrid electric vehicles that have plug-in capability as specified in §§ 600.210 and 600.311 using the procedures of SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011), with the following clarifications and modifications:
(1) To determine CREE values to demonstrate compliance with GHG standards, calculate composite values representing combined operation during charge-depleting and charge-sustaining operation using the following utility factors, except as otherwise specified in this paragraph (c):

Calculate this value by dividing the equivalent all-electric range determined from the equation in § 86.1866-12(b)(2)(ii) by the corresponding measured Watt-hours of energy consumed; apply the appropriate petroleum-equivalence factor from 10 CFR 474.3 to convert Watt-hours to gallons equivalent. Note that if vehicles use no gasoline during charge-depleting operation, MPGe
elec
is the same as the charge-depleting fuel economy specified in SAE J1711.
(iii) For 2016 and later model year dual fueled automobiles, you may determine fuel economy based on the following equation, separately for city and highway driving:

# Equation 3 to Paragraph (c)(2)(iii)
ER18AP24.071
Where:
UF
= The appropriate utility factor for city or highway driving specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for model year 2030 and earlier vehicles.
(3) To determine fuel economy and CO

emission values for labeling purposes, calculate composite values representing combined operation during charge-depleting and charge-sustaining operation using the following utility factors except as specified in this paragraph (c):

(4) You may calculate performance values under paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section by combining phases during FTP testing. For example, you may treat the first 7.45 miles as a single phase by adding the individual utility factors for that portion of driving and assigning emission levels to the combined phase. Do this consistently throughout a test run.
(5) Instead of the utility factors specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, calculate utility factors using the following equation for vehicles whose maximum speed is less than the maximum speed specified in the driving schedule, where the vehicle's maximum speed is determined, to the nearest 0.1 mph, from observing the highest speed over the first duty cycle (FTP, HFET, etc.):

n
= the number of test phases (or bag measurements) before the vehicle reaches the end-of-test criterion.
(6) Determine End-of-Test as follows:
(i) Base End-of-Test on a 2 percent State of Charge as specified in Section 3.5.1 of SAE J1711.
(ii) Base End-of-Test on a 1 percent Net Energy Change/Fuel Ratio as specified in Section 3.5.2 of SAE J1711.
(iii) For charge-sustaining tests, we may approve alternate Net Energy Change/Fuel Ratio tolerances as specified in Appendix C of SAE J1711 to correct final fuel economy values, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions. For charge-sustaining tests, do not use alternate Net Energy Change/Fuel Ratio tolerances to correct emissions of criteria pollutants. Additionally, if we approve an alternate End-of-Test criterion or Net Energy Change/Fuel Ratio tolerances for a specific vehicle, we may use the alternate criterion or tolerances for any testing we conduct on that vehicle.
(7) Use the vehicle's Actual Charge-Depleting Range, Rcda, as specified in Section 7.1.4 of SAE J1711 for evaluating the end-of-test criterion.
(8) Measure and record AC watt-hours throughout the recharging procedure. Position the measurement appropriately to account for any losses in the charging system.
(9) We may approve alternate measurement procedures with respect to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles if they are necessary or appropriate for meeting the objectives of this part.
(10) The utility factors described in this paragraph (c) and in § 600.510 are derived from equations in SAE J2841. You may alternatively calculate utility factors from the corresponding equations in SAE J2841 as follows:
(i) Calculate utility factors for labeling directly from the equation in SAE J2841 Section 6.2 using the Table 2 MDIUF Fit Coefficients (C1 through C10) and a normalized distance (norm_dist) of 399 miles.
(ii) Calculate utility factors for fuel economy standards from the equation in SAE J2841 Section 6.2 using the Table 5 Fit Coefficients for city/Hwy Specific FUF curves weighted 55 percent city, 45 percent highway and a normalized distance (norm_dist) of 399 miles.
(iii) Starting in model year 2031, calculate utility factors for GHG compliance with emission standards from the equation in SAE J2841 Section 6.2 using the Table 2 FUF Fit Coefficients (C1 through C6) and a normalized distance
(norm_dist) of 583 miles. For model year 2026 and earlier, calculate utility factors for compliance with GHG emission standards as described in paragraph (c)(10)(ii) of this section.
(11) The following methodology is used to determine the usable battery energy (UBE) for a PHEV using data obtained during either the UDDS Full Charge Test (FCT) or the HFET FCT as described in SAE J1711:
(i) Perform the measurements described in SAE J1711 Section 5.1.3.d. Record initial and final SOC of the RESS for each cycle in the FCT.
(ii) Perform the measurements described in SAE J1711 Section 5.1.3.c. Continuously measure the voltage of the RESS throughout the entire cycle, or record initial and final voltage measurements of the RESS for each test cycle.
(iii) Determine average voltage of the RESS during each FCT cycle by averaging the results of the continuous voltage measurement or by determining the average of the initial and final voltage measurement.
(iv) Determine the DC discharge energy for each cycle of the FCT by multiplying the change in SOC of each cycle by the average voltage for the cycle.
(v) Instead of independently measuring current and voltage and calculating the resulting DC discharge energy, you may use a DC wideband Watt-hour meter (power analyzer) to directly measure the DC discharge energy of the RESS during each cycle of the FCT. The meter used for this measurement must meet the requirements in SAE J1711 Section 4.4.
(vi) After completing the FCT, determine the cycles comprising the Charge-Depleting Cycle Range (Rcdc) as described in SAE J1711 Section 3.1.14. Charge-sustaining cycles are not included in the Rcdc. Rcdc includes any number of transitional cycles where the vehicle may have operated in both charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes.
(vii) Determine the UBE of the PHEV by summing the measured DC discharge energy for each cycle comprising Rcdc. Following the charge-depleting cycles and during the transition to charge-sustaining operation, one or more of the transition cycles may result in negative DC discharge energy measurements that result from the vehicle charging and not discharging the RESS. Include these negative discharge results in the summation.
(d)
Determining the proportion of recovered energy for hybrid electric vehicles.
Testing of hybrid electric vehicles under this part may include a determination of the proportion of energy recovered over the FTP relative to the total available braking energy required over the FTP. This determination is required for pickup trucks accruing credits for implementation of hybrid technology under § 86.1870-12, and requires the measurement of electrical current (in amps) flowing into the hybrid system battery for the duration of the test. Hybrid electric vehicles are tested for fuel economy and GHG emissions using the 4-bag FTP as required by § 600.114(c). Alternative measurement and calculation methods may be used with prior EPA approval.
(1) Calculate the theoretical maximum amount of energy that could be recovered by a hybrid electric vehicle over the FTP test cycle, where the test cycle time and velocity points are expressed at 10 Hz, and the velocity (miles/hour) is expressed to the nearest 0.01 miles/hour, as follows:
(i) For each time point in the 10 Hz test cycle (
i.e.
, at each 0.1 seconds):
(A) Determine the road load power in kilowatts using the following equation:
ER15OC12.056
Where:
P
roadload
is the road load power in kilowatts, where road load is negative because it always represents a deceleration (
i.e.
, resistive) force on the vehicle;
A, B, and C are the vehicle-specific dynamometer road load coefficients in lb-force, lb-force/mph, and lb-force/mph
2
, respectively;
V
mph
= velocity in miles/hour, expressed to the nearest 0.01 miles/hour;
0.44704 converts speed from miles/hour to meters/second;
4.448 converts pound force to Newtons; and
1,000 converts power from Watts to kilowatts.
(B) Determine the applied deceleration power at each sampling point in time, t, in kilowatts, using the following equation. Positive values indicate acceleration and negative values indicate deceleration.
ER15OC12.057
Where:
ETW = the vehicle Equivalent Test Weight (lbs);
V
t
= velocity in miles/hour, rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/hour, at each sampling point;
V
t-1
= the velocity in miles/hour at the previous time point in the 10 Hz speed vs. time table, rounded to the nearest 0.01 miles/hour;
0.1 represents the time in seconds between each successive velocity data point;
0.44704 converts speed from miles/hour to meters/second;
2.205 converts weight from pounds to kilograms; and
1,000 converts power from Watts to kilowatts.
(C) Determine braking power in kilowatts using the following equation. Note that during braking events,
P
brake
, P
accel
, and
P
roadload
will all be negative (
i.e.,
resistive) forces on the vehicle.
P
brake
=
P
accel
−
P
roadload
Where:
P
accel
= the value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section;
P
roadload
= the value determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section; and
P
brake
= 0 if
P
accel
is greater than or equal to
P
roadload
.
(ii) The total maximum braking energy (
E
brake
) that could theoretically be recovered is equal to the absolute value of the sum of all the values of
P
brake
determined in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section, divided by 36000 (to convert 10 Hz data to hours) and rounded to the nearest 0.01 kilowatt-hours.
(ii) The total maximum braking energy (E
brake
) that could theoretically be recovered is equal to the absolute value of the sum of all the values of P
brake
determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, divided by 36000 (to convert 10 Hz data to hours) and rounded to the nearest 0.01 kilowatt hours.
(2) Calculate the actual amount of energy recovered (E
rec
) by a hybrid electric vehicle when tested on the FTP according to the provisions of this part, as follows:
(i) Measure the electrical current in Amps to and from the hybrid electric vehicle battery during the FTP. Measurements should be made directly upstream of the battery at a 10 Hz sampling rate.
(ii) At each sampling point where current is flowing into the battery, calculate the energy flowing into the battery, in Watt-hours, as follows:
ER25OC16.045
Where:
E
t
= the energy flowing into the battery, in Watt-hours, at time t in the test;
I
t
= the electrical current, in Amps, at time
t
in the test; and
V
nominal
= the nominal voltage of the hybrid battery system determined according to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(iii) The total energy recovered (E
rec
) is the absolute value of the sum of all values of E
t
that represent current flowing into the battery, divided by 1000 (to convert Watt-hours to kilowatt-hours).
(3) The percent of braking energy recovered by a hybrid system relative to the total available energy is determined by the following equation, rounded to the nearest one percent:
ER25OC16.046
Where:
E
rec
= The actual total energy recovered, in kilowatt-hours, as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and
E
brake
= The theoretical maximum amount of energy, in kilowatt-hours, that could be recovered by a hybrid electric vehicle over the FTP test cycle, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(4)(i) Determination nominal voltage (V
nominal
) using the following equation:
ER15OC12.061
Where:
V
S
is the battery voltage measured at the start of the FTP test, where the measurement is made after the key-on event but not later than 10 seconds after the key-on event; and
V
F
is the battery voltage measured at the conclusion of the FTP test, where the measurement is made before the key-off event but not earlier than 10 seconds prior to the key-off event.
(ii) If the absolute value of the measured current to and from the battery during the measurement of either V
S
or V
F
exceeds three percent of the maximum absolute value of the current measured over the FTP, then that V
S
or V
F
value is not valid. If no valid voltage measurement can be made using this method, the manufacturer must develop an alternative method of determining nominal voltage. The alternative must be developed using good engineering judgment and is subject to EPA approval.

§ 600.117
Interim provisions.
(a) The following provisions apply instead of other provisions specified in this part through model year 2026:
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section, manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with greenhouse gas emission standards and determine fuel economy values using E0 gasoline test fuel as specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1), regardless of any testing with E10 test fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) Manufacturers may demonstrate that vehicles comply with emission standards for criteria pollutants as specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, during fuel economy measurements using the E0 gasoline test fuel specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1), as long as this
test fuel is used in fuel economy testing for all applicable duty cycles specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S. If a vehicle fails to meet an emission standard for a criteria pollutant using the E0 gasoline test fuel specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1), the manufacturer must retest the vehicle using the E10 test fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) (or the equivalent LEV III test fuel for California) to demonstrate compliance with all applicable emission standards over that test cycle.
(3) If a manufacturer demonstrates compliance with emission standards for criteria pollutants over all five test cycles using the E10 test fuel specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) (or the equivalent LEV III test fuel for California), the manufacturer may use test data with the same test fuel to determine whether a test group meets the criteria described in § 600.115 for derived 5-cycle testing for fuel economy labeling. Such vehicles may be tested over the FTP and HFET cycles with the E0 gasoline test fuel specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1) under this paragraph (a)(3); the vehicles must meet the emission standards for criteria pollutants over those test cycles as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(4) Manufacturers may perform testing with the appropriate gasoline test fuels specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1), 40 CFR 86.213(a)(2), and in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) to evaluate whether their vehicles meet the criteria for derived 5-cycle testing under § 600.115. All five tests must use test fuel with the same nominal ethanol concentration.
(5) For IUVP testing under 40 CFR 86.1845, manufacturers may demonstrate compliance with greenhouse gas emission standards using a test fuel meeting specifications for demonstrating compliance with emission standards for criteria pollutants.
(6) Manufacturers may alternatively demonstrate compliance with greenhouse gas emission standards and determine fuel economy values using E10 gasoline test fuel as specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b). However, manufacturers must then multiply measured CO
2
results by 1.0166 and round to the nearest 0.01 g/mile and calculate fuel economy using the equations appropriate equation for testing with E10 test fuel.
(7) If a vehicle uses an E10 test fuel for evaporative emission testing and E0 is the applicable test fuel for exhaust emission testing, exhaust measurement and reporting requirements apply over the course of the evaporative emission test, but the vehicle need not meet the exhaust emission standards during the evaporative emission test run.
(b) Manufacturers may certify model year 2027 through 2029 vehicles to greenhouse gas emission standards using data with E0 test fuel from testing for earlier model years, subject to the carryover provisions of 40 CFR 86.1839. In the case of the fleet average CO
2
standard, manufacturers must divide the measured CO
2
results by 1.0166 and round to the nearest 0.01 g/mile.
(c) Manufacturers may perform testing under § 600.115-11 using E0 gasoline test fuel as specified in 40 CFR 86.113-04(a)(1) or E10 test fuel as specified in 40 CFR 1065.710(b) until EPA publishes guidance under § 600.210-12(a)(2)(iv) describing when and how to apply 5-cycle adjustment factors based on testing with the E10 test fuel.

# Subpart C—Procedures for Calculating Fuel Economy and Carbon-Related Exhaust Emission Values
§ 600.206-12
Calculation and use of FTP-based and HFET-based fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values for vehicle configurations.
(a) Fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions values determined for each vehicle under § 600.113-08(a) and (b) and as approved in § 600.008(c), are used to determine FTP-based city, HFET-based highway, and combined FTP/Highway-based fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values for each vehicle configuration for which data are available. Note that fuel economy for some alternative fuel vehicles may mean miles per gasoline gallon equivalent and/or miles per unit of fuel consumed. For example, electric vehicles will determine miles per kilowatt-hour in addition to miles per gasoline gallon equivalent, and fuel cell vehicles
will determine miles per kilogram of hydrogen.
(1) If only one set of FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy values is accepted for a subconfiguration at which a vehicle configuration was tested, these values, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, comprise the city and highway fuel economy values for that subconfiguration. If only one set of FTP-based city and HFET-based highway CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values is accepted for a subconfiguration at which a vehicle configuration was tested, these values, rounded to the nearest gram per mile, comprise the city and highway CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values for that subconfiguration. The appropriate CO
2
values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO
2
emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166.
(2) If more than one set of FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy and/or carbon-related exhaust emission values are accepted for a vehicle configuration:
(i) All data shall be grouped according to the subconfiguration for which the data were generated using sales projections supplied in accordance with § 600.208-12(a)(3).
(ii) Within each group of data, all fuel economy values are harmonically averaged and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 of a mile per gallon and all CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values are arithmetically averaged and rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile in order to determine FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values for each subconfiguration at which the vehicle configuration was tested. The appropriate CO
2
values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are the measured tailpipe CO
2
emissions for the test cycle multiplied by 1.0166.
(iii) All FTP-based city fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values and all HFET-based highway fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values calculated in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are (separately for city and highway) averaged in proportion to the sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) within the vehicle configuration (as provided to the Administrator by the manufacturer) of vehicles of each tested subconfiguration. Fuel economy values shall be harmonically averaged, and CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values shall be arithmetically averaged. The resultant fuel economy values, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon, are the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy values for the vehicle configuration. The resultant CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values, rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile, are the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values for the vehicle configuration. Note that the appropriate vehicle subconfiguration CO
2
values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are adjusted as described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)(i) For the purpose of determining average fuel economy under § 600.510, the combined fuel economy value for a vehicle configuration is calculated by harmonically averaging the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy values, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon. A sample of this calculation appears in appendix II to this part.
(ii) For the purpose of determining average carbon-related exhaust emissions under § 600.510, the combined carbon-related exhaust emission value for a vehicle configuration is calculated by arithmetically averaging the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway carbon-related exhaust emission values, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and rounded to the nearest tenth of gram per mile.
(4) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, shall be used to calculate two separate sets of FTP-based city, HFET-based highway, and combined values for fuel
economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each configuration.
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel.
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel.
(b) If only one equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value exists for an electric vehicle configuration, that value, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, will comprise the petroleum-based fuel economy for that configuration.
(c) If more than one equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value exists for an electric vehicle configuration, all values for that vehicle configuration are harmonically averaged and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon for that configuration.
[76 FR 39551, July 6, 2011, as amended at 89 FR 28207, Apr. 18, 2024]
§ 600.207-12
Calculation and use of vehicle-specific 5-cycle-based fuel economy and CO
2
emission values for vehicle configurations.
(a) Fuel economy and CO
2
emission values determined for each vehicle under § 600.114 and as approved in § 600.008(c), are used to determine vehicle-specific 5-cycle city and highway fuel economy and CO
2
emission values for each vehicle configuration for which data are available.
(1) If only one set of 5-cycle city and highway fuel economy and CO
2
emission values is accepted for a vehicle configuration, these values, where fuel economy is rounded to the nearest 0.0001 of a mile per gallon and the CO
2
emission value in grams per mile is rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile, comprise the city and highway fuel economy and CO
2

Calculation of FTP-based and HFET-based fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for a model type.
(a) Fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for a base level are calculated from vehicle configuration fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions as determined in § 600.206-12(a), (b), or (c) as applicable, for low-altitude tests.
(1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California and in section 177 states are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from those intended for sale in other states, she will calculate fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each base level for vehicles intended for sale in California and in section 177 states and for each base level for vehicles intended for sale in the rest of the states.
(2) In order to highlight the fuel efficiency, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions of certain designs otherwise included within a model type, a manufacturer may wish to subdivide a model type into one or more additional model types. This is accomplished by separating subconfigurations from an existing base level and placing them into a new base level. The new base level is identical to the existing base level except that it shall be considered, for the purposes of this paragraph, as containing a new basic engine. The manufacturer will be permitted to designate such new basic engines and base level(s) if:
(i) Each additional model type resulting from division of another model type has a unique car line name and that name appears on the label and on the vehicle bearing that label;
(ii) The subconfigurations included in the new base levels are not included in any other base level which differs only by basic engine (
i.e.,
they are not included in the calculation of the original base level fuel economy values); and
(iii) All subconfigurations within the new base level are represented by test data in accordance with § 600.010(c)(1)(iii).
(3) The manufacturer shall supply total model year sales projections for each car line/vehicle subconfiguration combination.
(i) Sales projections must be supplied separately for each car line-vehicle subconfiguration intended for sale in California and each car line/vehicle subconfiguration intended for sale in the rest of the states if required by the Administrator under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii) Manufacturers shall update sales projections at the time any model type value is calculated for a label value.

(4) Vehicle configuration fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions, as determined in
§ 600.206-12(a), (b) or (c), as applicable, are grouped according to base level.
(i) If only one vehicle configuration within a base level has been tested, the fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from that vehicle configuration will constitute the fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for that base level. Note that the appropriate vehicle subconfiguration CO
2
values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are adjusted as referenced in § 600.206-12(a)(2)(iii); those values are used to calculate the base level CO
2
values in this paragraph (a)(4)(i).
(ii) If more than one vehicle configuration within a base level has been tested, the vehicle configuration fuel economy values are harmonically averaged in proportion to the respective sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) of each vehicle configuration and the resultant fuel economy value rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon; and the vehicle configuration CO
2
emissions and carbon-related exhaust emissions are arithmetically averaged in proportion to the respective sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) of each vehicle configuration and the resultant carbon-related exhaust emission value rounded to the nearest tenth of a gram per mile. Note that the appropriate vehicle subconfiguration CO
2
values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are adjusted as referenced in § 600.206-12(a)(2)(iii); those values are used to calculate the base level CO
2
values in this paragraph (a)(4)(ii).
(5) The procedure specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section will be repeated for each base level, thus establishing city, highway, and combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each base level.

2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each base level.
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel.
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel.
(b) For each model type, as determined by the Administrator, a city, highway, and combined fuel economy value, CO
2
emission value, and a carbon-related exhaust emission value will be calculated by using the projected sales and values for fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each base level within the model type. Separate model type calculations will be done based on the vehicle configuration fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions as determined in § 600.206-12(a), (b) or (c), as applicable.
(1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California and in section 177 states are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions from those intended for sale in other states, he or she will calculate values for fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each model type for vehicles intended for sale in California and in section 177 states and for each model type for vehicles intended for sale in the rest of the states.
(2) The sales fraction for each base level is calculated by dividing the projected sales of the base level within the model type by the projected sales of the model type and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.0001.
(3)(i) The FTP-based city fuel economy values of the model type (calculated to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) are determined by dividing one by a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a base level and which is a fraction determined by dividing:
(A) The sales fraction of a base level; by
(B) The FTP-based city fuel economy value for the respective base level.
(ii) The FTP-based city carbon-related exhaust emission value of the
model type (calculated to the nearest gram per mile) are determined by a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a base level and which is a product determined by multiplying:
(A) The sales fraction of a base level; by

Calculation of fuel economy and CO
2
emission values for labeling.
(a)
General labels.
Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, fuel economy and CO
2
emissions for general labels may be determined by one of two methods. The first is based on vehicle-specific model-type 5-cycle data as determined in § 600.209-12(b). This method is available for all vehicles and is required for vehicles that do not qualify for the second method as described in § 600.115 (other than electric vehicles). The second method, the derived 5-cycle method, determines fuel economy and CO
2
emissions values from the FTP and HFET tests using equations that are derived from vehicle-specific 5-cycle model type data, as determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may voluntarily lower fuel economy (MPG) values and raise CO
2
values if they determine that the label values from any method are not representative of the in-use fuel economy and CO
2
emissions for that model type, but only if the manufacturer changes both the MPG values and the CO
2
value and revises any other affected label value accordingly for a model type (including but not limited to the fuel economy 1-10 rating, greenhouse gas 1-10 rating, annual fuel cost, 5-year fuel cost information). Similarly, for any electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, manufacturers may voluntarily lower the fuel economy (MPGe) and raise the energy consumption (kW-hr/100 mile) values if they determine that the label values are not representative of the in-use fuel economy, energy consumption, and CO
2
emissions for that model type, but only if the manufacturer changes both the MPGe and the energy consumption value and revises any other affected label value accordingly for a model type. Manufacturers may voluntarily lower the value for electric driving range if they determine that the label values are not representative of the in-use electric driving range.
(1)
Vehicle-specific 5-cycle labels.
The city and highway model type fuel economy determined in § 600.209-12(b), rounded to the nearest mpg, and the city and highway model type CO

Where:
City Intercept = Intercept determined by the Administrator based on historic vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy data.
City Slope = Slope determined by the Administrator based on historic vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy data.
MT FTP FE = the model type FTP-based city fuel economy determined under § 600.208-12(b), rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg.

MT FTP CO
2
= the model type FTP-based city CO
2
emissions determined under § 600.208-12(b), rounded to the nearest 0.1 grams per mile. Note that the appropriate MT FTP CO
2
input values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are adjusted as referenced in § 600.208-12(b)(3)(iii).
(ii)(A) For each model type, determine the derived five-cycle highway fuel economy using the equation below and coefficients determined by the Administrator:
ER06JY11.037
Where:

2
=

·
A
+
Highway Slope
·

Where:

MT HFET CO
2
= the model type highway CO
2
emissions determined under § 600.208-12(b), rounded to the nearest 0.1 grams per mile. Note that the appropriate the MT HFET CO
2
input values for fuel economy labels based on testing with E10 test fuel are adjusted as referenced in § 600.208-12(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(4).
(iii) Unless and until superseded by written guidance from the Administrator, the following intercepts and
slopes shall be used in the equations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
City Intercept = 0.004091.
City Slope = 1.1601.
Highway Intercept = 0.003191.
Highway Slope = 1.2945.
(iv) The Administrator will periodically update the slopes and intercepts through guidance and will determine the model year that the new coefficients must take effect. The Administrator will issue guidance no later than six months prior to the earliest starting date of the effective model year (e.g., for 2011 models, the earliest start of the model year is January 2, 2010, so guidance would be issued by July 1, 2009.) Until otherwise instructed by written guidance from the Administrator, manufacturers must use the coefficients that are currently in effect.

2
emissions label values for dual fuel vehicles.
(i)(A) City and Highway fuel economy label values for dual fuel alcohol-based and natural gas vehicles when using the alternate fuel are separately determined by the following calculation:

(4)
General alternate fuel economy and CO
2
emissions label values for electric vehicles.
Determine FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy label values for electric vehicles as described in § 600.116. Convert W-hour/mile results to miles per kW-hr and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent. CO

2
emissions label values for fuel cell vehicles.
Determine FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy label values for fuel cell vehicles using procedures specified by the Administrator. Convert kilograms of hydrogen/mile results to miles per kilogram of hydrogen and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent. CO

emissions from fuel cell vehicles are assumed to be zero.
(b)
Specific labels.
Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, fuel economy and CO
2
emissions for specific labels may be determined by one of two methods. The first is based on vehicle-specific configuration 5-cycle data as determined in § 600.207. This method is available for all vehicles and is required for vehicles that do not qualify for the second method as described in § 600.115 (other than electric vehicles). The second method, the derived 5-cycle method, determines fuel economy and CO
2
emissions values from the FTP and HFET tests using equations that are derived from vehicle-specific 5-cycle configuration data, as determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may voluntarily lower fuel economy values and raise CO

(c)
Calculating combined fuel economy.
(1) For the purposes of calculating the combined fuel economy for a model type, to be used in displaying on the label and for determining annual fuel costs under subpart D of this part, the manufacturer shall use one of the following procedures:
(i) For gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, and for dual fuel automobiles that can operate on gasoline or diesel fuel, harmonically average the unrounded city and highway fuel economy values, determined in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section and (b)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. Round the result to the nearest whole mpg. (An example of this calculation procedure appears in Appendix II of this part).
(ii) For alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles operated on the alternate fuel, harmonically average the unrounded city and highway values from the tests performed using the alternative fuel as determined in paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. Round the result to the nearest whole mpg.
(iii) For electric vehicles, calculate the combined fuel economy, in miles per kW-hr and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent, by harmonically averaging the unrounded city and highway values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. Round miles per kW-hr to the nearest 0.001 and round miles per gasoline gallon equivalent to the nearest whole number.
(iv) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate a combined fuel economy value, in miles per gasoline gallon equivalent as follows:
(A) Determine city and highway fuel economy values for vehicle operation after the battery has been fully discharged (“gas only operation” or “charge-sustaining mode”) as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(B) Determine city and highway fuel economy values for vehicle operation starting with a full battery charge (“all-electric operation” or “gas plus electric operation”, as appropriate, or “charge-depleting mode”) as described in § 600.116. For battery energy, convert W-hour/mile results to miles per gasoline gallon equivalent or miles per diesel gallon equivalent, as applicable. Note that you must also express battery-based fuel economy values in miles per kW-hr for calculating annual fuel cost as described in § 600.311.
(C) Calculate a composite city fuel economy value and a composite highway fuel economy value by combining the separate results for battery and engine operation using the procedures described in § 600.116). Apply the derived 5-cycle adjustment to these composite values. Use these values to calculate the vehicle's combined fuel economy as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(v) For fuel cell vehicles, calculate the combined fuel economy, in miles per kilogram and miles per gasoline gallon equivalent, by harmonically averaging the unrounded city and highway values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively. Round miles per kilogram to the nearest whole number and round
miles per gasoline gallon equivalent to the nearest whole number.
(2) For the purposes of calculating the combined CO
2
emissions value for a model type, to be used in displaying on the label under subpart D of this part, the manufacturer shall:
(i) For gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, and for dual fuel automobiles that can operate on gasoline or diesel fuel, arithmetically average the unrounded city and highway values, determined in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section and (b)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and round to the nearest whole gram per mile; or
(ii) For alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles operated on the alternate fuel, arithmetically average the unrounded city and highway CO
2
emission values from the tests performed using the alternative fuel as determined in paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and round to the nearest whole gram per mile.
(iii) CO
2
label information is based on tailpipe emissions only, so CO
2
emissions from electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles are assumed to be zero.
(iv) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate combined CO
2
emissions as follows:
(A) Determine city and highway CO
2
emission rates for vehicle operation after the battery has been fully discharged (“gas only operation” or “charge-sustaining mode”) as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(B) Determine city and highway CO
2
emission rates for vehicle operation starting with a full battery charge (“all-electric operation” or “gas plus electric operation”, as appropriate, or “charge-depleting mode”) as described in § 600.116. Note that CO
2
label information is based on tailpipe emissions only, so CO
2
emissions from electricity are assumed to be zero.
(C) Calculate a composite city CO
2
emission rate and a composite highway CO
2
emission rate by combining the separate results for battery and engine operation using the procedures described in § 600.116. Use these values to calculate the vehicle's combined CO
2
emissions as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(d)
Calculating combined fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and driving range.
(1) If the criteria in § 600.115-11(a) are met for a model type, both the city and highway fuel economy and CO
2
emissions values must be determined using the vehicle-specific 5-cycle method. If the criteria in § 600.115-11(b) are met for a model type, the city fuel economy and CO
2
emissions values may be determined using either method, but the highway fuel economy and CO
2
emissions values must be determined using the vehicle-specific 5-cycle method (or modified 5-cycle method as allowed under § 600.114-12(b)(2)).
(2) If the criteria in § 600.115 are not met for a model type, the city and highway fuel economy and CO
2
emission label values must be determined by using the same method, either the derived 5-cycle or vehicle-specific 5-cycle.
(3) Manufacturers may use one of the following methods to determine 5-cycle values for fuel economy, CO
2
emissions, and driving range for electric vehicles:
(i) Generate 5-cycle data as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the procedures of SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011) with amendments and revisions as described in § 600.116-12(a).
(ii) Multiply 2-cycle fuel economy values and driving range by 0.7 and divide 2-cycle CO
2
emission values by 0.7.
(iii) Manufacturers may ask the Administrator to approve adjustment factors for deriving 5-cycle fuel economy results from 2-cycle test data based on operating data from their in-use vehicles. Such data should be collected from multiple vehicles with different drivers over a range of representative driving routes and conditions. The Administrator may approve such an adjustment factor for any of the manufacturer's vehicle models that are properly represented by the collected data.
(e)
Fuel economy values and other information for advanced technology vehicles.
(1) The Administrator may prescribe an alternative method of determining the city and highway model type fuel economy and CO
2
emission values for general, unique or specific fuel economy labels other than those
set forth in this subpart C for advanced technology vehicles including, but not limited to fuel cell vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles using hydraulic energy storage, and vehicles equipped with hydrogen internal combustion engines.
(2) For advanced technology vehicles, the Administrator may prescribe special methods for determining information other than fuel economy that is required to be displayed on fuel economy labels as specified in § 600.302-12(e).
(f)
Sample calculations.
An example of the calculation required in this subpart is in Appendix III of this part.

§ 600.311-12
Determination of values for fuel economy labels.
(a)
Fuel economy.
Determine city and highway fuel economy values as described in § 600.210-12(a) and (b). Determine combined fuel economy values as described in § 600.210-12(c). Note that the label for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles requires separate values for combined fuel economy for vehicle operation before and after the vehicle's battery is fully discharged; we generally refer to these modes as “Blended Electric + Gas” (or “Electric Only”, as applicable) and “Gas only”.
(b)
CO
2
emission rate
. Determine the engine-related CO
2
emission rate as described in § 600.210-12(d).
(c)
Fuel consumption rate.
Calculate the fuel consumption rate as follows:
(1) For vehicles with engines that are not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in gallons per 100 miles (or gasoline gallon equivalent per 100 miles for fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel) with the following formula, rounded to the first decimal place:
Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The value for combined fuel economy from § 600.210-12(c), rounded to the nearest whole mpg.
(2) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate two separate fuel consumption rates as follows:
(i) Calculate the fuel consumption rate based on engine operation after the battery is fully discharged as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii) Calculate the fuel consumption rate during operation before the battery is fully discharged in kW-hours per 100 miles as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011), as described in § 600.116.
(3) For electric vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in kW-hours per 100 miles with the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole number:
Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this section, in miles per kW-hour.
(4) For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in kilograms of hydrogen per 100 miles with the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole number:
Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this section, in miles per kilogram of hydrogen.
(d)
Fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings.
Determine a vehicle's fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings as follows:
(1) For gasoline-fueled vehicles that are not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (including flexible fuel vehicles that operate on gasoline), establish a single rating based only on the vehicle's combined fuel economy from paragraph (a) of this section. For all other vehicles, establish a fuel economy rating based on the vehicle's combined fuel economy and establish a separate greenhouse gas rating based on combined CO
2
emission rates from paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) We will establish the fuel economy rating based on fuel consumption values specified in paragraph (c) of this section. We will establish the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings based on the fuel consumption corresponding to the projected achieved Corporate Average Fuel Economy level for the applicable model year. This is intended to prevent below-average vehicles from getting an above-average fuel economy rating for the label. We will establish the remaining cutpoints based on a statistical evaluation of available information from the certification database for all model types. Specifically, the mean value plus two standard deviations will define the point between the 1 and 2 ratings. The mean value minus two standard deviations will define the point between the 9 and 10 ratings. The 1 rating will apply for any vehicle with higher fuel consumption rates than the 2 rating; similarly, the 10 rating will apply for any vehicle with lower fuel consumption rates than the 9 rating. We will calculate range values for the remaining intermediate ratings by dividing the range into equal intervals. We will convert the resulting range intervals to equivalent miles-per-gallon values. We will define the greenhouse gas ratings by converting the values from the fuel economy rating intervals to equivalent CO
2
emission rates using the conventional conversion factor for gasoline (8887 g CO
2
per gallon of consumed fuel).
(e)
Annual fuel cost.
Calculate annual fuel costs as follows:
(1) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, calculate the total annual fuel cost with the following formula, rounded to nearest $50:
Annual Fuel Cost = Fuel Price/MPG × Average Annual Miles
Where:
Fuel Price = The estimated fuel price provided by EPA for the type of fuel required for the vehicle. The units are dollars per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel, dollars per gasoline gallon equivalent for natural gas, dollars per kW-hr for plug-in electricity, and dollars per kilogram of hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this section. The units are miles per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel, miles per gasoline gallon equivalent for natural gas, miles per kW-hr for plug-in electricity, and miles per kilogram of hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
Average Annual Miles = The estimated annual mileage figure provided by EPA, in miles.
(2) For dual fuel vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles, disregard operation on the alternative fuel.
(3) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate annual fuel cost as described in this paragraph (e)(3). This description applies for vehicles whose engine starts only after the battery is fully discharged. Use good engineering judgment to extrapolate this for calculating annual fuel cost for vehicles that use combined power from the battery and the engine before the battery is fully discharged. Calculate annual fuel cost as follows:
(i) Determine the charge-depleting ranges for city and highway operation as described in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation.
(ii) Calculate multi-day individual utility factors (UF) as described in § 600.116 corresponding to the driving ranges from paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(iii) Calculate values for the vehicle's average fuel economy over the charge-depleting range (in miles per kW-hr) for city and highway operation as described in § 600.210. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation. Convert these to $/mile values by dividing the appropriate fuel price from paragraph (e)(1) of this section by the average fuel economy determined in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii).
(iv) Calculate values for the vehicle's average fuel economy over the charge-sustaining range (in miles per gallon) for city and highway operation as described in § 600.210-12. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation. Convert these to $/mile values by dividing the appropriate fuel price from paragraph (e)(1) of this section by the average fuel economy determined in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
(v) Calculate a composite $/mile value for city driving using the following equation:
$/mile = $/mile
CD
× UF + $/mile
CS
× (1-UF)
(vi) Repeat the calculation in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section for highway driving.
(vii) Calculate the annual fuel cost based on the combined values for city and highway driving using the following equation:
Annual fuel cost = ($/milecity × 0.55 + $/milehwy × 0.45) × Average Annual Miles
(4) Round the annual fuel cost to the nearest $50 by dividing the unrounded annual fuel cost by 50, then rounding the result to the nearest whole number, then multiplying this rounded result by 50 to determine the annual fuel cost to be used for purposes of labeling.
(f)
Fuel savings.
Calculate an estimated five-year cost increment relative to an average vehicle by multiplying the annual fuel cost from paragraph (e) of this section by 5 and subtracting this value from the average five-year fuel cost. We will calculate the average five-year fuel cost from the annual fuel cost equation in paragraph (e) of this section based on a gasoline-fueled vehicle with a mean fuel economy value, consistent with the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings under paragraph (d) of this section. The average five-year fuel cost for model year 2012 is $12,600 for a 22-mpg vehicle that drives 15,000 miles per year with gasoline priced at $3.70 per gallon. We may periodically update this five year reference fuel cost for later model years to better characterize the fuel economy for an average vehicle. Round the calculated five-year cost increment to the nearest $50. Negative values represent a cost increase compared to the average vehicle.
(g)
Smog rating.
Establish a rating for exhaust emissions other than CO
2
based on the applicable emission standards for the appropriate model year as
shown in tables 1 through 3 to this paragraph (g). Unless specified otherwise, use the California emission standards to select the smog rating only for vehicles not certified to any EPA standards. For Independent Commercial Importers that import vehicles not subject to the identified emission standards, the vehicle's smog rating is 1. Similarly, if a manufacturer certifies vehicles to emission standards that are less stringent than all the identified standards for any reason, the vehicle's smog rating is 1. If EPA or California emission standards change in the future, we may revise the emission levels corresponding to each rating for future model years as appropriate to reflect the changed standards. If this occurs, we would publish the revised ratings as described in § 600.302-12(k), allowing sufficient lead time to make the changes; we would also expect to initiate a rulemaking to update the smog rating in the regulation.

emission values
. We will determine the range of combined fuel economy and CO

emission values for each vehicle class identified in § 600.315. We will generally update these range values before the start of each model year based on the lowest and highest values within
each vehicle class. We will also use this same information to establish a range of fuel economy values for all vehicles. Continue to use the most recently published numbers until we update them, even if you start a new model year before we publish the range values for the new model year.

(j)
Driving range.
Determine the driving range for certain vehicles as follows:
(1) For vehicles operating on nonpressurized liquid fuels, determine the vehicle's driving range in miles by multiplying the combined fuel economy described in paragraph (a) of this section by the vehicle's usable fuel storage capacity, rounded to the nearest whole number.
(2) For electric vehicles, determine the vehicle's overall driving range as described in Section 8 of SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011), with amendments and revisions as described in § 600.116. Determine separate range values for FTP-based city and HFET-based highway driving. Adjust these values to represent 5-cycle values as described in § 600.210-12(d)(3), then combine them arithmetically by averaging the two values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45, respectively, and rounding to the nearest whole number.
(3) For natural gas vehicles, determine the vehicle's driving range in miles by multiplying the combined fuel economy described in paragraph (a) of this section by the vehicle's usable fuel storage capacity (expressed in gasoline gallon equivalents), rounded to the nearest whole number.
(4) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, determine the adjusted charge-depleting (Rcda) driving range, the adjusted all electric driving range (if applicable), and overall adjusted driving range as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011), as described in § 600.116, as follows:
(i) Determine the vehicle's Actual Charge-Depleting Range, R
cda
, separately for FTP-based city and HFET-based highway driving. Adjust these values to represent 5-cycle values as described in 600.115-11, then combine them arithmetically by averaging the two values, weighted 0.55 and 0.45, respectively, and rounding to the nearest whole number. Precondition the vehicle as needed to minimize engine operation for consuming stored fuel vapors in evaporative canisters; for example, you may purge the evaporative canister or time a refueling event to avoid engine starting related to purging the canister. For vehicles that use combined power from the battery and the engine before the battery is fully discharged, also use this procedure to establish an all electric range by determining the distance the vehicle drives before the engine starts, rounded to the nearest mile. You may represent this as a range of values. We may approve adjustments to these procedures if they are necessary to properly characterize a vehicle's all electric range.
(ii) Use good engineering judgment to calculate the vehicle's operating distance before the fuel tank is empty when starting with a full fuel tank and a fully charged battery, consistent with the procedure and calculation specified in this paragraph (j), rounded to the nearest 10 miles.
(5) For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, determine the vehicle's driving range in miles by multiplying the combined fuel economy described in paragraph (a) of this section by the vehicle's usable fuel storage capacity (expressed in kilograms of hydrogen), rounded to the nearest whole number.
(k)
Charge time.
For electric vehicles, determine the time it takes to fully charge the battery from a 240 volt power source to the point that the battery meets the manufacturer's end-of-charge criteria, consistent with the procedures specified in SAE J1634 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011) for electric vehicles and in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in § 600.011) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, as described in § 600.116. This value may be more or less than the 12-hour minimum charging time specified for testing. You must alternatively specify the charge time based on a standard 120 volt power source if the vehicle cannot be charged at the higher voltage.
(l)
California-specific values.
If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in California are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy or other label values from those intended for sale in
other states, the Administrator will compute separate values for each class of automobiles for California and for the other states.

§ 600.315-08
Classes of comparable automobiles.
(a) The Secretary will classify automobiles as passenger automobiles or light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) in accordance with 49 CFR part 523.
(1) The Administrator will classify passenger automobiles by car line into one of the following classes based on interior volume index or seating capacity except for those passenger automobiles which the Administrator determines are most appropriately placed in a different classification or classed as special purpose vehicles as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(i)
Two seaters.
A car line shall be classed as “Two Seater” if the majority of the vehicles in that car line have no more than two designated seating positions as such term is defined in the regulations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation (DOT), 49 CFR 571.3.
(ii)
Minicompact cars.
Interior volume index less than 85 cubic feet.
(iii)
Subcompact cars.
Interior volume index greater than or equal to 85 cubic feet but less than 100 cubic feet.
(iv)
Compact cars.
Interior volume index greater than or equal to 100 cubic feet but less than 110 cubic feet.
(v)
Midsize cars.
Interior volume index greater than or equal to 110 cubic feet but less than 120 cubic feet.
(vi)
Large cars.
Interior volume index greater than or equal to 120 cubic feet.
(vii)
Small station wagons.
Station wagons with interior volume index less than 130 cubic feet.
(viii)
Midsize station wagons.
Station wagons with interior volume index greater than or equal to 130 cubic feet but less than 160 cubic feet.
(ix)
Large station wagons.
Station wagons with interior volume index greater than or equal to 160 cubic feet.
(2) The Administrator will classify light trucks (nonpassenger automobiles) into the following classes: Small pickup trucks, standard pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and SUVs. Starting in the 2013 model year, SUVs will be divided between small sport utility vehicles and standard sport utility vehicles. Pickup trucks and SUVs are separated by car line on the basis of gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). For a product line with more than one GVWR, establish the characteristic GVWR value for the product
line by calculating the arithmetic average of all distinct GVWR values less than or equal to 8,500 pounds available for that product line. The Administrator may determine that specific light trucks should be most appropriately placed in a different class or in the special purpose vehicle class as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, based on the features and characteristics of the specific vehicle, consumer information provided by the manufacturer, and other information available to consumers.
(i) Small pickup trucks. Pickup trucks with a GVWR below 6,000 pounds.
(ii) Standard pickup trucks. Pickup trucks with a GVWR at or above 6,000 pounds and at or below 8,500 pounds.
(iii) Vans.
(iv) Minivans.
(v) Small sport utility vehicles. Sport utility vehicles with a GVWR below 6,000 pounds.
(vi) Standard sport utility vehicles. Sport utility vehicles with a GVWR at or above 6,000 pounds and at or below 10,000 pounds.
(3)(i)
Special purpose vehicles.
All automobiles with GVWR less than or equal to 8,500 pounds and all medium-duty passenger vehicles which possess special features and which the Administrator determines are more appropriately classified separately from typical automobiles or which do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will be classified as special purpose vehicles. For example, the Administrator may determine that advanced technology vehicles (such as battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles equipped with hydrogen internal combustion engines) should be appropriately classified as a type of “special purpose vehicle.” The Administrator may determine appropriate names for such types of special purpose vehicles, different from the name “special purpose vehicle.”
(ii) All automobiles which possess features that could apply to two classes will be classified by the Administrator based on the Administrator's judgment on which class of vehicles consumers are more likely to make comparisons.
(4) Once a certain car line is classified by the Administrator, the classification will remain in effect for the model year.
(b)
Interior volume index—passenger automobiles.
(1) The interior volume index shall be calculated for each car line which is not a “two seater” car line, in cubic feet rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic foot. For car lines with more than one body style, the interior volume index for the car line is the arithmetic average of the interior volume indexes of each body style in the car line.
(2) For all body styles except station wagons and hatchbacks with more than one seat (e.g., with a second or third seat) equipped with seatbelts as required by DOT safety regulations, interior volume index is the sum, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic feet, of the front seat volume, the rear seat volume(s), if applicable, and the luggage capacity.
(3) For all station wagons and hatchbacks with more than one seat (e.g., with a second or third seat) equipped with seatbelts as required by DOT safety regulations, interior volume index is the sum, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic feet, of the front seat volume, the rear seat volume, and the cargo volume index.
