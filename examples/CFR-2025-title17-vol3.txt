# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 200.1
General statement and statutory authority.
The Securities and Exchange Commission was created in 1934 under the Securities Exchange Act. That Act transferred to the Commission the administration of the Securities Act of 1933, formerly administered by the Federal Trade Commission. Subsequent laws assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission for administration are: Trust Indenture Act of 1939, Investment Company Act of 1940, and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Commission is a statutory party in cases arising under chapters 9 and 11. Considered together, the laws administered by the Commission provided for the following.
(a) Public disclosure of pertinent facts concerning public offerings of securities and securities listed on national securities exchanges and certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets.

§ 200.2
Statutory functions.
Following are brief descriptions of the Commission's functions under each of the statutes it administers:
(a)
Securities Act of 1933.
(1) Issuers of securities making public offerings for sale in interstate commerce or through the mails, directly or by others on their behalf, are required to file with the Commission registration statements containing financial and other pertinent data about the issuer and the offering. A similar requirement is provided with respect to such public offerings on behalf of a controlling person of the issuer. Unless a registration statement is in effect with respect to such securities, it is unlawful to sell the securities in interstate commerce or through the mails. (There are certain limited exemptions, such as government securities, non-public offerings, and intrastate offerings.) The effectiveness of a registration statement may be refused or suspended after a hearing if the statement contains material misstatements or omissions, thus barring sale of the securities until it is appropriately amended. Registration is not a finding by the Commission as to the accuracy of the facts disclosed; and it is unlawful so to represent. Moreover, registration of securities does not imply approval of the issue by the Commission or insure investors against loss in their purchase, but serves rather to provide information upon which investors may make an informed and realistic evaluation of the worth of the securities.
(2) Persons responsible for filing false information with the Commission subject themselves to the risk of fine or imprisonment or both; and the issuing company, its directors, officers, and the underwriters and dealers and others may be liable in damages to purchasers of registered securities if the disclosures in the registration statements and prospectus are materially defective. Also the statute contains antifraud provisions which apply generally to the sale of securities, whether or not registered.
(b)
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This Act requires the filing of registration applications and annual and other reports with national securities exchanges and the Commission, by companies whose securities are listed on the exchanges. Annual and other reports must be filed also by certain companies whose securities are traded on the over-the-counter markets. These must contain financial and other data prescribed by the Commission for the information of investors. Material misstatements or omissions are grounds for suspension or withdrawal of the security from exchange trading. This Act makes unlawful any solicitation of proxies, authorizations, or consents in contravention of Commission rules. These rules require disclosure of information about the subject of the solicitation to security holders. The Act requires disclosure of the holdings and the transactions by an officer, director, or beneficial owner of over 10 percent of any class of equity security of certain companies. It also requires disclosure of the beneficial owners of more than five percent of any class of equity securities of a registered company. It provides substantive and procedural protection to security holders in third-party and issuer tender offers.
The Act also provides for the registration with, and regulation by, the Commission of national securities exchanges, brokers or dealers engaged in an over-the-counter securities business, and national associations of such brokers or dealers. It gives the Commission rulemaking power with respect to short sales, stabilizing, floor trading activities of specialists and odd-lot dealers, and such matters as excessive trading by exchange members. The Act authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe minimum margin requirements for listed securities.
(c)
Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
This Act safeguards the interests of purchasers of publicly-offered debt securities issued under trust indentures by requiring the inclusion of certain protective provisions in, and the exclusion of certain types of exculpatory clauses from, trust indentures. The Act also requires that an independent indenture trustee represent the debtors by proscribing certain relationships that could conflict with proper exercise of duties.
(d)
Investment Company Act of 1940.
This Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for investment companies and subjects their activities to regulation under standards prescribed for the protection of investors. Among other things, the Act provides for the registration of investment companies with the Commission; requires them to disclose their financial condition and investment policies to their shareholders; prohibits them from substantially changing investment policies without shareholder approval; bars persons guilty of securities fraud from serving as officers or directors; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, or brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of an investment company; requires that management contracts be submitted to shareholders for their approval; prohibits transactions between investment companies and their directors, officers, or affiliated companies or persons, except when approved by the Commission; and prohibits investment companies from issuing senior securities except under specified terms and conditions. The Act also regulates advisory fees, sales and repurchases of securities, exchange offers, and other activities of investment companies. The Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person or class of persons or securities from any provisions of, or rules under, the Act and to conduct any investigation it deems necessary to determine existing or potential violations of the Act. It also authorizes the Commission to prepare reports to security holders on the fairness of plans of reorganization, merger, or consolidation. The Commission may institute a court action to enjoin acts or practices of management involving, among other things, a breach of fiduciary duty and the consummation of plans of reorganization, merger, or consolidation that are grossly unfair to security holders.
(e)
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
Persons who, for compensation, engage in the business of advising others with respect to their security transactions must register with the Commission. Their activities in the conduct of such business are subject to standards of the act which make unlawful those practices which constitute fraud or deceit and which require, among other things, disclosure of any interests they may have in transactions executed for clients. The Act grants to the Commission rule-making power with respect to fraudulent and other activities of investment advisers.
(f)
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 1101
et seq.
) provides for Commission participation as a statutory party in reorganization cases. Under section 1109(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 1109(a)), which also applies to Chapter 9 cases regarding municipalities, the Commission “may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in the case.”

(n) Notwithstanding anything in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section, in any case in which the Director of the Examinations believes it appropriate, the Director may submit the matter to the Commission.

L. 94-29, 89 Stat. 163, the Commission hereby delegates to an individual Commissioner, to be designated as the Commission's “duty officer” by the Chairman of the Commission (or by the Chairman's designee) from time to time, all of the functions of the Commission;
Provided, however,
That no such delegation shall authorize the duty officer (i) to exercise the function of rulemaking, as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, as codified, 5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.,
with reference to general rules as distinguished from rules of particular applicability; (ii) to make any rule, pursuant to section 19(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (iii) to preside at the taking of evidence as described in section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 556(b), except that the duty officer may preside at the taking of evidence with respect to the issuance of a temporary cease-and-desist order as provided by Rule 511(c) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, § 201.511(c) of this chapter.
(2) To the extent feasible, the designation of a duty officer shall rotate, under the administration of the Secretary, on a regular weekly basis among the members of the Commission other than the Chairman.
(b)
Exercise of duty officer authority.
(1) The authority delegated by this rule shall be exercised when, in the opinion of the duty officer, action is required to be taken which, by reason of its urgency, cannot practicably be scheduled for consideration at a Commission meeting. After consideration of a staff
recommendation involving such a matter, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or her action thereon to the Secretary.
(2) The duty officer may, when in his or her opinion it would be proper and timely, exercise the authority delegated in this section to initiate by order a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77s(b)), section 21(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u(b)), section 42(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-41(b)), section 209(b) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-9(b)), and part 203 (Rules Relating to Investigations) of this title (17 CFR part 203). After consideration of a staff recommendation for initiation by order of a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding, the duty officer shall forthwith report his or her action thereon to the Secretary.
(3) In any consideration of Commission business by a duty officer, the provisions of subpart I herein, § 200.400
et seq.,
shall not apply, whether or not the duty officer, in exercising his or her authority, consults with, or seeks the advice of, other members of the Commission individually.
(c)
Commission affirmation of duty officer action.
(1) Any action authorized by a duty officer pursuant to § 200.43(a) shall be either (i) circulated to the members of the Commission for affirmation pursuant to § 200.42; or (ii) scheduled for affirmation at a Commission meeting at the earliest practicable date consistent with the procedures in subpart I.
(2)(i) The Commission may, in its discretion, at any time review any unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer, either upon its own initiative or upon the petition of any person affected thereby. The vote of any one member of the Commission, including the duty officer, shall be sufficient to bring any such unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer before the Commission for review.
(ii) A person or party adversely affected by any unaffirmed action taken by a duty officer shall be entitled to seek review by the Commission of the duty officer's unaffirmed actions, but only in the event that the unaffirmed action by the duty officer (A) denies any request for action pursuant to sections 8(a) or 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the first sentence of section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (B) suspends trading in a security pursuant to section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (C) is pursuant to any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a case of adjudication, as defined in section 551 of Title 5, U.S. Code, not required by that Act to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in section 554(a) (1) through (6) of Title 5, United States Code).
(3) Affirmed or unaffirmed action taken by the duty officer shall be deemed to be, for all purposes, the action of the Commission unless and until the Commission directs otherwise. Rules 430 and 431 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, §§ 201.430 and 201.431 of this chapter, shall not apply to duty officer action.

# Subpart C—Canons of Ethics

# Source:
25 FR 6725, July 15, 1960, unless otherwise noted.
§ 200.50
Authority.
The Canons of Ethics for Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission were approved by the Commission on July 22, 1958.
§ 200.51
Policy.
It is characteristic of the administrative process that the Members of the Commission and their place in public opinion are affected by the advice and conduct of the staff, particularly the professional and executive employees. It shall be the policy of the Commission to require that employees bear in mind the principles specified in the Canons.
§ 200.52
Copies of the Canons.
The Canons have been distributed to employees of the Commission. In addition, executive and professional employees are issued copies of the Canons upon entrance on duty.
§ 200.53
Preamble.
(a) Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission are entrusted by various enactments of the Congress with powers and duties of great social and economic significance to the American people. It is their task to regulate varied aspects of the American economy, within the limits prescribed by Congress, to insure that our private enterprise system serves the welfare of all citizens. Their success in this endeavor is a bulwark against possible abuses and injustice which, if left unchecked, might jeopardize the strength of our economic institutions.
(b) It is imperative that the members of this Commission continue to conduct themselves in their official and personal relationships in a manner which commands the respect and confidence of their fellow citizens. Members of this Commission shall continue to be mindful of, and strictly abide by, the standards of personal conduct set forth in its regulation regarding Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission, which is set forth in subpart M of this part 200, most of which has been in effect for many years, and which was originally codified in 1953.
(c) However, in addition to the continued observance of those principles of personal conduct, it is fitting and proper for the members of the Commission to restate and resubscribe to the standards of conduct applicable to its executive, legislative and judicial responsibilities.
[25 FR 6725, July 15, 1960, as amended at 31 FR 13533, Oct. 20, 1966]
§ 200.54
Constitutional obligations.
The members of this Commission have undertaken in their oaths of office to support the Federal Constitution. Insofar as the enactments of the Congress impose executive duties upon the members, they must faithfully execute the laws which they are charged with administering. Members shall also carefully guard against any infringement of the constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities of those who are subject to regulation by this Commission.
§ 200.55
Statutory obligations.
In administering the law, members of this Commission should vigorously enforce compliance with the law by all persons affected thereby. In the exercise of the rulemaking powers delegated this Commission by the Congress, members should always be concerned that the rulemaking power be confined to the proper limits of the law and be consistent with the statutory purposes expressed by the Congress. In the exercise of their judicial functions, members shall honestly, fairly and impartially determine the rights of all persons under the law.
§ 200.56
Personal conduct.
Appointment to the office of member of this Commission is a high honor and requires that the conduct of a member, not only in the performance of the duties of his office but also in his everyday life, should be beyond reproach.
§ 200.57
Relationships with other members.
Each member should recognize that his conscience and those of other members are distinct entities and that differing shades of opinion should be anticipated. The free expression of opinion is a safeguard against the domination of this Commission by less than a majority, and is a keystone of the commission type of administration. However, a member should never permit his personal opinion so to conflict with the opinion of another member as to develop animosity or unfriendliness in the Commission, and every effort should be made to promote solidarity of conclusion.
§ 200.58
Maintenance of independence.
This Commission has been established to administer laws enacted by the Congress. Its members are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to
serve terms as provided by law. However, under the law, this is an independent Agency, and in performing their duties, members should exhibit a spirit of firm independence and reject any effort by representatives of the executive or legislative branches of the government to affect their independent determination of any matter being considered by this Commission. A member should not be swayed by partisan demands, public clamor or considerations of personal popularity or notoriety; so also he should be above fear of unjust criticism by anyone.
§ 200.59
Relationship with persons subject to regulation.
In all matters before him, a member should administer the law without regard to any personality involved, and with regard only to the issues. Members should not become indebted in any way to persons who are or may become subject to their jurisdiction. No member should accept loans, presents or favors of undue value from persons who are regulated or who represent those who are regulated. In performing their judicial functions, members should avoid discussion of a matter with any person outside this Commission and its staff while that matter is pending. In the performance of his rule-making and administrative functions, a member has a duty to solicit the views of interested persons. Care must be taken by a member in his relationship with persons within or outside of the Commission to separate the judicial and the rule-making functions and to observe the liberties of discussion respectively appropriate. Insofar as it is consistent with the dignity of his official position, he should maintain contact with the persons outside the agency who may be affected by his rule-making functions, but he should not accept unreasonable or lavish hospitality in so doing.
§ 200.60
Qualification to participate in particular matters.
The question in a particular matter rests with that individual member. Each member should weigh carefully the question of his qualification with respect to any matter wherein he or any relatives or former business associates or clients are involved. He should disqualify himself in the event he obtained knowledge prior to becoming a member of the facts at issue before him in a quasi-judicial proceeding, or in other types of proceeding in any matter involving parties in whom he has any interest or relationship directly or indirectly. If an interested person suggests that a member should disqualify himself in a particular matter because of bias or prejudice, the member shall be the judge of his own qualification.
§ 200.61
Impressions of influence.
A member should not, by his conduct, permit the impression to prevail that any person can improperly influence him, that any person unduly enjoys his favor or that he is affected in any way by the rank, position, prestige, or affluence of any person.
§ 200.62
Ex parte communications.
All proceedings required to be determined by the Commission on the record shall be determined by the members solely upon the record and the arguments of the parties or their counsel properly made in the regular course of such proceeding. A member shall at all times comply with the Commission's Code of Behavior governing ex parte communications between persons outside the Commission and decisional employees, § 200.110
et seq.
[28 FR 4446, May 3, 1963]
§ 200.63
Commission opinions.
The opinions of the Commission should state the reasons for the action taken and contain a clear showing that no serious argument of counsel has been disregarded or overlooked. In such manner, a member shows a full understanding of the matter before him, avoids the suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, promotes confidence in his intellectual integrity and may contribute some useful precedent to the growth of the law. A member should be guided in his decisions by a deep regard for the integrity of the system of law which he administers. He should recall that he is not a repository of arbitrary power, but is acting on behalf of the public under the sanction of the law.
§ 200.64
Judicial review.
The Congress has provided for review by the courts of the decisions and orders by this Commission. Members should recognize that their obligation to preserve the sanctity of the laws administered by them requires that they pursue and prosecute, vigorously and diligently but at the same time fairly and impartially and with dignity, all matters which they or others take to the courts for judicial review.
§ 200.65
Legislative proposals.
Members must recognize that the changing conditions in a volatile economy may require that they bring to the attention of the Congress proposals to amend, modify or repeal the laws administered by them. They should urge the Congress, whenever necessary, to effect such amendment, modification or repeal of particular parts of the statutes which they administer. In any action a member's motivation should be the common weal and not the particular interests of any particular group.
§ 200.66
Investigations.
The power to investigate carries with it the power to defame and destroy. In determining to exercise their investigatory power, members should concern themselves only with the facts known to them and the reasonable inferences from those facts. A member should never suggest, vote for, or participate in an investigation aimed at a particular individual for reasons of animus, prejudice or vindictiveness. The requirements of the particular case alone should induce the exercise of the investigatory power, and no public pronouncement of the pendency of such an investigation should be made in the absence of reasonable evidence that the law has been violated and that the public welfare demand it.
§ 200.67
Power to adopt rules.
In exercising its rule-making power, this Commission performs a legislative function. The delegation of this power by the Congress imposes the obligation upon the members to adopt rules necessary to effectuate the stated policies of the statute in the interest of all of the people. Care should be taken to avoid the adoption of rules which seek to extend the power of the Commission beyond proper statutory limits. Its rules should never tend to stifle or discourage legitimate business enterprises or activities, nor should they be interpreted so as unduly and unnecessarily to burden those regulated with onerous obligations. On the other hand, the very statutory enactments evidence the need for regulation, and the necessary rules should be adopted or modifications made or rules should be repealed as changing requirements demand without fear or favor.
§ 200.68
Promptness.
Each member should promptly perform the duties with which he is charged by the statutes. The Commission should evaluate continuously its practices and procedures to assure that it promptly disposes of all matters affecting the rights of those regulated. This is particularly desirable in quasi-judicial proceedings. While avoiding arbitrary action in unreasonably or unjustly forcing matters to trial, members should endeavor to hold counsel to a proper appreciation of their duties to the public, their clients and others who are interested. Requests for continuances of matters should be determined in a manner consistent with this policy.
§ 200.69
Conduct toward parties and their counsel.
Members should be temperate, attentive, patient and impartial when hearing the arguments of parties or their counsel. Members should not condone unprofessional conduct by attorneys in their representation of parties. The Commission should continuously assure that its staff follows the same principles in their relationships with parties and counsel.
§ 200.70
Business promotions.
A member must not engage in any other business, employment or vocation while in office, nor may he ever use the power of his office or the influence of his name to promote the business interests of others.
§ 200.71
Fiduciary relationships.
A member should avoid service as a fiduciary if it would interfere or seem to interfere with the proper performance of his duties, or if the interests of those represented require investments in enterprises which are involved in questions to be determined by him. Such relationships would include trustees, executors, corporate directors, and the like.
§ 200.72
Supervision of internal organization.
Members and particularly the Chairman of the Commission should scrutinize continuously its internal organization in order to assure that such organization handles all matters before it efficiently and expeditiously, while recognizing that changing times bring changing emphasis in the administration of the laws.

# Subpart D—Information and Requests
§ 200.80
Securities and Exchange Commission records and information.
(a)
General provisions.
(1) This section contains the rules that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with the Commission's Privacy Act regulations at subpart H, as well as this section.
(2)(i) Records that the FOIA requires to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format (pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)) are accessible through the Commission's website,
http://www.sec.gov.
Each division and office of the Commission is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available in an electronic format, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each division and office shall ensure that its posted records and indexes are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.
(ii) Persons who do not have access to the internet may obtain these records by contacting the Commission's Office of FOIA Services by telephone at 202-551-7900 or by email at
foiapa@sec.gov.
(b)
Requirements for making requests for records
—(1)
How made and addressed.
The Commission has a centralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with all requests processed by the Office of FOIA Services. Requests for agency records must be in writing and include the requester's full name and a legible return address. Requesters may also include other contact information, such as an email address and a telephone number. Requests may be submitted by U.S. mail or delivery service and addressed to the Freedom of Information Act Officer, SEC, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. Requests may also be made by facsimile (202-772-9337), email (
foiapa@sec.gov
), or online at the Commission's website (
http://www.sec.gov
). The request (and envelope, if the request is mailed or hand-delivered) should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”
(2)
Requests for records about oneself or another individual.
(i) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provisions set forth in subpart H of this part to obtain any documents that would not be available to the public under the FOIA.
(ii) For requests for records about another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by the individual permitting disclosure of his or her records or proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). The Office of FOIA Services can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
(3)
Description of records sought.
A FOIA request must reasonably describe the agency records sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and subject matter to enable personnel within the divisions and offices of the Commission to locate them with a reasonable effort. Before submitting a request, a requester may contact the Office of FOIA Services' FOIA Public Liaisons to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records (contact information for these individuals is on the Commission's website,
http://www.sec.gov
). If the Office of FOIA Services determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or how the request is insufficient. A requester who is attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss the request with the Office of FOIA Services' designated FOIA contact, its FOIA Public Liaisons, or a representative of the Office of FOIA Services, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. When a requester fails to provide sufficient information within 30 calendar days after having been asked to reasonably describe the records sought, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester in writing that the request has not been properly made, that no further action will be taken, and that the FOIA request is closed. Such a notice constitutes an adverse determination under paragraph (e)(2) of this section for which the Office of FOIA Services shall follow the procedures for a denial letter under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In cases where a requester has modified his or her request so that it reasonably describes the requested records, the date of receipt for purposes of the 20-day time limit of paragraph (d) of this section shall be the date of receipt of the modified request.
(c)
Processing requests
—(1)
In general.
(i) A request for records may be denied to the extent the exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) apply to the requested records and:
(A) Commission staff reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by the applicable exemption; or
(B) The disclosure of the requested records is prohibited by law or is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).
(ii) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Office of FOIA Services ordinarily will include only records in the agency's possession as of the date that it begins its search.
(2)
Re-routing of misdirected requests.
Any division or office within the Commission that receives a written request for records should promptly forward the request to the Office of FOIA Services for processing.
(3)
Consultation, referral, and coordination.
When reviewing records located in response to a request, the Office of FOIA Services will determine whether another Federal agency is better able to determine if the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Office of FOIA Services will proceed in one of the following ways:
(i)
Consultation.
In instances where a record is requested that originated within a division or office within the Commission and another Federal agency has a significant interest in the record (or a portion thereof), the Office of FOIA Services will consult with that Federal agency before responding to a requester. When the Office of FOIA Services receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another entity within the Federal Government that is not subject to the FOIA, the Office of FOIA Services will typically consult with that entity prior to making a release determination.
(ii)
Referral.
When the Office of FOIA Services receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another Federal agency subject to the FOIA, the Office of FOIA Services will typically refer the record to that agency for direct response to the requester. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Office of FOIA Services and the originating agency jointly agree that the Office of FOIA Services is in the
best position to make a disclosure determination regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation and processed by the Office of FOIA Services. Whenever the Office of FOIA Services refers a record to another Federal agency for direct response to the requester, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester in writing of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the record was referred.
(iii)
Coordination.
If disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an exemption, the Office of FOIA Services generally will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views as to disclosure of the record and then advise the requester of the release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination.
(iv)
Classified information.
On receipt of any request involving classified information, the Commission staff in possession of the information shall determine whether the information is currently and properly classified and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with subpart J of this part. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another Federal agency under an executive order concerning the classification of records, the Office of FOIA Services shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever agency records contain information that has been classified by another Federal agency, the Office of FOIA Services shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information except in circumstances that come within paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(d)
Time limits and expeditedprocessing
—(1)
In general.
The Office of FOIA Services will seek to respond to requests according to their order of receipt within each track of the Office of FOIA Services' multitrack processing system as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(2)
Initial response.
A determination whether to comply with a FOIA request shall be made within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date the Office of FOIA Services receives a request for a record under this part, except when the circumstances described in paragraph (d)(3), (5), or (7) of this section are applicable. In instances where a FOIA requester has misdirected a request that is re-routed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the response time shall commence on the date that the request is first received by the Office of FOIA Services, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any division or office of the Commission.
(3)
Clarification of request.
The Office of FOIA Services may seek clarification of a request (or a portion of a request) for records. The request for clarification generally should be in writing. The first time the Office of FOIA Services seeks clarification, the time for responding to the entire request (set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) is tolled until the requester responds to the clarification request. The tolled period will end when the Office of FOIA Services receives a response from the requester that reasonably describes the requested records. If the Office of FOIA Services asks for clarification and does not receive a written response from the requester within 30 calendar days from the date of the clarification request, the Office of FOIA Services will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the record(s) sought and notify the requester that any portion of the request as to which clarification was sought has been closed.
(4)
Multitrack processing.
The Office of FOIA Services shall use a multitrack system for processing FOIA requests. The Office of FOIA Services shall designate one track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The Office of FOIA Services shall use two or more additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and
more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Office of FOIA Services may consider are the time to perform a search, the number of pages that must be reviewed in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. The Office of FOIA Services shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow the scope of their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.
(5)
Unusual circumstances.
The Office of FOIA Services may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request in “unusual circumstances.” To extend the time, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request is expected to be completed. If the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Office of FOIA Services shall provide the requester, in writing, with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. The Office of FOIA Services shall also make available its FOIA Public Liaisons to assist in the resolution of any disputes and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. For purposes of this section, “unusual circumstances” include:
(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request.
(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are the subject of a single request.
(iii) The need to consult with another Federal agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the FOIA request or among two or more divisions or offices within the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
(6)
Aggregating requests.
The Office of FOIA Services may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably believes that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, together constitute a single request that would involve unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated. The Office of FOIA Services shall advise requesters, in writing, when it determines to aggregate multiple requests and comply with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Aggregation of requests for this purpose will be conducted independent of aggregation requests for fee purposes under paragraph (g)(8) of this section.
(7)
Expedited processing.
The Office of FOIA Services shall grant a request for expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a “compelling need” for the records. “Compelling need” means that a failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to an individual's life or physical safety or, if the requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information, an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
(i) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time.
(ii) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining why there is a “compelling need” for the records.
(iii) The Office of FOIA Services shall determine whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing and provide notice of that determination within 10 calendar days of receipt of the request by the Office of FOIA Services. A request for records that has been granted expedited processing shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that determination shall be decided expeditiously.
(8)
Appeals.
An administrative appeal shall be decided within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date the Office of FOIA Services receives such appeal except in the unusual circumstances
specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. In those unusual circumstances, the 20-day time limit may be extended by written notice to the person making the appeal setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension of more than 10 working days.
(e)
Responses to requests forrecords
—(1)
Acknowledgment of requests.
Upon receipt of a request for records, the Office of FOIA Services ordinarily will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that provides an assigned request number for further reference and, if necessary, confirms whether the requester is willing to pay fees.
(2)
Responses to requests.
(i) Any letter determining whether to comply with a request will inform the requester of the right to seek assistance from the Office of FOIA Services' FOIA Public Liaisons.
(ii) If the Office of FOIA Services makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing of such determination, disclose records to the requester, and collect any applicable fees.
(iii) If the Office of FOIA Services makes an adverse determination regarding a request, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the requested record does not exist (or is not subject to the FOIA), cannot be located, or has previously been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily producible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include designations of requesters' fee category, denials of fee waiver requests, or denials of requests for expedited processing.
(iv) An adverse determination letter shall be signed and include:
(A) The names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the adverse determination;
(B) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption applied by the official denying the request;
(C) For records disclosed in part, markings or annotations to show the applicable FOIA exemption(s) and the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if feasible;
(D) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld by providing the number of pages withheld in their entirety or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on the records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption;
(E) A statement that the adverse determination may be appealed under paragraph (f) of this section, and a description of the requirements for filing an administrative appeal set forth in that paragraph; and
(F) A statement of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of FOIA Services' FOIA Public Liaisons or the Office of Government Information Services (“OGIS”).
(3)
Mediation services.
OGIS offers mediation services to resolve disputes between requesters and the Office of FOIA Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Requesters with concerns about the handling of their requests may contact OGIS.
(f)
Administrative appeals
—(1)
Administrative review.
If a requester receives an adverse determination as described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, or the request has not been timely determined within the time period prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or within an extended period permitted under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the requester may file an appeal to the Office of the General Counsel consistent with the procedures described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) of this section. A requester must generally submit a timely administrative appeal before seeking review by a court of an adverse determination.
(2)
Time limits.
Appeals can be submitted in writing or electronically, as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The appeal must be received within 90 calendar days of the date of the written denial of the adverse determination and must be received no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 90th day. If the Office of FOIA Services has not issued a determination on a request, an appeal may be submitted any time after the statutory time period for responding to a request ends.
(3)
Contents of appeal.
Appeals should be clearly and prominently identified at the top of the first page as “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and should provide the assigned FOIA request number. The appeal should include a copy of the original request and adverse determination. Appeals should include a statement of the requester's arguments as to why the records requested should be made available and the reason(s) the FOIA requester contends the adverse determination was in error. If only a portion of the adverse determination is appealed, the requester must specify which part is being appealed.
(4)
How to file and address an appeal.
If submitted by U.S. mail or delivery service, the appeal must be sent to the Office of FOIA Services at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. Appeals may also be made by facsimile at 202-772-9337, email (
foiapa@sec.gov
), or online at the Commission's website (
http://www.sec.gov
). A legible return address must be included with the FOIA appeal. The requester may also include other contact information, such as a telephone number and/or email address.
(5)
Adjudication of appeals.
The Office of the General Counsel has the authority to grant or deny all appeals, in whole or in part. In appropriate cases the Office of the General Counsel may refer appeals to the Commission for determination. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing on appeal is provided. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Office of FOIA Services ordinarily will send the requester an acknowledgment letter that confirms receipt of the requester's appeal.
(6)
Determinations on appeals.
A determination on an appeal must be made in writing. A determination that denies an appeal, in whole or in part, shall include a brief explanation of the basis for the denial, identify the applicable FOIA exemptions asserted, and describe why the exemptions apply. As applicable, the determination will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4), and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Office of FOIA Services' determination is remanded or modified on appeal, the Office of the General Counsel will notify the requester of that determination in writing.
(g)
Fees
—(1)
In general.
The Office of FOIA Services shall charge fees for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines, except where fees are limited under paragraph (g)(4) of this section or when a waiver or reduction is granted under paragraph (g)(12) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the Office of FOIA Services may contact a requester for additional information. The Office of FOIA Services shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in an efficient manner. The Office of FOIA Services ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check, certified check, or money order, or where possible, by electronic payment.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(i)
Commercial use request
is a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Office of FOIA Services will determine whether to place a requester in the commercial use category on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.
(ii)
Direct costs
are those expenses the Office of FOIA Services and any staff within the divisions and offices of the Commission incur in searching for and
duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee(s) performing the work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee(s), plus 16% of that rate to cover benefits), the cost of materials, and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and of heating or lighting a facility in which the service is performed.
(iii)
Duplication
is reproducing a record, or the information contained in it, to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others. The Office of FOIA Services shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.
(iv)
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution and that the records are not sought for commercial or personal use.
(v)
Noncommercial scientific institution
is an institution that is not operated to further a commercial, trade, or profit interest and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.
(vi)
Representative of the news media
or
news media requester
is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.
(vii)
Review
is the examination of a record located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, such as redacting the record and marking any applicable exemptions. Review time also includes time spent obtaining and considering formal objections to disclosure made by a submitter under § 200.83, but it does not include time spent resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(viii)
Search
is the review, manually or by automated means, of agency records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.
(3)
Charging fees.
In responding to FOIA requests, the Office of FOIA Services shall charge fees for the services summarized in chart form in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section and explained in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii) through (v) of this section, unless fees are limited under paragraph (g)(4) of this section or a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (g)(12) of this section.
(i) The four categories of requesters and the chargeable fees for each are:
Requester category
Search fees
Review fees
Duplication fees
(A) Commercial use requesters
Yes
Yes
Yes.
(B) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions
No
No
Yes (first 100 pages, or equivalent volume, free).
(C) Representatives of the news media
No
No
Yes (first 100 pages, or equivalent volume, free).
(D) All other requesters
Yes (first 2 hours free)
No
Yes (first 100 pages, or equivalent volume, free).
(ii)
Search fees.
(A) Search fees shall be charged for all requests—other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media—subject to the limitations of paragraph (g)(4) of this section. The Office of FOIA Services may charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located or it is determined that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by agency employees.
(B) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate or identify responsive records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating and implementing such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
(C) For requests that require the retrieval of agency records stored at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.
(iii)
Review fees.
Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,
i.e.,
the review agency employees conduct to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. Also, if an exemption asserted to withhold a record (or a portion thereof) is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the re-review of the records to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the review by the involved employees. Review fees can be charged even if the records reviewed ultimately are not disclosed.
(iv)
Search and review services (review applies to commercial-use requesters only).
(A) The Office of FOIA Services will establish and charge average rates for the groups of employees' salary grades typically involved in the search and review of records. Those groups will consist of employees at:
(
1
) Grades SK-8 or below;
(
2
) Grades SK-9 to SK-13; and
(
3
) Grades SK-14 or above.
(B) The average rates will be based on the hourly salary (
i.e.,
basic salary plus locality payment), plus 16 percent for benefits, of employees who routinely perform search and review services. The average hourly rates are listed on the FOIA web page of the Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov
and will be updated as salaries change. Fees will be charged in quarter-hour increments. No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
(v)
Duplication fees.
Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Fees for either a photocopy or printout of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied) are identified on the FOIA web page of the Commission's website at
www.sec.gov.
For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Office of FOIA Services shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For all other forms of duplication, the Office of FOIA Services shall also charge the direct costs.
(4)
Limitations on charging fees.
(i) No search or review fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the requests are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
(ii) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the Office of FOIA Services shall provide without charge the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) and the first two hours of search.
(iii) Fees will not be charged where the costs of collecting and processing the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee.
(iv) The Office of FOIA Services will not assess search fees (or, in the case of
requests from representatives of the news media or educational or noncommercial scientific institutions, duplication fees) when 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(viii) prohibits the assessment of those fees.
(5)
Notice of anticipated fees.
(i) When the Office of FOIA Services determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed the amount it would cost the Office of FOIA Services to collect and process the fees, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as the estimated fees. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Office of FOIA Services shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is not a commercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge.
(ii) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees will amount to more than it would cost the Office of FOIA Services to collect and process the fees, or amount to more than the amount the requester indicated a willingness to pay, the Office of FOIA Services will do no further work on the request until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a requester who is not a commercial use requester, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The Office of FOIA Services will toll the response period while it notifies the requester of the actual or estimated amount of fees and this time will be excluded from the 20 working day time limit (as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section). The requester's agreement to pay fees must be made in writing, must designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay, and must be received within 30 calendar days from the date of the notification of the fee estimate. If the requester fails to submit an agreement to pay the anticipated fees within 30 calendar days from the date of the Office of FOIA Services' fee notice, the Office of FOIA Services will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and notify the requester that the request has been closed.
(iii) The Office of FOIA Services shall make available their FOIA Public Liaisons or other FOIA professionals to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(6)
Charges for other services.
Although not required to provide special services, if the Office of FOIA Services chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such special services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail. The cost for the attestation of records with the Commission seal (
i.e.,
certifying records as true copies) is $4.00 per record, which may be waived for records certified electronically. Requests for certified copies of records or documents shall ordinarily be serviced within 20 working days. Requests will be processed in the order in which they are received.
(7)
Charging interest.
The Office of FOIA Services may begin to charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and accrue from the date of the billing until the payment is received. The Office of FOIA Services shall take all steps authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, and the Commission's Rules Relating to Debt Collection to effect payment, including offset, disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, and use of collection agencies.
(8)
Aggregating requests.
If the Office of FOIA Services reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees,
the Office of FOIA Services may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Among the factors the Office of FOIA Services shall consider in deciding whether to aggregate are whether the requests were submitted close in time and whether the requests seek documents about related matters. The Office of FOIA Services may presume that multiple requests that involve related matters made by the same requester or a group of requesters within a 30 calendar day period have been made to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Office of FOIA Services will aggregate them only where it determines that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.
(9)
Advance payments.
(i) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(9)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the Office of FOIA Services shall not require a requester to make advance payment (
i.e.,
payment made before the Office of FOIA Services begins to process or continues to work on a request). Payment owed for work already completed (
i.e.,
payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
(ii) When the Office of FOIA Services determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated fee and may require the requester to make an advance payment of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Office of FOIA Services' FOIA Public Liaisons or other FOIA professionals to modify the request in an effort to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(iii) When a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the Office of FOIA Services or other Federal agency within 30 calendar days of the date of billing, the Office of FOIA Services shall notify the requester that he or she is required to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the Office of FOIA Services begins to process a new request or continues processing a pending request from that requester. Where the Office of FOIA Services has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity and pay in advance.
(iv) When the Office of FOIA Services requires advance payment or payment due under paragraphs (g)(9)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the Office of FOIA Services will not further process the request until the required payment is made. The Office of FOIA Services will toll the processing of the request while it notifies the requester of the advanced payment due and this time will be excluded from the 20 working day time limit (as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section). If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days from the date of the Office of FOIA Services' fee notice, the Office of FOIA Services will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and notify the requester that the request has been closed.
(10)
Tolling.
When necessary for the Office of FOIA Services to clarify issues regarding fee assessment with the requester, the time limit for responding to a FOIA request is tolled until the Office of FOIA Services resolves such issues with the requester.
(11)
Other statutes specifically providing for fees.
The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute (except the FOIA) that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Office of FOIA Services shall inform the requester how to obtain records from that program. Provision of such records is not handled under the FOIA.
(12)
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.
(i) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge, or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, if the requester asks for such a waiver in writing and the Office
of FOIA Services determines, after consideration of information provided by the requester, that the requester has demonstrated that:
(A) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and
(B) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(ii) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, the Office of FOIA Services shall consider each of the following four factors:
(A)
The subject of the request:
whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(B)
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities to be likely to contribute to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding.
(C)
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure:
whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.
(D)
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question prior to the disclosure must be significantly enhanced by the disclosure.
(iii) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Office of FOIA Services shall consider the following factors:
(A)
The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest:
whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. The Office of FOIA Services shall consider any commercial interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use requester” in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(B)
The primary interest in disclosure:
whether the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Office of FOIA Services ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(iv) If only a portion of the requested records satisfies both the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction of fees will be granted for only that portion.
(v) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should address all the factors identified in paragraphs (g)(12)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(vi) Denials of requests for a waiver or reduction of fees are adverse determinations (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section) and may be
appealed to the General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.

) or any rule or regulation thereunder, where the issuance of an order granting such exemption does not require public notice and an opportunity for hearing; together with any written response thereto, shall be made available for inspection and copying by any person as soon as practicable after the response has been sent or given to the person requesting it.
(b) Any person submitting such letter or other written communication may also submit therewith a request that it be accorded confidential treatment for a specified period of time, not exceeding 120 days from the date the response, together with a statement setting forth the considerations upon which the request for such treatment is based. If the staff determines that the request is reasonable and appropriate it will be granted and the letter or other communication will not be made available for public inspection or copying until the expiration of the specified period. If it appears to the staff that the request for confidential treatment should be denied, the staff shall so advise the person making the request and such person may withdraw the letter or other communication within 30 days thereafter. In such case, no response will be sent or given and the letter or other communication shall remain in the Commission's files but will not be made public. If such letter or other communication is not so withdrawn, it shall be deemed to be available for public inspection and copying together with any written response thereto.

# Note:
All letters or other written communications requesting interpretative advice, a no-action position, or an exemption shall indicate prominently, in a separate caption at the beginning of the request, each section of the Act and each rule to which the request relates. If more than one section or rule is involved, a separate copy of the request shall be submitted for each section or rule involved and an additional copy for the use of the staff of the Commission.
(c) This section shall not apply, however, to letters of comment or other communications relating to the accuracy or adequacy of any registration statement, report, proxy, or information statement or other document filed with the Commission, or relating to the extent to which such statement, report, or document complies with any applicable requirement. Further, this section shall not apply to applications or other written communications filed pursuant to § 240.24b-2 that relate to objections to public disclosure of information filed with the Commission or any exchange.

[37 FR 20558, Sept. 30, 1972]
§ 200.83
Confidential treatment procedures under the Freedom of Information Act.
(a)
Purpose.
This section provides a procedure by which persons submitting
information in any form to the Commission can request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other context. This section is procedural only and does not provide rights to any person or alter the rights of any person under the Freedom of Information Act or any other applicable statute or regulation.
(b)
Scope.
The provisions of this section shall apply only where no other statute or Commission rule provides procedures for requesting confidential treatment respecting particular categories of information (
see,
e.g., 17 CFR 240.24b-2) or where the Commission has not specified that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any record which is contained in or is part of a personnel, medical or similar file relating to a Commission member or employee which would normally be exempt from disclosure pursuant to section 552(b)(6) of title 5, U.S. Code.
(c)
Written request for confidential treatment to be submitted with information.
(1) Any person who, either voluntarily or pursuant to any requirement of law, submits any information or causes or permits any information to be submitted to the Commission, which information is entitled to confidential treatment and for which no other specific procedure exists for according confidential treatment, may request that the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy or business confidentiality, or for any other reason permitted by Federal law, and should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as nearly as practicable, that at the time the information is first received by the Commission (i) it is supplied segregated from information for which confidential treatment is not being requested, (ii) it is appropriately marked as confidential, and (iii) it is accompanied by a written request for confidential treatment which specifies the information as to which confidential treatment is requested.
(2) A person who submits a record to the Commission for which he or she seeks confidential treatment must clearly mark each page or segregable portion of each page with the words “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]” and an identifying number and code, such as a Bates-stamped number. In his or her written confidential treatment request, the person must refer to the record by identifying number and code.
(3) In addition to giving a copy of any written request for confidential treatment to the Commission employee receiving the record in question, the person requesting confidential treatment must send a copy of the request (but not the record) by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549. The legend “FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” must clearly and prominently appear on the top of the first page of the written request, and the written request must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting confidential treatment. The person requesting confidential treatment is responsible for informing the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations promptly of any changes in address, telephone number, or representation.
(4) In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing a record requested in the course of a Commission examination or inspection, it may be impracticable to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the record is first given to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting any record to the Commission. The person testifying or otherwise submitting the record must inform the Commission employee receiving it, at the time the record is submitted or as soon thereafter as possible, that he or she is requesting confidential treatment. The person must then submit a written confidential treatment request
within 30 days from the date of the testimony or the submission of the record. Any confidential treatment request submitted under this paragraph must also comply with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(5) Where confidential treatment is requested by the submitter on behalf of another person, the request must identify that person and provide the telephone number and address of that person or the person's responsible representative if the submitter would be unable to provide prompt substantiation of the request at the appropriate time.
(6) No determination on a request for confidential treatment will be made until the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations receives a request for disclosure of the record.
(7) A confidential treatment request will expire ten years from the date the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations receives it, unless that Office receives a renewal request before the confidential treatment request expires. The renewal request must be sent by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, and must clearly identify the record for which confidential treatment is sought. A renewal request will likewise expire ten years from the date that Office receives it, unless that Office receives another timely renewal request which complies with the requirements of this paragraph.
(8) A confidential treatment request shall be nonpublic. If an action is filed in a Federal court, however, by either the Freedom of Information Act requester (under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) and § 200.80(f)) or by the confidential treatment requester (under paragraph (e)(5) of this section), the confidential treatment request may become part of the court record.
(d)
Substantiation of request for confidential treatment.
(1) If it is determined that records which are the subject of a request for access under the Freedom of Information Act are also the subject of a request for confidential treatment under this rule and no other grounds appear to exist which would justify the withholding of the records [e.g., Freedom of Information Act Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A)], the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer promptly shall so inform the person requesting confidential treatment or, in the case of a request made on behalf of a person other than the submitter, the person identified as able to provide substantiation, by telephone, facsimile or certified mail and require that substantiation of the request for confidential treatment be submitted in ten calendar days. Failure to submit a written substantiation within ten calendar days from the time of notification, or any extension thereof, may be deemed a waiver of the confidential treatment request and the confidential treatment requester's right to appeal an initial decision denying confidential treatment to the Commission's General Counsel as permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or necessary for the determination of the request for confidential treatment, the following information regarding the request:
(i) The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;
(ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;
(iii) The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by the Commission, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning confidential treatment of the information;
(iv) The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business' competitive position;
(v) The measures taken by the business to protect the confidentiality of the commercial or financial information in question and of similar information, prior to, and after, its submission to the Commission;
(vi) The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling the commercial or financial information;
(vii) Whether the commercial or financial information was voluntarily submitted to the Commission and, if so, whether and how disclosure of the information would tend to impede the availability of similar information to the Commission;
(viii) The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded confidential treatment; and
(ix) Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as the requesting person may consider appropriate.
(e)
Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is not warranted.
(1) In a preliminary decision, which shall be sent by mail or facsimile, or both, the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations will inform the confidential treatment requester whether it intends to grant confidentiality in whole or in part and give the requester ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary decision to submit supplemental arguments if the requester disagrees with the preliminary decision. A final decision, which shall also be sent by mail or facsimile, or both, no sooner than ten calendar days from the date of the preliminary decision, shall inform the Freedom of Information Act requester and the confidential treatment requester of his or her right to appeal an adverse decision to the Commission's General Counsel within ten calendar days from the date of the final decision. Records, which the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Officer determines to be releasable, may be released to the Freedom of Information Act requester ten calendar days after the date of the final decision. However, if within those ten calendar days, the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Officer receives an appeal from the confidential treatment requester, he or she shall inform the Freedom of Information Act requester that an appeal is pending and that the records will not be released until the appeal is resolved.
(2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly and prominently identified on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page by the legend “FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.” The appeal must be sent by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, or by facsimile (202-772-9337). A copy of the appeal must be mailed to the General Counsel, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549. The person requesting confidential treatment may supply additional substantiation of the request for confidential treatment in connection with the appeal to the General Counsel.
(3) The General Counsel shall have the authority to consider all appeals from decisions of the Freedom of Information Act Officer with respect to confidential treatment. All appeals taken under this section will be considered by the General Counsel as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible, the General Counsel will decide the matter on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the interested persons and such other information as is brought to the attention of the General Counsel. The General Counsel shall also have the authority to enter and vacate stays under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. In appropriate cases the General Counsel may, in his or her sole and unfettered discretion, refer appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (e)(5) of this section to the Commission for decision.
(4) If it is determined that confidential treatment is not warranted with respect to all or any part of the information in question, the person requesting confidential treatment will be so informed by telephone, if possible, with a facsimile or certified mail letter directed to the person's last known address. Disclosure of the information under the Freedom of Information Act will occur ten calendar days after notice to the person requesting confidential treatment, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (e) (5) of this section.
(5) If within that ten calendar day period the General Counsel has been notified that the person requesting confidential treatment has commenced an action in a Federal court concerning the determination to make such information publicly available, the General Counsel will stay making the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel may vacate a stay under this section either on his or her own motion or at the request of a person seeking access to the information under the Freedom of Information Act. If the stay is vacated, the information will be released under the Freedom of Information Act ten calendar days after the person requesting confidential treatment is notified of this action by telephone, if possible, with a facsimile or certified mail letter sent to the person's last known address, unless the court orders otherwise.
(f)
Initial determination that confidential treatment is warranted.
If it is determined by the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer that confidential treatment is warranted, the person submitting the information and the person requesting access to the information under the Freedom of Information Act will be so informed by mail. The person requesting access, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, will also be informed of the right to appeal the determination to the General Counsel. Any such appeal must be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and Commission rules thereunder.
See
17 CFR 200.80(f).
(g)
Confidential treatment request and substantiation as nonpublic.
Any confidential treatment request and substantiation of it shall be nonpublic. If an action is filed in a Federal court, however, by the Freedom of Information Act requester (under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) and § 200.80(f)) or by the confidential treatment requester (under paragraph (e)(5) of this section), both the request and substantiation may become part of the public court record.
(h)
Effect of no prior request for confidentiality.
(1) If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act to information which is submitted to the Commission on or after October 20, 1980 with respect to which no request for confidential treatment has been made pursuant to either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(5) of this section, it will be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting an exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act for reasons of personal privacy or business confidentiality, or for other reasons.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this section, in appropriate circumstances, any person who would be affected by the public disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act may be contacted by Commission personnel to determine whether the person desires to make a request for confidential treatment. Any request for confidential treatment that is asserted in response to such inquiry shall be made in accordance with provisions of this section.
(i)
Extensions of time limits.
Any time limit under this section may be extended in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, or the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Officer for good cause shown.
(j)
Electronic filings.
Confidential treatment requests shall be submitted in paper format only, whether or not the person making the request is an electronic filer.
(k) In their discretion, the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, and the Freedom of Information Act Officer may use alternative procedures for considering requests for confidential treatment.

In addition, an ex parte communication shall not include:
(i) Any written communication of which copies are served by the communicator contemporaneously with the transmittal of the communication in accordance with requirements of Rule 150 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, § 201.150 of this chapter, upon all participants to the proceeding (including the interested Division or Office of the Commission); or

§ 200.112
Duties of recipient; notice to participants.
(a)
Duties of recipient.
A member of the Commission or decisional employee who receives, or who make or knowingly causes to be made, a communication prohibited by this section, or who receives or makes a communication which he or she concludes should, in fairness, be brought to the attention of all participants to the proceeding, shall transmit to the Commission's Secretary, who shall place on the public record of the proceeding:
(1) All such written communications; and
(2) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and

Notice to participants.
The Secretary shall send copies of the communication to all participants to the proceeding with respect to which it was made, and shall notify the communicator of the provisions of this code prohibiting ex parte communications. If the communications are from persons other than participants to the proceedings or their agents, and the Secretary determines that it would be too burdensome to send copies of the communications to all participants because: (1) The communications are so voluminous, or (2) the communications are of such borderline relevance to the issues of the proceedings, or (3) the participants to the proceeding are so numerous, the Secretary may, instead, notify the participants that the communications have been received, placed in the file, and are available for examination.
(c)
Post decisional communications.
Any Commission member or decisional employee who receives a communication which would be prohibited by this Code, but for the fact that it was received subsequent to the date when the prohibitions imposed hereby have ceased to apply, shall comply with the provisions of § 200.112(a) with respect to such communication in the event that he or she is to act in a decisional capacity in the same proceeding pursuant to remand where he or she concludes, in fairness, that such communication should be brought to the attention of all participants to the proceeding.

employee may instruct any of his assistants who are nondecisional employees to intercept any communication directed to him which might appear to violate this Code and authorize them either to transmit any such written communication to the staff of the interested division of the Commission, if it appears from the contents of the communication that the intent of the sender is consistent with such action, or to return the communication to the sender.

(a)
How to make an inquiry or request for access.
An inquiry or request for access must be in writing and may be submitted by email (
foiapa@sec.gov
) or online at the Commission's website at
https://www.sec.gov/forms/request_public_docs.
A requester may alternatively submit an inquiry or request for access by mail to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or other mailing address or facsimile number published on the Commission's website at
https://www.sec.gov/oso/help/foia-contact.html.
Inquiries and requests for access that
are submitted by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the envelope.
(b)
Information to be included in an inquiry or request for access.
Each inquiry or request for access must include information that will assist the Commission in identifying those records the requester is seeking information about or access to. The following information, as relevant, should be submitted with the request: name of the individual whose record is sought; identifying data that will help locate the record (
e.g.,
maiden name and period or place of employment); and the requester's name, address, telephone number, and email address. Where practicable, the requester should identify the system of records that is the subject of the inquiry or request for access by reference to the Commission's systems of records notices, which are published in the
Federal Register.
The Commission's systems of records notices can also be found on the Commission's website at
https://www.sec.gov/oit/system-records-notices.
If additional information is required before a request can be processed, the requester will be so advised.
(c)
Verification of identity.
A requester making an inquiry or requesting access to a record must verify his or her identity before information is given or access is granted unless the information is required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.
(1)
In-person verification.
A requester may appear at any of the Commission offices, which are listed on the Commission's website at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions.shtml,
and furnish documentation to establish his or her identity. Such documentation might include a valid driver's license, passport, birth certificate, employee or military identification card, or Medicare card. Sufficiency of the documentation in verifying identity will be determined by the Commission staff member reviewing such documentation.
(2)
Not in-person verification.
A requester who does not appear in person must verify his or her identity using one of the following methods:
(i) A requester may use electronic identity proofing and authentication processes as made available through the Commission's website; or

Submission of signed statement.
For all verification methods, a requester must also submit a statement attesting to the requester's identity and a statement that the requester understands that a knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense subject to a $5,000 fine. Sample statements and the requirements for completing them are available through the Commission's website.
(4)
Additional procedures for verifying identity.
When it appears appropriate, the Commission's Office of FOIA Services may make such other arrangements for the verification of identity as are reasonable under the circumstances and appear to be effective to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, individual records.
§ 200.304
Responses to inquiries and requests for access.

Initial review.
Inquiries and requests for access will be referred to the Commission's Office of FOIA Services which will make the initial determination as to whether the inquiry or request for access will be granted.

(c)
Denial of an inquiry or request for access.
If it is determined that no response will be given to an inquiry or that a request for access will not be granted, the requester will be notified of that fact in writing and given the reasons for the denial. The requester also will be advised of his or her right to seek review by the Office of the General Counsel of the initial decision in

# Note:
The Commission intends, to the extent convenient, to adhere to the following schedule in organizing its weekly agenda: Closed meetings to consider matters concerning the enforcement of the federal securities laws and the conduct of related investigations will generally be held on Tuesdays and on Thursday afternoons. An open meeting will generally be held each Thursday morning to consider matters of any appropriate nature. On Wednesdays, either open or closed meetings, or both, will generally be held according to the requirements of the Commission's agenda for the week in question. Normally, no meetings will be scheduled on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
The foregoing tentative general schedule is set forth for the guidance of the public, but is not, in any event, binding upon the Commission. In every case, the scheduling of Commission meetings shall be determined by the demands of Commission business, consistent with the requirements of this subpart I. When feasible, the Commission will endeavor to announce the subject matter of all then-contemplated open meetings during a particular month at least one week prior to the commencement of that month.
When and if convenient after the conclusion of a closed Commission meeting, the Commission will endeavor to make publicly available a notice describing (subject to the provision in § 200.402(d) regarding nonpublic matter in announcements) the items considered at that meeting and any action taken thereon.
§ 200.404
General procedure for determination to close meeting.
(a)
Action to close meeting.
Action to close a meeting pursuant to § 200.402(a) or (c) shall be taken only upon a vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission. A separate vote of the Commission members shall be taken with respect to each Commission meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to § 200.402(a), or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under § 200.402(d);
Provided, however,
That a single vote may be taken with respect to a series of
meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series relates to the same matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Commission member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
(b)
Announcement of action to close meeting.
Within one day of any vote pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or § 200.409(a) (relating to review of Commission determinations to open a meeting), the Commission shall make publicly available:

The procedure described in this rule may be utilized notwithstanding the fact that a meeting or portion thereof properly subject to being closed pursuant to § 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i), or (10), or any combination thereof, could also be closed pursuant to § 200.402(a) (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), or (9)(ii), or any combination thereof.
(c)
Announcement of action to close meeting.
In the case of a meeting or a portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this rule, as soon as practicable the Commission shall make publicly available:
(1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating member of the Commission to close the meeting; and
(2) The certification described in § 200.406, executed by the Commission's General Counsel.
§ 200.406
Certification by the General Counsel.
For every Commission meeting closed pursuant to § 200.402(a) (1) through (10), the General Counsel of the Commission (or, in his or her absence, the attorney designated by General Counsel pursuant to § 200.21) shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision.
§ 200.407
Transcripts, minutes, and other documents concerning closed Commission meetings.

Except as provided in § 200.407(b), the Commission's Secretary shall prepare a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each closed meeting, or closed portion of a meeting.
(b)
Minutes of closed meetings.
In the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to § 200.402(a) (8), (9)(i), or (10), the Secretary may, in his or her discretion or at the direction of the Commission, prepare either the transcript or recording described in § 200.407(a), or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any rollcall vote (reflecting the vote of each participating Commission member on the question). All documents specifically
considered by the Commission in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes are maintained.
(c)
Retention of certificate and statement.
The Secretary shall retain a copy of every certification executed by the General Counsel pursuant to § 200.406, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting, or portion of a meeting to which the certification applies, setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present.

Copies of such transcript, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication, as identified on the FOIA web page of the Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov,
and, if a transcript is prepared, the actual cost of such transcription.
(b)
Review of deletion from record.
Any person who has been notified that the Freedom of Information Act Officer has determined to withhold any transcript, recording, or minute, or portion thereof, which was the subject of a request for access pursuant to § 200.402(a), or any person who has not received a response to his or her own request within the 20 days specified in § 200.408(a), may appeal the adverse determination or failure to respond by applying for an order of the Commission determining and directing that the transcript, recording or minute, or deleted portion thereof, be made available. Such application shall be in writing and should be directed to the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. The applicant shall state such facts and cite such legal or other authorities as the applicant may consider appropriate. The Commission shall make a determination with respect to any appeal pursuant to this subsection within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, or within such extended period as may be agreeable to the person making the request. The Commission may determine to withhold any record that is exempt from disclosure pursuant to § 200.402(a), although it may disclose a record, even if exempt, if, in its discretion, it determines it to be appropriate to do so.
(c)
Retention of record.

§§ 200.631-200.639
[Reserved]
§ 200.640
Employment.
No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 200.641-200.648
[Reserved]
§ 200.649
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 200.650, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 200.650
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 200.650(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods
—(1)
General.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(2)
Historic preservation programs.
In meeting the requirements of § 200.650(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 200.650(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons,
including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
§ 200.651
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 200.652-200.659
[Reserved]
§ 200.660
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 200.660 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the
benefits and services of the program or activity.

§ 200.735-4
Outside employment and activities.
(a) Members and employees shall comply with the requirements of the Supplemental standards of ethical conduct for members and employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission (codified at 5 CFR 4401.103 (Outside employment and activities) and 5 CFR part 2635, subpart H (Outside activities)).
(b) The Commission encourages employees to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing activities with or without compensation.
2
In participating in such activities, employees should be guided by the following:
2
As to employees, while the receipt of honoraria is discouraged, that rule is not applicable to the receipt of compensation for teaching.
(1) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in if prohibited by law, Executive order, Office of Personnel Management regulations, or the rules in this subpart.
(2) No teaching, lecturing, or writing should be engaged in (including for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the Office of Personnel Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service) that depends on information filed with the Commission, or obtained by the Commission in an investigation or otherwise, or generated within the Commission which is nonpublic, unless the Commission gives formal approval for the use of such nonpublic information on the basis that the use thereof is in the public interest.
3
3
Since members of the Commission are covered by section 401(a) of Executive Order 11222, they are prohibited by Civil Service Regulations (5 CFR 735.203(c)) from receiving compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of their agencies, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information.
(c) If otherwise permitted by 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205, the provisions of these rules or of 5 CFR 4401.103 do not preclude an employee from acting as agent or attorney:
(1) For any Commission employee who is sued or under investigation in connection with his or her official duties;
(2) For any Commission employee who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administrative proceedings in connection with those proceedings; or
(3) For any Commission employee who raises claims or against whom allegations of wrongdoing are made pursuant to the Commission's Equal Opportunity regulations, if such representation is not inconsistent with the faithful performance of the employee's duties.
(d)(1) As paragraph (b) of this section indicates, the Commission encourages
employees to engage in teaching, lecturing and writing activities.
4
It is understood, however, that Commission employees in their teaching, writing and lecturing shall not
4
This paragraph (d), requiring review of prepared speeches or writings relating to the Commission does not apply to teaching activities.
(i) Use confidential or nonpublic information;
(ii) Make comments on pending litigation in which the Commission is participating as a party or
amicus curiae;
or
(iii) Make comments on rulemaking proceedings pending before the Commission which would adversely affect the operations of the Commission.
(2) To assist employees in conforming to these requirements the following procedure for reviewing writings prior to publication, or prepared speeches prior to delivery, has been established:
(i) Employees must submit proposed publications or prepared speeches relating to the Commission, or the statutes or rules it administers, to the General Counsel for review. Employees will be notified as promptly as possible, with due regard to publication deadlines, but in any event within 30 days of receipt of the written document, whether such document conforms to the requirements of this Rule.
(ii)(A) A determination by the General Counsel that a proposed publication conforms to the requirements of the rule will not involve adoption of, or concurrence in, the views expressed. Therefore, such publication or speech shall include at an appropriate place or in a footnote or otherwise, the following disclaimer of responsibility:
The Securities and Exchange Commission disclaims responsibility for any private publication or statement of any SEC employee or Commissioner.
This [article, outline, speech, chapter] expresses the author's views and does not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, the [other] Commissioners, or [other] members of the staff.
(B) In appropriate cases, the above disclaimer may be modified by the General Counsel or the Commission to reflect the circumstances of an individual case. In addition, any publication or speech that reflects positions taken by the Commission shall set forth those positions accurately and, if it contains differences with Commission positions, it shall clearly state that such positions are those of the employee.
(e) With respect to host-paid travel, members and employees shall comply with the requirements of the Supplemental standards of ethical conduct for members and employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission (codified at 5 CFR 4401.103 (Outside employment and activities)); 5 CFR part 2635, subpart H (Outside Activities); and 31 U.S.C. 1353 and 41 CFR 304-1.1 (Acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel expenses).
(f)(1) With respect to seeking or negotiating outside employment, members and employees shall comply with the requirements of the Supplemental standards of ethical conduct for members and employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission (codified at 5 CFR 4401.103 (Outside employment and activities)); 5 CFR part 2635, subpart F (Seeking other employment); 5 CFR part 2635, subpart H (Outside activities).
(2) Members and employees should be aware that 18 U.S.C. 208 (Acts affecting a personal interest) provides, among other things, that a member or employee is prohibited from participating personally and substantially in any particular matter in which, to his or her knowledge, the member or employee, his or her spouse, minor child, general partner, organization of which the employee is an officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he or she is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest. This provision does not apply if the employee has received a written determination by an authorized official that the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's government service.
(3) Members may follow the procedural provision contained in Part V, Section 503 of the Executive Order 11222.
(g) An employee who intends to accept or perform any outside or private
employment or professional work shall obtain necessary authorization in advance of such acceptance or performance. A request for such authorization shall be submitted to the Division Director, Office Head or Regional Director concerned, together with all pertinent facts regarding the proposed employment, such as the name of the employer, the nature of the work to be performed, its estimated duration, and the fee or compensation to be received. Division Directors, Office Heads and Regional Directors have been delegated the authority to approve routine requests for outside employment. The approving official shall forward to the Director of Personnel a copy of each request showing the date of approval. Requests of a non-routine nature should be forwarded to the Director of Personnel.
(h) The Director of Personnel, or his designee, is authorized to approve or disapprove requests for outside or private employment under this rule, except as to those cases which, in his judgment, should be considered and decided by the Commission. An employee may appeal a disapproved request to the Commission. The written appeal, submitted through the Director of Personnel, shall give reasons why the proposed outside or private employment is consistent with this rule. The Director of Personnel may not approve proposed outside or private employment which is absolutely prohibited by these rules. The Commission may, in a particular case, approve such employment.

[75 FR 42277, July 20, 2010]
§ 200.735-8
Practice by former members and employees of the Commission.
(a) Members and employees and former members and employees shall comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 5 CFR part 2641 (Post employment conflict of interest restrictions). Members and employees and former members and employees should be aware that, among other restrictions, 18 U.S.C. 207 generally prohibits a former member or employee from knowingly communicating to or appearing before a Federal agency with the intent to influence a particular matter involving specific parties in which that person personally and substantially participated while at the Commission.
(b)(1) Any former member or employee of the Commission who, within 2 years after ceasing to be such, is employed or retained as the representative of any person outside the Government in any matter in which it is contemplated that he or she will appear before the Commission, or communicate with the Commission or its employees, shall, within ten days of such retainer or employment, or of the time when appearance before, or communication with the Commission or its employees is first contemplated, file with the Office of the Ethics Counsel a statement which includes:
(i) A description of the contemplated representation;
(ii) An affirmative representation that the former employee while on the Commission's staff had neither personal and substantial responsibility
nor official responsibility for the matter which is the subject of the representation; and
(iii) The name of the Commission Division or Office in which the person had been employed.
(2) The statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be filed electronically based on instructions provided by the Office of the Ethics Counsel at
www.sec.gov
, or filed in paper by mailing to the U.S. Securities
Exchange Commission, Office of the Ethics Counsel, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-9150.
(3) Employment of a recurrent character may be covered by a single comprehensive statement. Each such statement should include an appropriate caption indicating that it is filed pursuant to this section. The reporting requirements of this paragraph do not apply to
(i) Communications incidental to court appearances in litigation involving the Commission; and
(ii) Oral communications concerning ministerial or informational matters or requests for oral advice not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) As used in this section, the term
appear before the commission
means physical presence before the Commission or its employees in either a formal or informal setting or the conveyance of material in connection with a formal appearance or application to the Commission. As used in this section the term
communication with intent to influence
does not encompass communications which are not for the purpose of influencing the Commission or any of its employees or which, at the time of the filings, are reasonably believed not to involve any potential controversy. As used in this section, the term
representative
or
representative capacity
shall include not only the usual type of representation by an attorney, etc., but also representation of a corporation in the capacity of an officer, director or controlling stockholder thereof.
(d)(1) Partners or associates of any person disqualified from appearing or practicing before the Commission in a particular matter are also disqualified. Such partners or associates (the
firm
) may request a waiver of this prohibition from the Commission by writing a letter to the General Counsel of the commission setting forth the facts of the proposed representation and the individual's disqualification. In appropriate situations, a firm may request a generic waiver with respect to a number of different matters. Upon the advice of the Office of the General Counsel, the Commission, or the General Counsel exercising delegated authority, will advise the requestor of the Commission's response.
(2) Waivers ordinarily will be granted where the firm makes a satisfactory representation that it has adopted screening measures which will effectively isolate the individual lawyer disqualified from participating in the particular matter or matters and from sharing in any fees attributable to it. It will be considered significant for purposes of this determination that:
(i) The firm had a pre-existing securities law practice prior to the arrival of the disqualified attorney;
(ii) The matter was previously the subject of consideration by the firm or the client was already advised by the firm;
(iii) In cases where the matter or client became the subject of consideration by the firm subsequent to the firm's employment of the lawyer individually disqualified, that the matter was not brought to the firm because of the disqualified attorney.
(3) Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of any of these factors, no waiver will be issued if the proposed representation would create a significant appearance of impropriety or would otherwise adversely affect the interests of the government.
5
All proceedings with respect to waivers shall be a matter of public record except to the extent that such public disclosure
might violate attorney-client privilege or breach the attorney's obligation to preserve the confidences and secrets of this or her clients, reveal the existence of ongoing private investigations, interfere with law enforcement proceedings, or otherwise be inconsistent with the public interest.
5
For example, no waiver will be granted if, during the course of representing a client who has an interest with respect to a matter before the Commission, a firm employs, or accepts as a partner, a member of the staff or of the Commission who at any time during the course of that representation had direct and substantial responsibility for the same matter, and whose departure would result in a significant adverse impact upon that matter at the Commission.
(e) Persons in doubt as to the applicability of any portion of this section may apply for an advisory ruling of the Commission.

§ 200.735-11
Statement of employment and financial interests.
(a) Members and employees shall file financial disclosure reports in accordance with the requirements of 5 CFR part 2634 (Executive branch financial disclosure).
(b) Prior to the time of entry on duty, or upon designation to a position set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, such employee shall submit to the Director of Personnel a statement, on the official form made available for this purpose through the Office of Personnel, setting forth the following information:
(1) A list of the names of all corporations, companies, firms, or other business enterprises, partnerships, nonprofit organizations, and educational or other institutions with or in which the employee, his or her spouse, unemancipated minor child or other member of his or her immediate household has—
(i) Any connection as an employee, officer, owner, director, member, trustee, partner, adviser or consultant; or
(ii) Any continuing financial interest, through a pension or retirement plan, shared income, or other arrangement as a result of any current or prior employment or business or professional association.
(iii) Any financial interest through the ownership of stock, stock options, bonds, securities, or other arrangements including trusts.
(2) A list of the names of the employee's creditors and the creditors of his or her spouse, unemancipated minor child or other member of his or her immediate household, other than those creditors to whom any such person may be indebted by reason of a mortgage on property which he or she occupies as a personal residence, or to whom such person may be indebted for current and ordinary household and living expenses such as those incurred for household furnishings, vacations, an automobile, education, or the like.
(3) A list of the employee's interests and those of his or her spouse, unemancipated minor child, or other member of his or her immediate household in real property or rights in lands, other than property which he or she occupies as a personal residence.
(4) For the purpose of this section,
member of his or her immediate household
means a resident of the employee's household who is related to the employee by blood or marriage.
(5) In the instance where a spouse is not a
member of the employee's immediate household,
and the employee certifies he or she neither derives nor expects to derive any economic benefit from the holdings of the spouse, the Director of Personnel may waive the requirement of reporting the interests of such spouse.
(c) Statements of employment and financial interests filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be
sent to the Ethics Office in a sealed envelope marked “Confidential Employment and Financial Interests.” They shall be maintained in a confidential file. Only those officials of the Commission whose participation is necessary for the carrying out of the purpose of this Conduct Regulation may have access to such statements and no information may be disclosed from them except as the Commission or the Office of Personnel Management may determine for good cause shown.
(d) In accordance with the requirements of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-521, the Ethics Office shall review the financial disclosure reports filed pursuant to that Act.
(e) The Ethics Office shall examine the statements of employment and financial interests filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to determine whether conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of employees exist. An employee shall be afforded the opportunity to explain any conflict or appearance of conflict. When the Director or Assistant Director of Personnel, in consultation with appropriate superiors of the employee involved, is unable to resolve a conflict or appearance of conflict, he or she shall report the matter to the Commission through the Counselor for the Commission designated under § 200.735-15(a).
(f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section the statement of employment and financial interests and supplementary statements required of employees are in addition to, and not in substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement imposed by law, order or regulation. The submission of a statement by an employee does not permit him or her or any other person to participate in a matter in which his or her or the other person's participation is prohibited by law, order or regulation.
(g) An employee has the right to ask for a review through the Commission's grievance procedure outlined in section 771, Part II, Manual of Administrative Regulations, of a complaint that his or her position has been improperly included under the provisions of this section as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and financial interests.

Special Government employees.
(a) Special Government employee means a person defined in section 18 U.S.C. 202 as a
special Government employee.
All of the provisions of this Conduct Regulation are applicable to special Government employees, except that in specific appropriate cases the Commission may exempt such employees from, or modify the applicability of, any portion of any provision of the Conduct Regulation.
(b) In no event will the Commission waive a provision of the Conduct Regulation which would permit a special Government employee to:
(1) Use his or her Government employment for a purpose that is, or gives the appearance of being, motivated by the desire for private gain for himself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties.
(2) Use inside information obtained as a result of his or her Government employment for private gain for himself or herself or another person either by direct action on his or her part or by counsel, recommendation, or suggestion to another person, particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties. For purposes of this paragraph,
inside information
means information obtained under Government authority which has not become part of the body of public information.
(3) Use his or her Government employment to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, a person to provide financial benefit to himself or herself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has family, business, or financial ties.
(4) Receive or solicit from a person having business with the Commission anything of value as a gift, gratuity, loan, entertainment, or favor for himself or herself or another person, particularly one with whom he or she has family, business or financial ties.

L. 95-521. It shall be kept current throughout the period of employment by the filing of supplementary statements in accordance with the requirements of § 200.735-11(d). Statements shall be on the official form made available for this purpose through the Office of Personnel.

consultant
or an
expert,
as those terms are defined in chapter 304 of the Federal Personnel Manual (5 CFR 735.304), if the duties of the position are determined to be at a level of responsibility which does not require the submission of such statement to protect the integrity of the Commission.
§ 200.735-13
Disciplinary and other remedial action.
(a) Knowing participation in a violation of this subpart by persons not within the scope of the foregoing rules in this subpart shall likewise be deemed improper conduct and in contravention of Commission rules. Departure from any of the rules in this subpart by employees or special Government employees without specific approval may be cause for appropriate remedial and/or disciplinary action or, in the case of former members, employees, and special Government employees, for disqualification from appearing and practicing before the Commission, which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.
(b) When there has been a departure from any of the rules of this subpart without specific approval or when a conflict of interest or an apparent conflict of interest on the part of an employee or special Government employee arises, the Director of Personnel may order immediate action to end such conflict or appearance of conflict of interest. Remedial action may include, but is not limited to (1) changes in assigned duties; (2) divestment by the employee or special Government employee of his conflicting interest; (3) disciplinary action; or (4) disqualification for a particular assignment. Remedial action, whether disciplinary or otherwise, shall be effected in accordance with any applicable laws, Executive Orders, and regulations. The Director of Personnel may refer any recommended action to the Commission. The employee may obtain review by the Commission of any action ordered to be taken by the Director of Personnel. During the period of review, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, the action ordered by the Director of Personnel is stayed.
(c) Former members or employees who violate the post-employment restriction provisions of 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c), which parallel the provisions of Rule 8(a),
supra,
will be subject to an administrative enforcement proceeding as set forth in Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, § 201.102(e) of this chapter, except that, when proceedings are brought to determine if violations of post-employment restrictions have occurred, denial of the privilege of appearing and practicing before the Commission will be based on a finding of violation of the provisions of Rule 8(a) and 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) and (c). Procedures applicable to such administrative proceedings are to be found in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.100
et seq.

# Subpart B—Regulations Pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act
§ 201.31
Purpose of these rules.
The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called
the Act
in this subpart B), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called
adversary adjudications
) before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use in ruling on those applications.
[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.32
When the Act applies.
The Act applies to adversary adjudications described in § 201.33 pending or commenced before the Commission on or after August 5, 1985. It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in these rules, has been filed with the Commission within 30 days after August 5, 1985. Proceedings which have been substantially concluded are not deemed pending under these rules although officially pending for purposes such as concluding remedial actions found in Commission orders or private undertakings.
[54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.33
Proceedings covered.
(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission. These are on the record adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of an Office or Division of the Commission as a party, not including
amicus
participation, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding.
See
appendix, 17 CFR 201.60.
(b) The fact that the Commission has not identified a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.
(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.34
Eligibility of applicants.
(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks it seeks an award. The term
party
is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart.
(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;
(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with more than 500 employees; and
(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a new worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.
(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an
individual
rather than a
sole owner of an unincorporated business
if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.
(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this subpart, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

§ 201.35
Standards for awards.
(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Office or Division over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the Office or Division includes, in addition to the position taken by the Office or Division in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Office or Division upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an
award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on counsel for an Office or Division of the Commission, which must show that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.36
Allowable fees and expenses.
(a) Subject to the limitation of paragraph (b), awards will be based on rates customarily charged, in the locale of the hearing, by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.
(b) No award of the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the reasonable rate at which the Commission pays witnesses with similar expertise. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall consider the following:
(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant the fully allocated cost of the services;
(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.
(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.37
Delegations of authority.
(a) The Commission may by order delegate authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act in particular cases.
(b) Unless the Commission shall order otherwise, applications for awards of fees and expenses made pursuant to this subject shall be assigned by the Chief Administrative Law Judge to an administrative law judge for determination.

§ 201.41
Contents of application.
(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant, the proceeding for which an award is sought and contain the information required in this subpart. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and specify the position(s) of the opposing Office or Division in the proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
(d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.
(e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.42
Net worth exhibit.
(a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 201.34(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The administrative law judge or the Commission may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that exhibit in accordance with 17 CFR 201.190.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]
§ 201.43
Documentation of fees and expenses.
The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The applicant may be required to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses claimed.
§ 201.44
When an application may be filed.
(a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the proceeding.
(b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the Commission and to the courts.
(c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53052, Dec. 27, 1989]
§ 201.51
Filing and service of documents.
Any application for an award or other document related to an application shall be filed and served in the same manner as other papers in proceedings under the Commission's Rules of Practice. In addition, a copy of each application for fees and expenses shall
be served on the General Counsel of the Commission.
§ 201.52
Answer to application.
(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the Office or Division of the Commission may file an answer to the application. Unless the Office or Division of the Commission counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
(b) If counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
(c) The answer shall explain any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of that position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, it shall include supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 201.55.
§ 201.53
Reply.
Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 201.55.
§ 201.54
Settlement.
The applicant and counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with the Commission's standard settlement procedure. See 17 CFR 201.240. If a prevailing party and counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement provides that each side shall bear its own expenses, and the settlement is accepted, no application may be filed.
[54 FR 53052, Dec. 27, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]
§ 201.55
Further proceedings.
(a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission, or on his or her own initiative, the administrative law judge may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses) an evidentiary hearing. The administrative law judge may order all proceedings that are otherwise available under § 201.221 and § 201.222(a). Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the Commission's position was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.
(b) A request for further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53052, Dec. 27, 1989; 70 FR 72569, Dec. 5, 2005]
§ 201.56
Decision.
The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the application promptly after completion of proceedings on the application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for
any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
§ 201.57
Commission review.
In accordance with the procedures set forth in 17 CFR 201.410 and 201.411, either the applicant or counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Commission may decide to review the decision on its own initiative. If neither the applicant nor counsel for the Division or Office of the Commission seeks review and the Commission does not take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken, the Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.
[47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 60 FR 32795, June 23, 1995]
§ 201.58
Judicial review.
Judicial review of final Commission decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).
§ 201.59
Payment of award.
An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the Chief Financial Officer of the Commission a copy of the Commission's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a sworn statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. The Commission will pay the amount awarded to the applicant as authorized by law, unless judicial review of the award has been sought by the applicant.

—(1)
Generally.

(i) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; or
(ii) To be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; or
(iii) To have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.
(iv) With respect to persons licensed to practice as accountants, “improper professional conduct” under § 201.102(e)(1)(ii) means:
(A) Intentional or knowing conduct, including reckless conduct, that results in a violation of applicable professional standards; or

) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted.
(
2
) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission.
(2)
Certain professionals and convicted persons.
Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court of the United States or of any State; or any person whose license to practice as an accountant, engineer, or other professional or expert has been revoked or suspended in any State; or any person who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission. A disbarment, suspension, revocation or conviction within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending, revoking or convicting agency or tribunal enters its judgment or order, including a judgment or order on a plea of nolo contendere, regardless of whether an appeal of such judgment or order is pending or could be taken.
(3)
Temporary suspensions.
An order of temporary suspension shall become effective upon service on the respondent. No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section more than 90 days after the date on which the final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section has become effective, whether upon completion of review or appeal procedures or because further review or appeal procedures are no longer available.
(i) The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any attorney, accountant, engineer, or other professional or expert who has been by name:
(A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder; or
(B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the Commission to which he or she is a party or found by the Commission in any administrative proceeding to which he or she is a party to have violated (unless the violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.
(ii) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section may, within 30 days after service upon him or her of the order of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30 days after service of the order, the suspension shall become permanent.
(iii) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing at a time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after opportunity for hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of
time or permanently. In every case in which the temporary suspension has not been lifted, every hearing held and other action taken pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be expedited in accordance with § 201.500. If the hearing is held before a hearing officer, the time limits set forth in § 201.540 will govern review of the hearing officer's initial decision.
(iv) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the staff of the Commission shall show either that the petitioner has been enjoined as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section or that the petitioner has been found to have committed or aided and abetted violations as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section and that showing, without more, may be the basis for censure or disqualification. Once that showing has been made, the burden shall be upon the petitioner to show cause why he or she should not be censured or temporarily or permanently disqualified from appearing and practicing before the Commission. In any such hearing, the petitioner may not contest any finding made against him or her or fact admitted by him or her in the judicial or administrative proceeding upon which the proceeding under this paragraph (e)(3) is predicated. A person who has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall be presumed for all purposes under this paragraph (e)(3) to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.
(4)

The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday (as defined in § 201.104), in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this section. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
(b)
Additional time for service by mail.
If service is made by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response unless an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date certain for filing. In the event that an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date certain for filing, no time shall be added for service by mail.

§ 201.161
Extensions of time, postponements and adjournments.
(a)
Availability.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Commission, at any time, or the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of his or her initial decision or, if no initial decision is to be filed, at any time prior to the closing of the record, may, for good cause shown, extend or shorten any time limits prescribed by these Rules of Practice for the filing of any papers and may, consistent with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, postpone or adjourn any hearing.
(b)
Considerations in determining whether to extend time limits or grant postponements, adjournments and extensions.
(1) In considering all motions or requests pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Commission or the hearing officer should adhere to a policy of strongly disfavoring such requests, except in circumstances where the requesting party makes a strong showing that the denial of the request or motion would substantially prejudice their case. In determining whether to grant any requests, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors:
(i) The length of the proceeding to date;
(ii) The number of postponements, adjournments or extensions already granted;
(iii) The stage of the proceedings at the time of the request;
(iv) The impact of the request on the hearing officer's ability to complete the proceeding in the time specified by the Commission; and
(v) Any other such matters as justice may require.
(2) To the extent that the Commission has chosen a timeline under which the hearing would occur beyond the statutory 60-day deadline, this policy of strongly disfavoring requests for postponement will not apply to a request by a respondent to postpone commencement of a cease and desist proceeding hearing beyond the statutory 60-day period.
(c)(1)
Time limit.
Postponements, adjournments or extensions of time for filing papers shall not exceed 21 days unless the Commission or the hearing officer states on the record or sets forth in a written order the reasons why a longer period of time is necessary.
(2)
Stay pending Commission consideration of offers of settlement.
(i) If the Commission staff and one or more respondents in the proceeding file a joint motion notifying the hearing officer that they have agreed in principle to a settlement on all major terms, then the hearing officer shall stay the proceeding as to the settling respondent(s), or in the discretion of the hearing officer as to all respondents, pending completion of Commission consideration of the settlement offer. Any such stay will be contingent upon:
(A) The settling respondent(s) submitting to the Commission staff, within fifteen business days of the stay, a signed offer of settlement in conformance with § 201.240; and
(B) Within twenty business days of receipt of the signed offer, the staff submitting the settlement offer and accompanying recommendation to the Commission for consideration.
(ii) If the parties fail to meet either of these deadlines or if the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the hearing officer must be promptly notified and, upon notification of the hearing officer, the stay shall lapse and the proceeding will continue. In the circumstance where:
(A) A hearing officer has granted a stay because the parties have “agreed in principle to a settlement;”
(B) The agreement in principle does not materialize into a signed settlement offer within 15 business days of the stay; and
(C) The stay lapses, the hearing officer will not be required to grant another stay related to the settlement process until both parties have notified the hearing officer in writing that a signed settlement offer has been prepared, received by the Commission's staff, and will be submitted to the Commission.
(iii) The granting of any stay pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall stay the timeline pursuant to § 201.360(a).
[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 68 FR 35788, June 17, 2003; 81 FR 50234, July 29, 2016]
§ 201.180
Sanctions.
(a)
Contemptuous conduct
—(1)
Subject to exclusion or suspension.
Contemptuous conduct by any person before the Commission or a hearing officer during any proceeding, including at or in connection with any conference, deposition or hearing, shall be grounds for the Commission or the hearing officer to:
(i) Exclude that person from such deposition, hearing or conference, or any portion thereof; and/or
(ii) Summarily suspend that person from representing others in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.
(2)
Review procedure.
A person excluded from a deposition, hearing or conference, or a counsel summarily suspended from practice for the duration or any portion of a proceeding, may seek review of the exclusion or suspension by filing with the Commission, within three days of the exclusion or suspension order, a motion to vacate the order. The Commission shall consider such motion on an expedited basis as provided in § 201.500.
(3)
Adjournment.
Upon motion by a party represented by counsel subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be granted to allow
the retention of new counsel. In determining the length of an adjournment, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in § 201.161, the availability of co-counsel for the party or of other members of a suspended counsel's firm.
(b)
Deficient filings; leave to cure deficiencies.
The Commission or the hearing officer may reject, in whole or in part, any filing that fails to comply with any requirements of these Rules of Practice or of any order issued in the proceeding in which the filing was made. Any such filings shall not be part of the record. The Commission or the hearing officer may direct a party to cure any deficiencies and to resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.
(c)
Failure to make required filing or to cure deficient filing.
The Commission or the hearing officer may enter a default pursuant to § 201.155, dismiss one or more claims, decide the particular claim(s) at issue against that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that claim if a person fails:
(1) To make a filing required under these Rules of Practice; or
(2) To cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the Commission or the hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

Procedure for supplying additional information.
The applicant may be required to furnish in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for objection to public disclosure. Failure to supply the information so requested within 14 days from the date of receipt by the applicant of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion of the information to which the additional information relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
(c)
Confidentiality of materials pending final decision.
Pending the determination of the application for confidential treatment, transcripts, non-final orders including an initial decision, if any, and other materials in connection with the application shall be placed under seal; shall be for the confidential use only of the hearing officer, the Commission, the applicant, and any other parties and counsel; and shall be made available to the public only in accordance with orders of the Commission.
(d)

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 71875, Nov. 21, 2011]
§ 201.191
Adjudications not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.
(a)
Scope of the rule.
This rule applies to every case of adjudication, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, pursuant to any statute which the Commission administers, where adjudication is not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and which the Commission has not chosen to determine on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.
(b)
Procedure.
In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of this
section, the Commission shall give prompt notice of any adverse action or final disposition to any person who has requested the Commission to make (or not to make) any such adjudication, and furnish to any such person a written statement of reasons therefor. Additional procedures may be specified in rules relating to specific types of such adjudications. Where any such rule provides for the publication of a Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be deemed to be given by such publication.
(c)
Contents of the record.
If the Commission provides notice and opportunity for the submission of written comments by parties to the adjudication or, as the case may be, by other interested persons, written comments received on or before the closing date for comments, unless accorded confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, become a part of the record of the adjudication. The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the record written comments filed with the Commission after the closing date.
§ 201.192

(a)
By petition.
Any person desiring the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule of general application may file a petition therefor with the Secretary. Such petition shall include a statement setting forth the text or the substance of any proposed rule or amendment desired or specifying the rule the repeal of which is desired, and stating the nature of his or her interest and his or her reasons for seeking the issuance, amendment or repeal of the rule. The Secretary shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the petition and refer it to the appropriate division or office for consideration and recommendation. Such recommendations shall be transmitted with the petition to the Commission for such action as the Commission deems appropriate. The Secretary shall notify the petitioner of the action taken by the Commission.
(b)
Notice of proposed issuance, amendment or repeal of rules.
Except where the Commission finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, whenever the Commission proposes to issue, amend, or repeal any rule or regulation of general application other than an interpretive rule; general statement of policy; or rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts, there shall first be published in the
Federal Register
a notice of the proposed action. Such notice shall include:
(1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking proceeding, with particular reference to the manner in which interested persons shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in such proceeding;
(2) Reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and

§ 201.193
Applications by barred individuals for consent to associate.
(a)
Preliminary note.
This section governs applications to the Commission by certain persons, barred by Commission order from association with brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers, government securities dealers, investment advisers, investment companies or transfer agents, for consent to become so associated. Applications made pursuant to this section must show that the proposed association would be consistent with the public interest. In addition to the information specifically required by the section, applications should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written statements of individuals (other than the applicant) who are competent to attest to the applicant's character, employment performance, and other relevant information. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001
et seq.
and other provisions of law.
(1) The nature of the supervision that an applicant will receive or exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting
the burden of showing that the proposed association is consistent with the public interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the proposed supervision, procedures, or terms and conditions of employment are reasonably designed to prevent a recurrence of the conduct that led to imposition of the bar. As an associated person, the applicant will be limited to association in a specified capacity with a particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions.
(2) Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that the proposed association is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the applicant is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, another barred individual. In addition, where an applicant wishes to become the sole proprietor of a registered entity and thus is seeking Commission consent notwithstanding an absence of supervision, the applicant's burden will be difficult to meet.
(3) In addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the Commission will consider the nature of the findings that resulted in the bar when making its determination as to whether the proposed association is consistent with the public interest. In this regard, attention is directed to § 202.5(e) of the Commission's Rules on Informal and Other Procedures, 17 CFR 202.5(e). Among other things, § 202.5(e) sets forth the Commission's policy “not to permit a * * * respondent [in an administrative proceeding] to consent to * * * [an] order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the * * * order for proceedings.” Consistent with the rationale underlying that policy, and in order to avoid the appearance that an application made pursuant to this section was granted on the basis of such denial, the Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the Commission's bar order.
(b)
Scope of rule.
Applications for Commission consent to associate, or to change the terms and conditions of association, with a registered broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, investment adviser, investment company or transfer agent may be made pursuant to this section where a Commission order bars the individual from association with a registered entity and:
(1) Such barred individual seeks to become associated with an entity that is not a member of a self-regulatory organization; or
(2) The order contains a proviso that application may be made to the Commission after a specified period of time.
(c)
Form of application.
Each application shall be supported by an affidavit, signed by the applicant, that addresses the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The application shall be filed pursuant to §§ 201.151, 152 and 153. Each application shall include as exhibits:
(1) A copy of the Commission order imposing the bar;
(2) An undertaking by the applicant to notify immediately the Commission in writing if any information submitted in support of the application becomes materially false or misleading while the application is pending;
(3) The following forms, as appropriate:
(i) A copy of a completed Form U-4, where the applicant's proposed association is with a broker-dealer or municipal securities dealer;
(ii) A copy of a completed Form MSD-4, where the applicant's proposed association is with a bank municipal securities dealer;
(iii) The information required by Form ADV, 17 CFR 279.1, with respect to the applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is with an investment adviser;
(iv) The information required by Form TA-1, 17 CFR 249b.100, with respect to the applicant, where the applicant's proposed association is with a transfer agent; and
(4) A written statement by the proposed employer that describes:
(i) The terms and conditions of employment and supervision to be exercised over such applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
(ii) The qualifications, experience, and disciplinary records of the proposed supervisor(s) of the applicant;
(iii) The compliance and disciplinary history, during the two years preceding
the filing of the application, of the office in which the applicant will be employed; and
(iv) The names of any other associated persons in the same office who have previously been barred by the Commission, and whether they are to be supervised by the applicant.
(d)
Required showing.
The applicant shall make a showing satisfactory to the Commission that the proposed association would be consistent with the public interest.
(e)
Factors to be addressed.
The affidavit required by paragraph (b) of this section shall address each of the following:
(1) The time period since the imposition of the bar;
(2) Any restitution or similar action taken by the applicant to recompense any person injured by the misconduct that resulted in the bar;
(3) The applicant's compliance with the order imposing the bar;
(4) The applicant's employment during the period subsequent to imposition of the bar;
(5) The capacity or position in which the applicant proposes to be associated;
(6) The manner and extent of supervision to be exercised over such applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
(7) Any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions completed by the applicant subsequent to imposition of the bar to prepare for his or her return to the securities business; and
(8) Any other information material to the application.
(f)
Notification to applicant and written statement.
In the event an adverse recommendation is proposed by the staff with respect to an application made pursuant to this section, the applicant shall be so advised and provided with a written statement of the reasons for such recommendation. The applicant shall then have 30 days to submit a written statement in response.
(g)
Concurrent applications.
The Commission will not consider any application submitted pursuant to this section if any other application for consent to associate concerning the same applicant is pending before any self-regulatory organization.

(b)

(c)

A security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be excluded from the prohibition in section 15F(b)(6) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)) with respect to an associated person who is a natural person who (i) is not a U.S. person (as defined in 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(A)) and (ii) does not effect and is not involved in effecting security-based swap transactions with or for counterparties that are U.S. persons (as defined in 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)), other than a security-based swap transaction conducted through a foreign branch (as that term is defined in 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(3)) of a counterparty that is a U.S. person;
provided, however,
that this exclusion shall not be available if the associated person of that security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is currently subject to any order described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, with the limitation that an order by a foreign financial regulatory authority described in subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(iii) of section 3(a)(39) (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(B)(i) and (B)(iii)) shall only apply to orders by a foreign financial regulatory authority in the jurisdiction where the associated person is employed or located.
(d)
Form of application.
Each application with respect to an associated person that is a natural person who is subject to a statutory disqualification shall be supported by a written statement, signed by a knowledgeable person authorized by the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, which addresses the items set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

(e)
Written statement.

(10) Whether the associated person has been involved in any litigation during the five years preceding the filing of the application concerning investment or investment-related activities or whether there are any unsatisfied judgments outstanding against the associated person concerning investment or investment-related activities, to the extent not otherwise covered by paragraph (e)(9) of this section.

(ii) The terms and conditions of the association with the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant are the same in all material respects as those approved in connection with a previous order, notice or other applicable document granting the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, as provided in paragraph (h)(1); and
(iii) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has filed a notice with the Commission. The notice shall be filed pursuant to Rules of Practice 151, 152, and 153 (17 CFR 201.151, 201.152, and 201.153). The notice must set forth, as appropriate:
(A) The name of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;
(B) The name of the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification;
(C) The name of the associated person's prospective supervisor(s) at the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;
(D) The place of employment for the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification; and
(E) Identification of any agency, self-regulatory organization (as provided in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)) or a registered futures association (as provided in 7 U.S.C. 21) that has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed association, registration or listing as a principal.
(i)
Note to § 201.194.
(1) Under Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)), except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, it shall be unlawful for a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant to permit any person associated with a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, if the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the statutory disqualification.
(2) Subject to the exclusion provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in accordance with the authority granted in Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)), this section governs applications to the Commission by a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant for the Commission to issue an order to permit a natural person who is an associated person of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security- based swap participant.
(3) Applications made pursuant to this section must show that it would be consistent with the public interest to permit the associated person of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. In addition to the information specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written statements of individuals who are competent to attest to the associated person's character, employment performance, and other relevant information. In addition to the information required by the rule, the Commission staff may request supplementary information to assist in the Commission's review. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001,
et seq.
and other provisions of law. The Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the statutory disqualification.
(4) The nature of the supervision that an associated person will receive or exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting the burden of showing that permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the terms or conditions of association, procedures or proposed supervision, are reasonably designed to ensure that the statutory disqualification does not negatively affect the ability of the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant in compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory framework.
(5) Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the associated person is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, another statutorily disqualified individual. In addition, where there is an absence of supervision over the associated person
who is subject to a statutory disqualification, the applicant's burden will be difficult to meet. The associated person may be limited to association in a specified capacity with a particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions.

§ 201.210
Parties, limited participants and amici curiae.
(a)
Parties in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a self- regulatory organization determination, a proceeding to review a Board determination, or a proceeding to review a determination by a security-based swap execution facility
—(1)
Generally.
No person shall be granted leave to become a party or a non-party participant on a limited basis in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a determination by a self- regulatory organization pursuant to §§ 201.420 and 201.421, a proceeding to review a determination by the Board pursuant to §§ 201.440 and 201.441, or a proceeding to review a determination by a security-based swap execution facility pursuant to §§ 201.442 and 201.443, except as authorized by paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Disgorgement proceedings.
In an enforcement proceeding, a person may state his or her views with respect to a proposed plan of disgorgement or file a proof of claim pursuant to § 201.1103.
(b)
Intervention as party
—(1)
Generally.
In any proceeding, other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, a proceeding to review a Board determination, or a proceeding to review a security-based swap execution facility determination, any person may seek leave to intervene as a party by filing a motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding. No person,
however, shall be admitted as a party to a proceeding by intervention unless it is determined that leave to participate pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section would be inadequate for the protection of the person's interests. In a proceeding under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any representative of interested security holders, or any other person whose participation in the proceeding may be in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of a written motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.
(2)
Intervention as of right.
In proceedings under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any interested State or State agency shall be admitted as a party to any proceeding upon the filing of a written motion requesting leave to be admitted.
(c)
Leave to participate on a limited basis.
In any proceeding, other than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a self-regulatory determination, a proceeding to review a Board determination, or a proceeding to review a security-based swap execution facility determination, any person may seek leave to participate on a limited basis as a non-party participant as any matter affecting the person's interests:
(1)
Procedure.
Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing, shall set forth the nature and extent of the movant's interest in the proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is shown, shall be filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the commencement of the hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) may include such rights of a party as the hearing officer may deem appropriate. Persons granted leave to participate shall be served in accordance with § 201.150; provided, however, that a party to the proceeding may move that the extent of notice of filings or other papers to be provided to persons granted leave to participate be limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to participate bear the cost of being provided copies of any or all filings or other papers. Persons granted leave to participate shall be bound, except as may be otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation between the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including submission of evidence, substitution of exhibits, corrections of the record, the time within which briefs or exceptions may be filed or proposed findings and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of initial decisions, the procedure to be followed in the preparation of decisions and the effective date of the Commission's order in the case. Where the filing of briefs or exceptions or the submission of proposed findings and conclusions are waived by the parties to the proceedings, a person granted leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not be permitted to file a brief or exceptions or submit proposed findings and conclusions except by leave of the Commission or of the hearing officer.
(2)
Certain persons entitled to leave to participate.
The hearing officer is directed to grant leave to participate under this paragraph (c) to any person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, where the Commission is authorized to approve the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.
(3)
Leave to participate in certain Commission proceedings by a representative of the United States Department of Justice, a United States Attorney's Office, or a criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or any other political subdivision of a State.
The Commission or the hearing officer may grant leave to participate on a limited basis to an authorized representative of the United States Department of Justice, an authorized representative of a United States Attorney, or an authorized representative of any criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or any other political subdivision of a State for the purpose of requesting a stay during the pendency of a criminal investigation or prosecution arising out of the same or similar facts that are at issue in the pending Commission enforcement or disciplinary proceeding. Upon a showing that such a stay is in the public interest or
for the protection of investors, the motion for stay shall be favored. A stay granted under this paragraph (c)(3) may be granted for such a period and upon such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate.
(d)
Amicus participation
—(1)
Availability.
An amicus brief may be filed only if:
(i) A motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;
(ii) The brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;
(iii) The brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the hearing officer; or
(iv) The brief is presented by the United States or an officer or agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth.
(2)
Procedure.
An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the amicus will support, unless the Commission or hearing officer, for cause shown, grants leave for a later filing. In the event that a later filing is allowed, the order granting leave to file shall specify when an opposing party may reply to the brief. A motion of an amicus curiae to participate in oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary reasons.
(e)
Permission to state views.
Any person may make a motion seeking leave to file a memorandum or make an oral statement of his or her views. Any such communication may be included in the record; provided, however, that unless offered and admitted as evidence of the truth of the statements therein made, any assertions of fact submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e) will be considered only to the extent that the statements therein made are otherwise supported by the record.
(f)
Modification of participation provisions.
The Commission or the hearing officer may, by order, modify the provisions of this section which would otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms and conditions on the participation of any person in any proceeding as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest.
[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 63405, Nov. 13, 1998; 69 FR 13177, Mar. 19, 2004; 70 FR 72570, Dec. 5, 2005; 76 FR 71875, Nov. 21, 2011; 88 FR 87282, Dec. 15, 2023]
§ 201.220
Answer to allegations.
(a)
When required.
In its order instituting proceedings, the Commission may require any respondent to file an answer to each of the allegations contained therein. Even if not so ordered, any respondent in any proceeding may elect to file an answer. Any other person granted leave by the Commission or the hearing officer to participate on a limited basis in such proceedings pursuant to § 201.210(c) may be required to file an answer.
(b)
When to file.
Except where a different period is provided by rule or by order, a respondent required to file an answer as provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall do so within 20 days after service upon the respondent of the order instituting proceedings. Persons granted leave to participate on a limited basis in the proceeding pursuant to § 201.210(c) may file an answer within a reasonable time, as determined by the Commission or the hearing officer. If the order instituting proceedings is amended, the Commission or the hearing officer may require that an amended answer be filed and, if such an answer is required, shall specify a date for the filing thereof.
(c)
Contents; effect of failure to deny.
Unless otherwise directed by the hearing officer or the Commission, an answer shall specifically admit, deny, or state that the party does not have, and is unable to obtain, sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the order instituting proceedings. When a party intends in good faith to deny only a part of an allegation, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of a lack of information shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed admitted. A respondent must affirmatively state in the answer any avoidance or affirmative defense, including but not limited to res judicata
and statute of limitations. In this regard, a respondent must state in the answer whether the respondent relied on the advice of counsel, accountants, auditors, or other professionals in connection with any claim, violation alleged or remedy sought. Failure to do so may be deemed a waiver.
(d)
Motion for more definite statement.
A respondent may file with an answer a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of fact or law to be considered or determined. Such motion shall state the respects in which, and the reasons why, each such matter of fact or law should be required to be made more definite. If the motion is granted, the order granting such motion shall set the periods for filing such a statement and any answer thereto.
(e)
Amendments.
A respondent may amend its answer at any time by written consent of each adverse party or with leave of the Commission or the hearing officer. Leave shall be freely granted when justice so requires.
(f)
Failure to file answer: Default.
If a respondent fails to file an answer required by this section within the time provided, such respondent may be deemed in default pursuant to § 201.155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to § 201.155(b).
[81 FR 50234, July 29, 2016]
§ 201.221
Prehearing conference.
(a)
Purposes of conference.
The purposes of a prehearing conference include, but are not limited to:

(3) Improving the quality of the hearing through more thorough preparation.
(b)

Where such a conference is held outside the presence of the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall be advised promptly by the parties of any agreements reached. Such conferences also may be held with one or more persons participating by telephone or other remote means.

At a prehearing conference consideration may be given and action taken with respect to any and all of the following:

(14) Depositions to be conducted, if any, and date by which depositions shall be completed; and
(15) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious disposition of the proceeding.
(d)
Required prehearing conference.
Except where the emergency nature of a proceeding would make a prehearing conference clearly inappropriate, at least one prehearing conference should be held.
(e)
Prehearing orders.
At or following the conclusion of any conference held pursuant to this section, the hearing officer shall enter a ruling or order which recites the agreements reached and any procedural determinations made by the hearing officer.
(f)
Failure to appear: default.
Any person who is named in an order instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person or through a representative, at a prehearing conference of which he or she has been duly notified may be deemed in default pursuant to § 201.155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to § 201.155(b).
[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 63405, Nov. 13, 1998; 81 FR 50234, July 29, 2016]

[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 81 FR 50235, July 29, 2016]
§ 201.230
Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Availability of documents for inspection and copying.
For purposes of this section, the term
documents
shall include writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings and other data compilations, including data stored by computer, from which information can be obtained.
(a)
Documents to be available for inspection and copying.
(1) Unless otherwise provided by this section, or by order of the Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall make available for inspection and copying by any party documents obtained by the Division prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the investigation leading to the Division's recommendation to institute proceedings. Such documents shall include:
(i) Each subpoena issued;
(ii) Every other written request to persons not employed by the Commission to provide documents or to be interviewed;
(iii) The documents turned over in response to any such subpoenas or other written requests;
(iv) All transcripts and transcript exhibits;
(v) Any other documents obtained from persons not employed by the Commission; and
(vi) Any final examination or inspection reports prepared by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, the Division of Trading and Markets, or the Division of Investment Management, if the Division of Enforcement intends either to introduce any such report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the recollection of any witness.
(2) Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall limit the right of the Division to make available any other document, or shall limit the right of a respondent to seek access to or production pursuant to subpoena of any other document, or shall limit the authority of the hearing officer to order the production of any document pursuant to subpoena.
(b)
Documents that may be withheld or redacted.
(1) The Division of Enforcement may withhold a document if:
(i) The document is privileged;
(ii) The document is an internal memorandum, note or writing prepared by a Commission employee, other than an examination or inspection report as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, or is otherwise attorney work product and will not be offered in evidence;
(iii) The document would disclose the identity of a confidential source;
(iv) The document reflects only settlement negotiations between the Division of Enforcement and a person or entity who is not a respondent in the proceeding; or
(v) The hearing officer grants leave to withhold a document or category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
(2) Unless the hearing officer orders otherwise upon motion, the Division of Enforcement may redact information from a document if:
(i) The information is among the categories set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section; or
(ii) The information consists of the following with regard to a person other than the respondent to whom the information is being produced:
(A) An individual's social-security number;
(B) An individual's birth date;
(C) The name of an individual known to be a minor; or
(D) A financial account number, taxpayer-identification number, credit card or debit card number, passport number, driver's license number, or state-issued identification number other than the last four digits of the number.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph (b) authorizes the Division of Enforcement in connection with an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding to withhold, contrary to the doctrine of
Brady v. Maryland,
373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
(c)
Withheld document list.
The hearing officer may require the Division of Enforcement to submit for review a list of documents or categories of documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section or to submit any document withheld, and may determine whether any such document should be made available for inspection and copying. When similar documents are withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, those documents may be identified by category instead of by individual document. The hearing officer retains discretion to determine when an identification by category is insufficient.
(d)
Timing of inspection and copying.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall commence making documents available to a respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to this section no later than 7 days after service of the order instituting proceedings. In a proceeding in which a temporary cease-and-desist order is sought pursuant to § 201.510 or a temporary suspension of registration is sought pursuant to § 201.520, documents shall be made available no later
than the day after service of the decision as to whether to issue a temporary cease-and-desist order or temporary suspension order.
(e)
Place of inspection and copying.
Documents subject to inspection and copying pursuant to this section shall be made available to the respondent for inspection and copying at the Commission office where they are ordinarily maintained, or at such other place as the parties, in writing, may agree. A respondent shall not be given custody of the documents or leave to remove the documents from the Commission's offices pursuant to the requirements of this section other than by written agreement of the Division of Enforcement. Such agreement shall specify the documents subject to the agreement, the date they shall be returned and such other terms or conditions as are appropriate to provide for the safekeeping of the documents.
(f)
Copying costs and procedures.
The respondent may obtain a photocopy of any documents made available for inspection. The respondent shall be responsible for the cost of photocopying. Unless otherwise ordered, charges for copies made by the Division of Enforcement at the request of the respondent will be at the rate charged pursuant to the fee schedule identified on the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) web page of the Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov
for copies. The respondent shall be given access to the documents at the Commission's offices or such other place as the parties may agree during normal business hours for copying of documents at the respondent's expense.
(g)
Issuance of investigatory subpoenas after institution of proceedings.
The Division of Enforcement shall promptly inform the hearing officer and each party if investigatory subpoenas are issued under the same investigation file number or pursuant to the same order directing private investigation (“formal order”) under which the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings was conducted. The hearing officer shall order such steps as necessary and appropriate to assure that the issuance of investigatory subpoenas after the institution of proceedings is not for the purpose of obtaining evidence relevant to the proceedings and that any relevant documents that may be obtained through the use of investigatory subpoenas in a continuing investigation are made available to each respondent for inspection and copying on a timely basis.
(h)
Failure to make documents available—harmless error.
In the event that a document required to be made available to a respondent pursuant to this section is not made available by the Division of Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required, unless the respondent shall establish that the failure to make the document available was not harmless error.

§ 201.231
Enforcement and disciplinary proceedings: Production of witness statements.
(a)
Availability.
Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding may move that the Division of Enforcement produce for inspection and copying any statement of any person called or to be called as a witness by the Division of Enforcement that pertains, or is expected to pertain, to his or her direct testimony and that would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. For purposes of this section,
statement
shall have the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time and place fixed by the hearing officer and shall be made available to any party, provided, however, that the production shall be made under conditions intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.
(b)
Failure to produce—harmless error.
In the event that a statement required to be made available for inspection and copying by a respondent is not turned over by the Division of Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required unless the respondent establishes that the failure to turn over the statement was not harmless error.

§ 201.232
Subpoenas.
(a)
Availability; procedure.
In connection with any hearing ordered by the Commission or any deposition permitted under § 201.233, a party may request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses at such depositions or at the designated time and place of hearing, and subpoenas requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence returnable at any designated time or place. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant to § 201.150. A person whose request for a subpoena has been denied or modified may not request that any other person issue the subpoena.
(1)
Unavailability of hearing officer.
In the event that the hearing officer assigned to a proceeding is unavailable, the party seeking issuance of the subpoena may seek its issuance from the first available of the following persons: The Chief Administrative Law Judge, the law judge most senior in service as a law judge, the duty officer, any other member of the Commission, or any other person designated by the Commission to issue subpoenas. Requests for issuance of a subpoena made to the Commission, or any member thereof, must be submitted to the Secretary, not to an individual Commissioner.
(2)
Signing may be delegated.
A hearing officer may authorize issuance of a subpoena, and may delegate the manual signing of the subpoena to any other person authorized to issue subpoenas.
(b)
Standards for issuance.
Where it appears to the person asked to issue the subpoena that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the person requested to issue the subpoena determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the foregoing determination, the person issuing the subpoena may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be proved.
(c)
Service.
Service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of § 201.150(b) through (d). The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the issuance of subpoenas for purposes of investigations, as required by 17 CFR 203.8, as well as depositions and hearings.
(d)
Tender of fees required.
When a subpoena ordering the attendance of a person at a hearing or deposition is issued at the instance of anyone other than an officer or agency of the United States, service is valid only if the subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the subpoenaed person of the fees for one day's attendance and mileage specified by paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Application to quash or modify
—(1)
Procedure.
Any person to whom a subpoena or notice of deposition is directed, or who is an owner, creator or the subject of the documents that are to be produced pursuant to a subpoena, or any party may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 15 days after the date of service of such subpoena or notice, request that the subpoena or notice be quashed or modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with the Secretary and served on all parties pursuant to § 201.150. The party on whose behalf the subpoena or notice was issued may, within five days of service of the application, file an opposition to the application. If a hearing officer has been assigned to the proceeding, the application to quash shall be directed to that hearing officer for consideration, even if the subpoena or notice was issued by another person.
(2)
Standards governing application to quash or modify.
If compliance with the subpoena or notice of deposition would be unreasonable, oppressive, unduly burdensome or would unduly delay the hearing, the hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify the subpoena or notice, or may order a response to the subpoena, or appearance at a deposition, only upon specified
conditions. These conditions may include but are not limited to a requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall make reasonable compensation to the person to whom the subpoena was addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for return of the subpoena.
(3)
Additional standards governing application to quash deposition notices or subpoenas filed pursuant to § 201.233(a).
The hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify a deposition notice or subpoena filed or issued pursuant to § 201.233(a) unless the requesting party demonstrates that the deposition notice or subpoena satisfies the requirements of § 201.233(a), and:
(i) The proposed deponent was a witness of or participant in any event, transaction, occurrence, act, or omission that forms the basis for any claim asserted by the Division of Enforcement, any defense, or anything else required to be included in an answer pursuant to § 201.220(c) by any respondent in the proceeding (this excludes a proposed deponent whose only knowledge of these matters arises from the Division of Enforcement's investigation or the proceeding);
(ii) The proposed deponent is a designated as an “expert witness” under § 201.222(b); provided, however, that the deposition of an expert who is required to submit a written report under § 201.222(b) may only occur after such report is served; or
(iii) The proposed deponent has custody of documents or electronic data relevant to the claims or defenses of any party (this excludes Division of Enforcement or other Commission officers or personnel who have custody of documents or data that was produced by the Division to the respondent).
(f)
Witness fees and mileage.
Witnesses summoned before the Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear. Except for such witness fees and mileage, each party is responsible for paying any fees and expenses of the expert witnesses whom that party designates under § 201.222(b), for appearance at any deposition or hearing.
[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 13177, Mar. 19, 2004; 81 FR 50235, July 29, 2016]
§ 201.233
Depositions upon oral examination.
(a)
Depositions upon written notice.
In any proceeding under the 120-day timeframe designated pursuant to § 201.360(a)(2), depositions upon written notice may be taken as set forth in this paragraph. No other depositions shall be permitted except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) If the proceeding involves a single respondent, the respondent may file written notices to depose no more than three persons, and the Division of Enforcement may file written notices to depose no more than three persons.
(2) If the proceeding involves multiple respondents, the respondents collectively may file joint written notices to depose no more than five persons, and the Division of Enforcement may file written notices to depose no more than five persons. The depositions taken under this paragraph (a)(2) shall not exceed a total of five depositions for the Division of Enforcement, and five depositions for all respondents collectively.
(3)
Additional depositions upon motion.
Any side may file a motion with the hearing officer seeking leave to notice up to two additional depositions beyond those permitted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(i)
Procedure.
(A) A motion for additional depositions must be filed no later than 90 days prior to the hearing date. Any party opposing the motion may submit an opposition within five days after service of the motion. No reply shall be permitted. The motion and any oppositions each shall not exceed seven pages in length. These limitations exclusively govern motions under this section; notwithstanding § 201.154(a), any points and authorities shall be included in the motion or opposition, with no separate statement of points and authorities permitted, and
none of the requirements in § 201.154(b) or (c) shall apply.
(B) Upon consideration of the motion and any opposing papers, the hearing officer will issue an order either granting or denying the motion. The hearing officer shall consider the motion on an expedited basis.
(C) The proceeding shall not automatically be stayed pending the determination of the motion.
(ii)
Grounds and standards for motion.
A motion under this paragraph (a)(3) shall not be granted unless the additional depositions satisfy § 201.232(e) and the moving side demonstrates a compelling need for the additional depositions by:
(A) Identifying each of the witnesses whom the moving side plans to depose pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section as well as the additional witnesses whom the side seeks to depose;
(B) Describing the role of each witness and proposed additional witness;
(C) Describing the matters concerning which each witness and proposed additional witness is expected to be questioned, and why the deposition of each witness and proposed additional witness is necessary for the moving side's arguments, claims, or defenses; and
(D) Showing that the additional deposition(s) requested will not be unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.
(iii) If the moving side proposes to take and submit the additional deposition(s) on written questions, as provided in § 201.234, the motion shall so state. The motion for additional depositions shall constitute a motion under § 201.234(a), and the moving party is required to submit its questions with its motion under this rule. The procedures for such a deposition shall be governed by § 201.234.
(4) A deponent's attendance may be ordered by subpoena issued pursuant to the procedures in § 201.232; and
(5) The Commission or hearing officer may rule on a motion that a deposition noticed under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section shall not be taken upon a determination under § 201.232(e). The fact that a witness testified during an investigation does not preclude the deposition of that witness.
(b)
Depositions when witness is unavailable.
In addition to depositions permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission or the hearing officer may grant a party's request to file a written notice of deposition if the requesting party shows that the prospective witness will likely give testimony material to the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective witness, who is then within the United States, will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.
(c)
Service and contents of notice.
Notice of any deposition pursuant to this section shall be made in writing and served on each party pursuant to § 201.150. A notice of deposition shall designate by name a deposition officer. The deposition officer may be any person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. A notice of deposition also shall state:
(1) The name and address of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;
(2) The time and place of the deposition; provided that a subpoena for a deposition may command a person to attend a deposition only as follows:
(i) Within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person;
(ii) Within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if the person is a party or a party's officer;
(iii) At such other location that the parties and proposed deponent stipulate; or
(iv) At such other location that the hearing officer or the Commission determines is appropriate; and
(3) The manner of recording and preserving the deposition.
(d)
Producing documents.
In connection with any deposition pursuant to this section, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum under § 201.232. The party conducting
the deposition shall serve upon the deponent any subpoena duces tecum so issued. The materials designated for production, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice of deposition.
(e)
Method of recording
—(1)
Method stated in the notice.
The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the hearing officer or Commission orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition, at that party's expense. Each party shall bear its own costs for obtaining copies of any transcripts or audio or audiovisual recordings.
(2)
Additional method.
With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the hearing officer or the Commission orders otherwise.
(f)
By remote means.
The parties may stipulate—or the hearing officer or Commission may on motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this section, the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.
(g)
Deposition officer's duties

(2)
Conducting the deposition; avoiding distortion.
If the deposition is recorded non-stenographically, the deposition officer must repeat the items in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.
(3)
After the deposition.

The testimony must be recorded by the deposition officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the deposition officer. The witness being deposed may have counsel present during the deposition.
(2)
Form of objections stated during the deposition.
An objection at the time of the examination—whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the deposition officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination shall still proceed and the testimony shall be taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the hearing officer or the Commission, or to present a motion to the hearing officer or the Commission for a limitation on the questioning in the deposition.
(i)
Waiver of objections
—(1)
To the notice.
An objection to an error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served in writing on the party giving the notice.

(3)
To the taking of the deposition
—(i)
Objection to competence, relevance, or materiality.
An objection to a deponent's competence—or to the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony—is not waived by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.
(ii)
Objection to an error or irregularity.
An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:
(A) It relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a question or answer, the oath or affirmation, a party's conduct, or other matters that might have been corrected at that time; and
(B) It is not timely made during the deposition.
(4)
To completing and returning the deposition.
An objection to how the deposition officer transcribed the testimony—or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition—is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

In a deposition conducted by the Division, the respondents collectively shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time for cross-examination of the deponent. The hearing officer or the Commission may allow additional time if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.
(2)
Motion to terminate or limit
—(i)
Grounds.
At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to present the motion to the hearing officer or the Commission.
(ii)
Order.
Upon a motion under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the hearing officer or the Commission may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope. If terminated, the deposition may be resumed only by order of the hearing officer or the Commission.
(k)

—(1)
Review; statement of changes.
On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is completed, and unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer or the Commission, the deponent must be allowed 14 days after being notified by the deposition officer that the transcript or recording is available, unless a longer time is agreed to by the parties or permitted by the hearing officer, in which:
(i) To review the transcript or recording; and
(ii) If there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.

Documents and tangible things
—(i)
Originals and copies.
Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a party's request, be marked for identification and attached to the deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them wants to keep the originals, the person may:
(A) Offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposition, and then used as originals—after giving all parties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparing them with the originals; or
(B) Give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are marked—in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.
(ii)
Order regarding the originals.
Any party may move for an order that the originals be attached to the deposition pending final disposition of the case.
(3)

§ 201.235
Introducing prior sworn statements or declarations.
(a) At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn deposition taken pursuant to § 201.233 or § 201.234, investigative testimony, or other sworn statement or a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, of a witness, not a party, otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement or declaration is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may require that all relevant portions of the statement or declaration be introduced. If all of a statement or declaration is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to introduce a prior sworn statement or declaration may be granted if:
(1) The witness is dead;
(2) The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior sworn statement or declaration;
(3) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
(4) The party offering the prior sworn statement or declaration has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
(5) In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn statement or declaration to be used. In making this determination, due regard shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn statement or declaration in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.
(b)
Sworn statement or declaration of party or agent.
An adverse party may use for any purpose a deposition taken pursuant to § 201.233 or § 201.234, investigative testimony, or other sworn statement or a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, of a party or anyone who, when giving the sworn statement or declaration, was the party's officer, director, or managing agent.

§ 201.240
Settlement.
(a)
Availability.
Any person who is notified that a proceeding may or will be instituted against him or her, or any party to a proceeding already instituted, may, at any time, propose in writing an offer of settlement.
(b)
Procedure.
An offer of settlement shall state that it is made pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part of the offer the provisions of paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this section; shall be signed by the person making the offer, not by counsel; and shall be submitted to the interested division.
(c)
Consideration of offers of settlement.
(1) Offers of settlement shall be considered by the interested division when time, the nature of the proceedings, and the public interest permit.
(2) Where a hearing officer is assigned to a proceeding, the interested division and the party submitting the offer may request that the hearing officer express his or her views regarding the appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for the hearing officer to express his or her views on an offer of settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement conference constitutes a waiver by the persons making the request of any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the hearing officer based on the views expressed.
(3) The interested division shall present the offer of settlement to the Commission with its recommendation, except that, if the division's recommendation is unfavorable, the offer shall not be presented to the Commission unless the person making the offer so requests.
(4) By submitting an offer of settlement, the person making the offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
(i) All hearings pursuant to the statutory provisions under which the proceeding is to be or has been instituted;
(ii) The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(iii) Proceedings before, and an initial decision by, a hearing officer;
(iv) All post-hearing procedures; and
(v) Judicial review by any court.
(5) By submitting an offer of settlement the person further waives:
(i) Such provisions of the Rules of Practice or other requirements of law as may be construed to prevent any member of the Commission's staff from participating in the preparation of, or advising the Commission as to, any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
(ii) Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Commission based on the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or any part of the proceeding.
(6) If the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the person making the offer shall be notified of the Commission's action and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall not constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the person making the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to any discussions concerning the rejected offer of settlement.
(7) Final acceptance of any offer of settlement will occur only upon the issuance of findings and an order by the Commission.
§ 201.250
Dispositive motions.
(a)
Motion for a ruling on the pleadings.
No later than 14 days after a respondent's answer has been filed, any party may move for a ruling on the pleadings on one or more claims or defenses, asserting that, even accepting all of the non-movant's factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor, the movant is entitled to a ruling as a matter of law. The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion.
(b)
Motion for summary disposition in 30- and 75-day proceedings.
In any proceeding under the 30- or 75-day timeframe designated pursuant to § 201.360(a)(2), after a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to § 201.230, any party may make a motion for summary disposition on one or more claims or defenses, asserting that the undisputed pleaded facts, declarations, affidavits, documentary evidence or facts officially noted pursuant to § 201.323 show that there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary disposition as a matter of law. The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. If it appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present prior to the hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion.
(c)
Motion for summary disposition in 120-day proceedings.
In any proceeding under the 120-day timeframe designated pursuant to § 201.360(a)(2), after a respondent's answer has been filed and documents have been made available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to § 201.230, a party may make a motion for summary disposition on one or more claims or defenses, asserting that the undisputed pleaded facts, declarations, affidavits, deposition transcripts, documentary evidence or facts officially noted pursuant to § 201.323 show that there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary disposition as a matter of law. A motion for summary disposition shall be made only with leave of the hearing officer.

The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. If it appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present prior to the hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion.

Dispositive motions, together with any supporting memorandum of points and authorities (exclusive of any declarations, affidavits, deposition transcripts or other attachments), shall not exceed 9,800 words. Requests for leave to file motions and accompanying documents in excess of 9,800 words are disfavored. A double-spaced motion that does not, together with any accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, exceed 35 pages in length, inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference (but excluding any declarations, affidavits, deposition transcripts or attachments) in the dispositive motion, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 9,800 words. Any motion that exceeds this page limit must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the word limit set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words in the motion.

§ 201.301
Hearings to be public.
All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential treatment filed pursuant to § 201.190, hearings held to consider a motion for a protective order pursuant to § 201.322, and hearings on
ex parte
application for a temporary cease-and-desist order, shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its own motion or the motion of a party. No hearing shall be nonpublic where all respondents request that the hearing be made public.
§ 201.302
Record of hearings.
(a)
Recordation.
Unless ordered otherwise by the hearing officer or the Commission, all hearings shall be recorded and a written transcript thereof shall be prepared.
(b)
Availability of a transcript.
Transcripts of public hearings shall be available for purchase at prescribed rates. Transcripts of nonpublic proceedings, and transcripts subject to a protective order pursuant to § 201.322, shall be available for purchase only by parties; provided, however, that any person compelled to submit data or evidence in a hearing may purchase a copy of his or her own testimony.
(c)
Transcript correction.
Prior to the filing of post-hearing briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, or within such earlier time as directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, a party or witness may make a motion to correct the transcript. Proposed corrections of the transcript may be submitted to the hearing officer by stipulation pursuant to § 201.324, or by motion. Upon notice to all parties to the proceeding, the hearing officer may, by order, specify corrections to the transcript.
§ 201.310
Failure to appear at hearings: Default.
Any person named in an order instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed who fails to appear at a hearing of which he or she has been duly notified may be deemed to be in default pursuant to § 201.155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to § 201.155(b).
§ 201.320
Evidence: Admissibility.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Commission or the hearing officer may receive relevant evidence and shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or unreliable.
(b) Subject to § 201.235, evidence that constitutes hearsay may be admitted if it is relevant, material, and bears satisfactory indicia of reliability so that its use is fair.
[81 FR 50239, July 29, 2016]
§ 201.321
Evidence: Objections and offers of proof.
(a)
Objections.
Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence must be made on the record and shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the hearing officer need not be noted at the time of the ruling. Such exceptions will be deemed waived on appeal to the Commission, however, unless raised:
(1) Pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with § 201.400;
(2) In a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to § 201.340; or
(3) In a petition for Commission review of an initial decision filed in accordance with § 201.410.
(b)
Offers of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant to § 201.350(b).
§ 201.322
Evidence: Confidential information, protective orders.
(a)
Procedure.
In any proceeding as defined in § 201.101(a), a party, any person who is the owner, subject or creator of a document subject to subpoena or which may be introduced as evidence, or any witness who testifies at a hearing may file a motion requesting a protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties or to the public documents or testimony that contain confidential information. The motion should include a general summary or extract of the documents without revealing confidential details.
(b)
Submission of confidential information.
If review of the documents that are the subject of a request for a protective order is necessary to a ruling on the motion and the information as to which a protective order is sought is available to the movant, the motion shall be accompanied by:
(1) A complete, sealed copy of the materials containing the information as to which a protective order is sought, with the allegedly confidential information marked as such, and with the first page of the document labeled “Under Seal.” If the movant seeks a protective order against disclosure to other parties as well as the public, copies of the documents shall not be served on other parties; and
(2) A redacted copy of the materials containing the information as to which a protective order is sought, with the allegedly confidential information redacted. The redacted version shall indicate any omissions with brackets or ellipses, and its pagination and depiction of text on each page shall be identical to that of the sealed version. A redacted copy need not accompany a motion requesting a protective order if the materials would be redacted in their entirety.
(c)
Basis for issuance.
Documents and testimony introduced in a public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the benefits of disclosure.
(d)
Requests for additional information supporting confidentiality.
A movant under paragraph (a) of this section may be required to furnish in writing additional information with respect to the grounds for confidentiality. Failure to supply the information so requested within five days from the date of receipt by the movant of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the objection to public disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the additional information relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such five-day period.
(e)
Confidentiality of documents pending decision.
Pending a determination of a motion under this section, the documents as to which confidential treatment is sought and any other documents that would reveal the confidential information in those documents shall be maintained under seal and shall be disclosed only in accordance with orders of the Commission or the hearing officer. Any order issued in connection with a motion under this section shall be public unless the order would disclose information as to which a protective order has been granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the protected information shall be nonpublic.

Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be judicially noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter in the public official records of the Commission, or any matter which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. If official notice is requested or taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the parties, upon timely request, shall
be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.
§ 201.324
Evidence: Stipulations.
The parties may, by stipulation, at any stage of the proceeding agree upon any pertinent facts in the proceeding. A stipulation may be received in evidence and, when received, shall be binding on the parties to the stipulation.

A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation.

(1)

A person who reasonably cannot submit exhibits electronically must file a certification under § 201.351(c)(1) that explains why the person reasonably cannot comply. The filing also must indicate the expected duration of the person's reasonable inability to comply, such as whether the certification is intended to apply to a solitary submission or all submissions made during the proceeding.

§ 201.360
Initial decision of hearing officer and timing of hearing.
(a)(1)
When required.

(2)
Time period for filing initial decision and for hearing
—(i)
Initial decision.
In the order instituting proceedings, the Commission will specify a time period in which the hearing officer's initial decision must be filed with the Secretary. In the Commission's discretion, after consideration of the nature, complexity, and urgency of the subject matter, and with due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, this time period will be either 30, 75, or 120 days. The time period will run from the occurrence of the following events:
(A) The completion of post-hearing briefing in a proceeding where the hearing has been completed; or
(B) The completion of briefing on a § 201.250 motion in the event the hearing officer has determined that no hearing is necessary; or
(C) The determination by the hearing officer that, pursuant to § 201.155, a party is deemed to be in default and no hearing is necessary.
(ii)
Hearing.
Under the 120-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order scheduling the hearing to begin approximately four months (but no more than ten months) from the date of service of the order instituting the proceeding. Under the 75-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order scheduling the hearing to begin approximately 2
1/2
months (but no more than six months) from the date of service of the order instituting the proceeding. Under the 30-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order scheduling the hearing to begin approximately one month (but no more than four months) from the date of service of the order instituting the proceeding. These deadlines confer no substantive rights on respondents. If a stay is granted pursuant to § 201.161(c)(2)(i) or § 201.210(c)(3), the time period specified in the order instituting proceedings in which the hearing officer's initial decision must be filed with the Secretary, as well as any other time limits established in orders issued by the hearing officer in the proceeding, shall be automatically tolled during the period while the stay is in effect.
(3)
Certification of extension; motion for extension.
(i) In the event that the hearing officer presiding over the proceeding determines that it will not be possible to file the initial decision within the specified period of time, the hearing officer may certify to the Commission in writing the need to extend the initial decision deadline by up to 30 days for case management purposes. The certification must be issued no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the time specified for the issuance of an initial decision and be served on the Commission and all parties in the proceeding. If the Commission has not issued an order to the contrary within 14 days after receiving the certification, the extension set forth in the hearing officer's certification shall take effect.
(ii) Either in addition to a certification of extension, or instead of a certification of extension, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may submit a motion to the Commission requesting an extension of the time period for filing the initial decision. First, the hearing officer presiding over the proceeding must consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge. Following such consultation, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may determine, in his or her discretion, to submit a motion to the Commission requesting an extension of the time period for filing the initial decision. This motion may request an extension of any length but must be filed no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of the time specified in the certification of extension, or if there is no certification of extension, 30 days prior to the expiration of the time specified in the order instituting proceedings. The motion will be served upon all parties in the proceeding, who may file with the Commission statements in support of or in opposition to the motion. If the Commission determines that additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall issue an order extending the time period for filing the initial decision.
(iii) The provisions of this paragraph (a)(3) confer no rights on respondents.
(b)
Content.
An initial decision shall include findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, as to all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record and the appropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof. The initial decision shall also state the time period, not to exceed 21 days after service of the decision, except for good cause shown, within which a petition for review of the initial decision may be filed. The reasons for any extension of time shall be stated in the initial decision. The initial decision shall also include a statement that, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section:
(1) The Commission will enter an order of finality as to each party unless a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review of the initial decision or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision; and
(2) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or if the Commission takes action to review as to a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
(c)
Filing, service and publication.
The Secretary shall promptly serve the initial decision upon the parties and shall promptly publish notice of the filing thereof on the SEC website; provided, however, that in nonpublic proceedings no notice shall be published unless the Commission otherwise directs.
(d)
Finality.
(1) If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision, or if the Commission on its own initiative orders review of a decision with respect to a party or a person aggrieved who would be entitled to review, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
(2) If a party or aggrieved person entitled to review fails to file timely a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial decision, and if the Commission does not order review of a decision on its own initiative, the Commission will issue an order that the decision has become final as to that party. The decision becomes final upon issuance of the order. The order of finality shall state the date on which sanctions, if any, take effect. Notice of the order shall be published on the SEC website.

(b)
Procedure.
The petition for review of an initial decision shall be filed with the Commission within such time after service of the initial decision as prescribed by the hearing officer pursuant to § 201.360(b) unless a party has filed a motion to correct an initial decision with the hearing officer. If such correction has been sought, a party shall have 21 days from the date of the hearing officer's order resolving the motion to correct to file a petition for review. The petition shall set forth a statement of the issues presented for review under § 201.411(b). In the event a petition for review is filed, any other party to the proceeding may file a cross-petition for review within the original time allowed for seeking review or within ten days from the date that the petition for review was filed, whichever is later.
(c)
Length limitation.
Except with leave of the Commission, the petition for review shall not exceed three pages in length. Incorporation of pleadings or filings by reference into the petition is not permitted. Motions to file petitions in excess of those limitations are disfavored.
(d)

Any person who files a petition for review of an initial decision that asserts that person's inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty shall file with the opening brief a sworn financial disclosure statement containing the information specified in § 201.630(b).
(e)
Prerequisite to judicial review.
Pursuant to Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission for review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a final order entered pursuant to such decision.

§ 201.411
Commission consideration of initial decisions by hearing officers.
(a)
Scope of review.
The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial decision by a hearing officer and may make any findings or conclusions that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.
(b)
Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for review
—(1)
Mandatory review.
After a petition for review has been filed, the Commission shall review any initial decision that:
(i) Denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or Section 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78
l
(d);
(ii) Suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or
(iii) Is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in 5 U.S.C. 554(a) (1) through (6)).
(2)
Discretionary review.
The Commission may decline to review any other decision. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission shall consider whether the petition for review makes a reasonable showing that:
(i) A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the proceeding; or
(ii) The decision embodies:
(A) A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly erroneous; or
(B) A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
(C) An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important and that the Commission should review.
(c)
Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review.
The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any initial decision, or any portion of any initial decision, within 21 days after the end of the period established for filing a petition for review pursuant to § 201.410(b). A party who does not intend to file a petition for review, and who desires the Commission's determination whether to order review on its own initiative to be made in a shorter time, may make a motion for an expedited decision, accompanied by a written statement that the party waives its right to file a petition for review. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to the Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for review.
(d)
Limitations on matters reviewed.
Review by the Commission of an initial decision shall be limited to the issues specified in an opening brief that complies with § 201.450(b), or the issues, if any, specified in the briefing schedule order issued pursuant to § 201.450(a). Any exception to an initial decision not supported in an opening brief that complies with § 201.450(b) may, at the discretion of the Commission, be deemed to have been waived by the petitioner. On notice to all parties, however, the Commission may, at any time prior to issuance of its decision, raise and determine any other matters that it deems material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the parties.
(e)
Summary affirmance.
(1) At any time within 21 days after the filing of a petition for review pursuant to § 201.410(b), any party may file a motion in accordance with § 201.154 asking that the Commission summarily affirm an initial decision. Any party may file an opposition and reply to such motion in accordance with § 201.154. Pending determination of the motion for summary affirmance, the Commission, in its discretion, may delay issuance of a briefing schedule order pursuant to § 201.450.
(2) Upon consideration of the motion and any opposition or upon its own initiative, the Commission may summarily affirm an initial decision. The Commission may grant summary affirmance if it finds that no issue raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the Commission of further oral or written argument. The Commission will decline to grant summary affirmance upon a reasonable showing that a prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the proceeding or that the decision embodies an exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important and that the Commission should review.
(f)
Failure to obtain a majority.
In the event a majority of participating Commissioners do not agree to a disposition on the merits, the initial decision shall be of no effect, and an order will be issued in accordance with this result.
[60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 13179, Mar. 19, 2004; 70 FR 72570, Dec. 5, 2005; 81 FR 50240, July 29, 2016]

The Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters properly before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral argument unless the Commission determines that the presentation of facts and legal arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process would be significantly aided by oral argument.
(b)
Procedure.
Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate motion accompanying the initial brief on the merits. The Commission shall issue an order as to whether oral argument is to be heard, and if so, the time and place therefor. If oral argument is granted, the time fixed for oral argument shall be changed only by written order of the Commission, for good cause shown. The order shall state at whose request the change is made and the reasons for any such changes. No visual aids may be used at oral argument unless copies have been provided to the Commission and all parties at least five business days before the argument is to be held.
(c)
Time allowed.
Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more than one half-hour per side will be allowed for oral argument. The Commission may, in its discretion, determine that several persons have a common interest, and that the interests represented will be considered a single side for purposes of allotting time for oral argument. Time will be divided equally among persons on a single side, provided, however, that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their time among themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for argument.
(d)
Participation of Commissioners.
A member of the Commission who was not present at the oral argument may participate in the decision of the proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed the transcript of such argument prior to such participation. The decision shall state whether the required review was made.

Prior to a ruling on the motion, no party receiving information as to which a motion for a protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other person without the prior permission of the Commission or the hearing officer.
(d)
Service required.
Notwithstanding any provision of § 201.322, a copy of the financial disclosure statement shall be served on the Division of Enforcement.
(e)
Failure to file required financial information: sanction.
Any respondent who, after making a claim of inability to pay either disgorgement, interest or a penalty, fails to file a financial disclosure statement when such a filing has been ordered or is required by rule may, in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, be deemed to have waived the claim of inability to pay. No sanction pursuant to §§ 201.155 or 201.180 shall be imposed for a failure to file such a statement.
§ 201.700
Initiation of proceedings for SRO proposed rule changes and for proposed NMS plans and plan amendments.
(a)
Rules of Practice.
For purposes of these Rules of Practice contained at 17 CFR 201.700 through 201.701, the following Rules of Practice apply:
(1) Rule 103, 17 CFR 201.103 (Construction of Rules);
(2) Rule 104, 17 CFR 201.104 (Business Hours); and
(3) Rule 160, 17 CFR 201.160 (Time Computation).
(b)
Institution of proceedings; notice and opportunity to submit written views
—(1)
Generally.
If the Commission determines to initiate proceedings to determine whether a self-regulatory organization's proposed rule change or whether a proposed national market system (“NMS”) plan or a proposed amendment to an effective NMS plan (proposed NMS plan or NMS plan amendment hereinafter collectively referred to as “NMS plan filing”) should be disapproved, it shall provide notice thereof to the self-regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule change or to the NMS plan participants, as well as all interested parties and the public, by publication in the
Federal Register
of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.
(i)
Prior to notice.
If the Commission determines to institute proceedings prior to initial publication by the Commission of the notice of the self-regulatory organization's proposed rule change or the notice of the NMS plan filing in the
Federal Register,
then the Commission shall publish notice of the proposed rule change or the NMS plan filing simultaneously with a brief summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.
(ii)
Subsequent to notice.
If the Commission determines to institute proceedings subsequent to initial publication by the Commission of the notice of the self-regulatory organization's proposed rule change or the notice of the NMS plan filing in the
Federal Register,
then the Commission shall publish separately in the
Federal Register
a brief summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.
(iii)
Service of an order instituting proceedings.
In addition to publication in the
Federal Register
of the grounds for disapproval under consideration, the Secretary, or another duly authorized officer of the Commission, shall serve a copy of the grounds for disapproval under consideration to the self-regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule change by serving notice to the person listed as the contact person on the cover page of the Form 19b-4 filing and shall serve a copy of the grounds for disapproval under consideration to the NMS plan participants by serving notice to the contact person for the NMS plan. Notice shall be made by delivering a copy of the order to such contact person either by any method specified in § 201.141(a) or by electronic means including email.
(2)
Notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.
The grounds for disapproval under consideration shall include a brief statement of the matters of fact and law on which the Commission instituted the proceedings, including the areas in which the Commission may have questions or may need to solicit additional information on the proposed rule change or NMS plan filing. The Commission may consider during the course of the proceedings additional matters of fact and law beyond what was set forth in its notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.
(3)
Demonstration of consistency with the Exchange Act.
(i) The burden to demonstrate that a proposed rule change is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to the self-regulatory organization is on the self-regulatory organization that proposed the rule change. As reflected in the General Instructions to Form 19b-4, the Form is designed to elicit information necessary for the public to provide meaningful comment on the proposed rule change and for the Commission to determine whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory organization. The self-regulatory organization must provide all information elicited by the Form, including the exhibits, and must present the information in a clear and comprehensible
manner. In particular, the self-regulatory organization must explain why the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory organization. A mere assertion that the proposed rule change is consistent with those requirements, or that another self-regulatory organization has a similar rule in place, is not sufficient. Instead, the description of the proposed rule change, its purpose and operation, its effect, and a legal analysis of its consistency with applicable requirements must all be sufficiently detailed and specific to support an affirmative Commission finding. Any failure of the self-regulatory organization to provide the information elicited by Form 19b-4 may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a proposed rule change is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to the self-regulatory organization.
(ii) The burden to demonstrate that a NMS plan filing is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to NMS plans is on the plan participants that filed the NMS plan filing. In particular, these plan participants must explain why the NMS plan filing is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to NMS plans. A mere assertion that the NMS plan filing is consistent with those requirements is not sufficient. Instead, the description of the NMS plan filing, its purpose and operation, its effect, and a legal analysis of its consistency with applicable requirements must all be sufficiently detailed and specific to support an affirmative Commission finding. Any failure of the plan participants that filed the NMS plan filing to provide such detail and specificity may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a NMS plan filing is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to NMS plans.
(c)
Conduct of hearings
—(1)
Initial comment period in writing.
Unless otherwise specified by the Commission in its notice of grounds for disapproval under consideration, all interested persons will be given an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the proposed rule change or NMS plan filing under consideration and whether the Commission should approve or disapprove the proposed rule change or NMS plan filing.
(i) The self-regulatory organization that submitted the proposed rule change may file a written statement in support of its proposed rule change demonstrating, in specific detail, how such proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory organization, including a response to each of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. Such statement may include specific representations or undertakings by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission will specify in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration the length of the initial comment period.
(ii) The NMS plan participants may file a written statement in support of a NMS plan filing demonstrating, in specific detail, how such NMS plan filing is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to NMS plans, including a response to each of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. Such statement may include specific representations or undertakings by the plan participants. The Commission will specify in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration the length of the initial comment period.
(2)
Oral.
The Commission, in its sole discretion, may determine whether any issues relevant to approval or disapproval would be facilitated by the opportunity for an oral presentation of views.
(3)
Rebuttal.
(i) At the end of the initial comment period, the self-regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule change will be given an opportunity to respond to any comments
received. The self-regulatory organization may voluntarily file, or the Commission may request a self-regulatory organization to file, a response to a comment received regarding any aspect of the proposed rule change under consideration to assist the Commission in determining whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. The Commission will specify in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration the length of the rebuttal period.
(ii) At the end of the initial comment period, the NMS plan participants will be given an opportunity to respond to any comments received. The plan participants may voluntarily file, or the Commission may request the plan participants to file, a response to a comment received regarding any aspect of such NMS plan filing under consideration to assist the Commission in determining whether such NMS plan filing should be disapproved. The Commission will specify in the summary of the grounds for disapproval under consideration the length of the rebuttal period.
(4)
Non-response.
(i) Any failure by the self-regulatory organization to provide a complete response, within the applicable time period specified, to a comment letter received or to the Commission's grounds for disapproval under consideration may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a proposed rule change is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to the self-regulatory organization.
(ii) Any failure by the NMS plan participants to provide a complete response, within the applicable time period specified, to a comment letter received or to the Commission's grounds for disapproval under consideration may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a NMS plan filing is consistent with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are applicable to NMS plans.
(d)
Record before the Commission
—(1)
Filing of papers with the Commission.
Filing of papers with the Commission shall be made by filing them with the Secretary, including through electronic means. In its notice setting forth the grounds for disapproval under consideration for a proposed rule change or a NMS plan filing, the Commission shall inform interested parties of the methods by which they may submit written comments and arguments for or against Commission approval.
(2)
Public availability of materials received.
During the conduct of the proceedings, the Commission generally will make available publicly all written comments it receives without change. In its notice setting forth the grounds for disapproval under consideration for a proposed rule change or a NMS plan filing, the Commission shall inform interested parties of the methods by which they may view all written communications relating to the proposed rule change or a NMS plan filing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552.
(3)
Record before the Commission.
The Commission shall determine each matter on the basis of the record.
(i) The record shall consist of the proposed rule change filed on Form 19b-4 by the self-regulatory organization, including all attachments and exhibits thereto, and all written materials received from any interested parties on the proposed rule change, including the self-regulatory organization that filed the proposed rule change, through the means identified by the Commission as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, as well as any written materials that reflect communications between the Commission and any interested parties.
(ii) The record shall consist of the NMS plan filing filed by the plan participants, including all attachments and exhibits thereto, and all written materials received from any interested parties on such NMS plan filing, including the plan participants, through the means identified by the Commission as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, as well as any written materials that reflect communications between the Commission and any interested parties.
(e)
Amended notice not required.
The Commission is not required to amend its notice of grounds for disapproval under consideration in order to consider, during the course of the proceedings, additional matters of fact and law beyond what was set forth in the notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration.

# Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning Adjudicatory Proceedings
§ 201.900
Informal procedures and supplementary information concerning adjudicatory proceedings.
(a)
Guidelines for the timely completion of proceedings.
(1) Timely resolution of adjudicatory proceedings is one factor in assessing the effectiveness of the adjudicatory program in protecting investors, promoting public confidence in the securities markets and assuring respondents a fair hearing. Establishment of guidelines for the timely completion of key phases of contested administrative proceedings provides a standard for both the Commission and the public to gauge the Commission's adjudicatory program on this criterion. The Commission has directed that:
(i) To the extent possible, a decision by the Commission on review of an interlocutory matter should be completed within 45 days of the date set for filing the final brief on the matter submitted for review.
(ii) To the extent possible, a decision by the Commission on a motion to stay a decision that has already taken effect or that will take effect within five days of the filing of the motion, should be issued within five days of the date set for filing of the opposition to the motion for a stay. If the decision complained of has not taken effect, the Commission's decision should be issued within 45 days of the date set for filing of the opposition to the motion for a stay.
(iii) Ordinarily, a decision by the Commission with respect to an appeal from the initial decision of a hearing officer, a review of a determination by a self-regulatory organization or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or a remand of a prior Commission decision by a court of appeals will be issued within eight months from the completion of briefing on the petition for review, application for review, or remand order. If the Commission determines that the complexity of the issues presented in a petition for review, application for review, or remand order warrants additional time, the decision of the Commission in that matter may be issued within ten months of the completion of briefing.
(iv) If the Commission determines that a decision by the Commission cannot be issued within the period specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the Commission may extend that period by orders as it deems appropriate in its discretion. The guidelines in this paragraph (a) confer no rights or entitlements on parties or other persons.
(2) The guidelines in this paragraph (a) do not create a requirement that each portion of a proceeding or the entire proceeding be completed within the periods described. Among other reasons, Commission review may require additional time because a matter is unusually complex or because the record is exceptionally long. In addition, fairness is enhanced if the Commission's deliberative process is not constrained by an inflexible schedule. In some proceedings, deliberation may be delayed by the need to consider more urgent matters, to permit the
preparation of dissenting opinions, or for other good cause. The guidelines will be used by the Commission as one of several criteria in monitoring and evaluating its adjudicatory program. The guidelines will be examined periodically, and, if necessary, readjusted in light of changes in the pending caseload and the available level of staff resources.
(b)
Reports to the Commission on pending cases.
The administrative law judges, the Secretary and the General Counsel have each been delegated authority to issue certain orders or adjudicate certain proceedings.
See
17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-18. Proceedings are also assigned to the General Counsel for the preparation of a proposed order or opinion which will then be recommended to the Commission for consideration. In order to improve accountability by and to the Commission for management of the docket, the Commission has directed that confidential status reports with respect to all filed adjudicatory proceedings shall be made periodically to the Commission. These reports will be made through the Secretary, with a minimum frequency established by the Commission. In connection with these periodic reports, if a proceeding pending before the Commission has not been concluded within 30 days of the guidelines established in paragraph (a) of this section, the General Counsel shall specifically apprise the Commission of that fact, and shall describe the procedural posture of the case, project an estimated date for conclusion of the proceeding, and provide such other information as is necessary to enable the Commission to make a determination under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section or to determine whether additional steps are necessary to reach a fair and timely resolution of the matter.
(c)
Publication of information concerning the pending case docket.
Ongoing disclosure of information about the adjudication program caseload increases awareness of the importance of the program, facilitates oversight of the program and promotes confidence in the efficiency and fairness of the program by investors, securities industry participants, self-regulatory organizations and other members of the public. The Commission has directed the Secretary to publish in the first and seventh months of each fiscal year summary statistical information about the status of pending adjudicatory proceedings and changes in the Commission's caseload over the prior six months. The report will include the number of cases pending before the administrative law judges and the Commission at the beginning and end of the six-month period. The report will also show increases in the caseload arising from new cases being instituted, appealed or remanded to the Commission and decreases in the caseload arising from the disposition of proceedings by issuance of initial decisions, issuance of final decisions issued on appeal of initial decisions, other dispositions of appeals of initial decisions, final decisions on review of self-regulatory organization determinations, other dispositions on review of self-regulatory organization determinations, and decisions with respect to stays or interlocutory motions. For each category of decision, the report shall also show the median age of the cases at the time of the decision, the number of cases decided within the guidelines for the timely completion of adjudicatory proceedings, and, with respect to appeals from initial decisions, reviews of determinations by self-regulatory organizations or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and remands of prior Commission decisions, the median days from the completion of briefing to the time of the Commission's decision.

# Subpart E—Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties

# Authority:
28 U.S.C. 2461 note.

# Source:
81 FR 43045, July 1, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
§ 201.1001
Adjustment of civil monetary penalties.
(a) For violations from December 10, 1996, through November 2, 2015: As required by the Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the Commission has adjusted the maximum
amounts of all civil monetary penalties it administers under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for inflation in the releases and prior regulations listed in the footnotes to Table I. The penalty amounts provided in Table I apply to violations of these statutes that occurred from December 10, 1996, through November 2, 2015, with each column listing the penalty amounts for violations that occurred in a particular time frame. To determine the penalty amounts for violations that occurred prior to December 10, 1996, please refer to the applicable statutory text. To determine penalty amounts for violations after November 2, 2015, please refer to paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) For violations after November 2, 2015: The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that civil monetary penalties be adjusted on an annual basis for inflation. Pursuant to this requirement, the maximum amounts of all civil monetary penalties under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will be adjusted annually for inflation. Notice of these adjusted penalty amounts will be published by the Commission in the
Federal Register
on or before January 15 of each calendar year and will be available, along with the Commission's prior inflation adjustments, on the Commission's Web site at
https://www.sec.gov/enforce/civil-penalties-inflation-adjustments.htm.
The adjusted penalty amounts will apply to all penalties imposed after the effective date of the adjustment (for the first day the adjustment is effective, the prior year's penalty amounts shall apply), for violations that occurred after November 2, 2015. The adjusted penalty amount each year will be the larger of:
(1) The maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year; or
(2) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.

# Subpart F—Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans

# Authority:
15 U.S.C. 77h-1, 77s, 77u, 78c(b), 78d-1, 78d-2, 78u-2, 78u-3, 78v, 78w, 80a-9, 80a-37, 80a-39, 80a-40, 80b-3, 80b-11, 80b-12, and 7246.

# Source:
69 FR 13180, Mar. 19, 2004, unless otherwise noted.
§ 201.1100
Creation of Fair Fund.
In any agency process initiated by an order instituting proceedings in which the Commission or the hearing officer issues an order requiring the payment of disgorgement by a respondent and also assessing a civil money penalty against that respondent, the Commission or the hearing officer may order that the amount of disgorgement and of the civil penalty, together with any funds received pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), be used to create a fund for the benefit of investors who were harmed by the violation.
[70 FR 72570, Dec. 5, 2005]
§ 201.1101
Submission of plan of distribution; contents of plan.
(a)
Submission.
The Commission or the hearing officer may, at any time, order any party to submit a plan for the administration and distribution of funds in a Fair Fund or disgorgement fund. Unless ordered otherwise, the Division of Enforcement shall submit a proposed plan no later than 60 days after the respondent has turned over the funds or other assets pursuant to the Commission's order imposing disgorgement and, if applicable, a civil money penalty and any appeals of the Commission's order have been waived or completed, or appeal is no longer available.
(b)
Contents of plan.
Unless otherwise ordered, a plan for the administration of a Fair Fund or a disgorgement fund shall include the following elements:
(1) Procedures for the receipt of additional funds, including the specification of any account where funds will be held, the instruments in which the funds may be invested; and, in the case of a Fair Fund, the receipt of any funds pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), if applicable;
(2) Specification of categories of persons potentially eligible to receive proceeds from the fund;
(3) Procedures for providing notice to such persons of the existence of the fund and their potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the fund;
(4) Procedures for making and approving claims, procedures for handling disputed claims, and a cut-off date for the making of claims;
(5) A proposed date for the termination of the fund, including provision for the disposition of any funds not otherwise distributed;
(6) Procedures for the administration of the fund, including selection, compensation, and, as necessary, indemnification of a fund administrator to oversee the fund, process claims, prepare accountings, file tax returns, and, subject to the approval of the Commission, make distributions from the fund to investors who were harmed by the violation; and
(7) Such other provisions as the Commission or the hearing officer may require.
§ 201.1102
Provisions for payment.
(a)
Payment to registry of the court or court-appointed receiver.
Subject to such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer shall deem appropriate, a plan for the administration of a Fair Fund or a disgorgement fund may provide for payment of funds into a court registry or to a court-appointed receiver in any case pending in federal or state court against a respondent or any other person based upon a complaint alleging violations arising from the same or substantially similar facts as those alleged in the Commission's order instituting proceedings.
(b)
Payment to the United States Treasury under certain circumstances.
When, in the opinion of the Commission or the hearing officer, the cost of administering a plan of disgorgement relative to the value of the available disgorgement funds and the number of potential claimants would not justify distribution of the disgorgement funds to injured investors, the plan may provide that the disgorgement funds and any civil penalty shall be paid directly to the general fund of the United States Treasury.
§ 201.1103
Notice of proposed plan and opportunity for comment by non-parties.
Notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or a proposed Fair Fund plan shall be published on the SEC website and in such other publications as the Commission or the hearing officer may require. The notice shall specify how copies of the proposed plan may be obtained and shall state that persons desiring to comment on the proposed plan may submit their views, in writing, to the Commission.
[83 FR 25366, June 1, 2018]
§ 201.1104
Order approving, modifying, or disapproving proposed plan.
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or of a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission, a proposed plan that is substantially modified prior to adoption may be republished for an additional comment period pursuant to § 201.1103. The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered within 30 days after the end of the final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless the Commission or the hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause shown.
§ 201.1105
Administration of plan.
(a)
Appointment and removal of administrator.
The Commission or the hearing officer shall have discretion to appoint any person, including a Commission employee, as administrator of a plan of disgorgement or a Fair Fund plan and to delegate to that person responsibility for administering the plan. An administrator may be removed at any time by order of the Commission or hearing officer.
(b)
Assistance by respondent.
A respondent may be required or permitted to administer or assist in administering a plan of disgorgement subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate to ensure the proper distribution of the funds.
(c)
Administrator to post bond.
If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the administrator shall be required to obtain a bond in the manner prescribed in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be approved by the Commission. The cost of the bond may be paid for as a cost of administration. The Commission may waive posting of a bond for good cause shown.
(d)
Administrator's fees.
If the administrator is a Commission employee, no fee shall be paid to the administrator for his or her services. If the administrator is not a Commission employee, the administrator may file an application for fees for completed services, and upon approval by the Commission or a hearing officer, may be paid a reasonable fee for those services. Any objections thereto shall be filed within 21 days of service of the application on the parties.
(e)
Source of funds.
Unless otherwise ordered, fees and other expenses of administering the plan shall be paid first from the interest earned on the funds, and if the interest is not sufficient, then from the corpus.
(f)
Accountings.
During the first 10 days of each calendar quarter, or as otherwise directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, the administrator shall file an accounting of all monies earned or received and all monies spent in connection with the administration of the plan of disgorgement. A final accounting shall be submitted for approval of the Commission or hearing officer prior to discharge of the administrator and cancellation of the administrator's bond, if any.
(g)
Amendment.
A plan may be amended upon motion by any party or by the plan administrator or upon the Commission's or the hearing officer's own motion.
§ 201.1106
Right to challenge.
Other than in connection with the opportunity to submit comments as provided in § 201.1103, no person shall be granted leave to intervene or to participate or otherwise to appear in any agency proceeding or otherwise to challenge an order of disgorgement or creation of a Fair Fund; or an order approving, approving with modifications, or disapproving a plan of disgorgement
or a Fair Fund plan; or any determination relating to a plan based solely upon that person's eligibility or potential eligibility to participate in a fund or based upon any private right of action such person may have against any person who is also a respondent in the proceeding.

§ 202.1
General.
(a) The statutes administered by the Commission provide generally (1) for the filing with it of certain statements, such as registration statements, periodic and ownership reports, and proxy solicitation material, and for the filing of certain plans of reorganization, applications and declarations seeking Commission approvals; (2) for Commission determination through formal procedures of matters initiated by private parties or by the Commission; (3) for the investigation and examination of persons and records where necessary to carry out the purposes of the statutes and for enforcement of statutory provisions; and (4) for the adoption of rules and regulations where necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statutes.
(b) In addition to the Commission's rules of practice set forth in part 201 of this chapter, the Commission has promulgated rules and regulations pursuant to the several statutes it administers (parts 230, 240, 260, 270 and 275 of this chapter). These parts contain substantive provisions and include as well numerous provisions detailing the procedure for meeting specific standards embodied in the statutes. The Commission's rules and regulations under each of the statutes are available in pamphlet form upon request to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
(c) The statutes and the published rules, regulations and forms thereunder prescribe the course and method of formal procedures to be followed in Commission proceedings. These are supplemented where feasible by certain informal procedures designed to aid the public and facilitate the execution of the Commission's functions. There follows a brief description of procedures generally followed by the Commission which have not been formalized in rules.
(d) The informal procedures of the Commission are largely concerned with the rendering of advice and assistance by the Commission's staff to members of the public dealing with the Commission. While opinions expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official expression of the Commission's views, they represent the views of persons who are continuously working
with the provisions of the statute involved. And any statement by the director, associate director, assistant director, chief accountant, chief counsel, or chief financial analyst of a division can be relied upon as representing the views of that division. In certain instances an informal statement of the views of the Commission may be obtained. The staff, upon request or on its own motion, will generally present questions to the Commission which involve matters of substantial importance and where the issues are novel or highly complex, although the granting of a request for an informal statement by the Commission is entirely within its discretion.
[25 FR 6736, July 15, 1960, as amended at 76 FR 71875, Nov. 21, 2011]
§ 202.2
Pre-filing assistance and interpretative advice.
The staff of the Commission renders interpretative and advisory assistance to members of the general public, prospective registrants, applicants and declarants. For example, persons having a question regarding the availability of an exemption may secure informal administrative interpretations of the applicable statute or rule as they relate to the particular facts and circumstances presented. Similarly, persons contemplating filings with the Commission may receive advice of a general nature as to the preparation thereof, including information as to the forms to be used and the scope of the items contained in the forms. Inquiries may be directed to an appropriate officer of the Commission's staff. In addition, informal discussions with members of the staff may be arranged whenever feasible, at the Commission's central office or, except in connection with certain matters under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at one of its regional offices.
[25 FR 6736, July 15, 1960, as amended at 59 FR 5945, Feb. 9, 1994; 73 FR 32227, June 5, 2008; 76 FR 71875, Nov. 21, 2011]
§ 202.3
Processing of filings.
(a) Registration statements, proxy statements, letters of notification, periodic reports, applications for qualification of indentures, and similar documents filed with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and certain filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are routed to the Division of Corporation Finance, which passes initially on the adequacy of disclosure and recommends the initial action to be taken. If the filing appears to afford inadequate disclosure, as for example through omission of material information or through violation of accepted accounting principles and practices, the usual practice is to bring the deficiency to the attention of the person who filed the document by letter from the Assistant Director assigned supervision over the particular filing, and to afford a reasonable opportunity to discuss the matter and make the necessary corrections. This informal procedure is not generally employed when the deficiencies appear to stem from careless disregard of the statutes and rules or a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead or where the Commission deems formal proceedings necessary in the public interest. If an electronic filing is not prepared in accordance with the requirements of the current EDGAR Filer Manual, the filing may be suspended and the filer so notified. Reasonable opportunity will be afforded the filer to make the necessary corrections or resubmit the filing as needed. Where it appears that the filing affords adequate disclosure, acceleration of its effectiveness when appropriate normally will be granted. A similar procedure is followed with respect to filings under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and certain filings relating to investment companies under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, which are routed to the Division of Investment Management. A similar procedure is also followed in the Commission's Regional Offices with respect to registration statements on Forms SB-1 and SB-2 (17 CFR 239.9 and 239.10) and related filings under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
(b)(1) Applications for registration as brokers, dealers, investment advisers, municipal securities dealers and transfer agents are submitted to the Office of Filings and Information Services where they are examined to determine
whether all necessary information has been supplied and whether all required financial statements and other documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned with a request for correction or held until corrected before being accepted as a filing. The files of the Commission and other sources of information are considered to determine whether any person connected with the applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 45 days of the date of the filing of a broker-dealer, investment adviser or municipal securities dealer application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall by order grant registration or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. An application for registration as a transfer agent shall become effective within 30 days after receipt of the application (or within such shorter period as the Commission may determine). The Office of Filings and Information Services is also responsible for the processing and substantive examination of statements of beneficial ownership of securities and changes in such ownership filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and for the examination of reports filed pursuant to § 230.144 of this chapter.
(2) Applications for registration as national securities exchanges, or exemption from registration as exchanges by reason of such exchanges' limited volume of transactions filed with the Commission are routed to the Division of Trading and Markets, which examines these applications to determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and whether all required financial statements and other documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned. The files of the Commission and other sources of information are considered to determine whether any person connected with the applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 90 days of the date of publication of a notice of the filing of an application for registration as a national securities exchange, or exemption from registration by reason of such exchanges' limited volume of transactions (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall by order grant registration, or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied as provided in § 240.19(a)(1) of this chapter.
(3) Notice forms for registration as national securities exchanges pursuant to section 6(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f(g)(1)) filed with the Commission are routed to the Division of Trading and Markets, which examines these notices to determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and whether all other required documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective notices may be returned.

§ 202.3a
Instructions for filing fees.
(a)
General instructions for remittance of filing fees.
Payment of filing fees specified by the following sections shall be made according to the directions listed in this section: §§ 230.111, 240.0-9, and 270.0-8 of this chapter. All such fees are to be paid through the U.S. Treasury designated lockbox depository or system and may be paid by wire transfer, debit card, or credit card or via the Automated Clearing House
Network (“ACH”) pursuant to the specific instructions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Checks will not be accepted for payment of fees. To ensure proper posting, all filers must include their Commission-assigned Central Index Key (CIK) number (also known as the Commission-assigned registrant or payor account number) on fee payments. If a third party submits a fee payment, the fee payment must specify the account number to which the fee is to be applied.
(b)
Instructions for payment of filing fees.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, these instructions provide direction for remitting fees specified in paragraph (a) of this section. You may contact the Filing Fees Branch in the Office of Financial Management at (202) 551-8900 or go to
https://www.sec.gov/paymentoptions
for additional information if you have questions.
(1)
Instructions for payment of fees by wire transfer (FEDWIRE).
U.S. Bank, N.A. in St. Louis, Missouri, is the U.S. Treasury designated financial agent for Commission filing fee payments. The hours of operation at U.S. Bank for wire transfers are each day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays, 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, whichever is currently in effect. Any bank or wire transfer service may initiate wire transfers of filing fee payments through the FEDWIRE system to U.S. Bank. A filing entity does not need to establish an account at U.S. Bank in order to remit filing fee payments.
(i) To ensure proper credit and prompt filing acceptance, in all wire transfers of filing fees to the Commission, you must include:
(A) The Commission's account number at U.S. Bank (850000001001); and
(B) The payor's CIK number.
(ii) You may refer to the examples found on the Commission's website at
https://www.sec.gov/paymentoptions
for the proper format.
(2)
Instructions for payment of fees by debit card or credit card or via the Automated Clearing House Network (ACH).
To remit a filing fee payment by debit card or credit card or via ACH, please go to the Commission's EDGAR system.

# Note 1 to paragraph (b):
Wire transfers and debit card, credit card, and ACH payments are not instantaneous. The time required to process a wire transfer through the FEDWIRE system, from origination to receipt by U.S. Bank, varies substantially. Debit card and credit card payments generally are expected to become available to the Commission the next day. ACH payments generally are expected to become available to the Commission within one to three business days. Specified filings, such as registration statements pursuant to section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 that provide for the registration of securities and mandate the receipt of the appropriate fee payment upon filing, and transactional filings pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as many proxy statements involving extraordinary business transactions, will not be accepted if sufficient funds have not been received by the Commission at the time of filing.

# Note 2 to paragraph (b):
You should obtain the reference number of the wire transfer from your bank or wire transfer service. Having this number can greatly facilitate tracing the funds if any problems occur. If a wire transfer of filing fees does not contain the required information in the proper format, the Commission may not be able to identify the payor and the acceptance of filings may be delayed. To ensure proper credit, you must provide all required information to the sending bank or wire transfer service. Commission data must be inserted in the proper fields. The most critical data are the Commission's account number at U.S. Bank and the payor CIK, the Commission-assigned account number identified as the CIK number.
(c)
Special instructions for §§ 230.462(b) and 230.110(d) of this chapter.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, for registration statements filed pursuant to §§ 230.462(b) and § 230.110(d) of this chapter, payment of filing fees for the purposes of this section may be made by:
(1) The registrant or its agent instructing its bank or a wire transfer service to transmit to the Commission the applicable filing fee by a wire transfer of such amount from the issuer's account or its agent's account to the U.S. Treasury designated lockbox depository as soon as practicable, but no later than the close of the next business day following the filing of the registration statement; and
(2) The registrant submitting with the registration statement at the time of filing a certification that:
(i) The registrant or its agent has so instructed its bank or a wire transfer service;
(ii) The registrant or its agent will not revoke such instructions; and
(iii) The registrant or its agent has sufficient funds in such account to cover the amount of such filing fee.

# Note to paragraph (
c

# ):
Such instructions may be sent on the date of filing the registration statement after the close of business of such bank or wire transfer service, provided that the registrant undertakes in the certification sent to the Commission with the registration statement that it will confirm receipt of such instructions by the bank or wire transfer service during regular business hours on the following business day.
(d)
Filing fee accounts.
A filing fee account is maintained for each filer who submits a filing requiring a fee on the Commission's EDGAR system or who submits funds to the U.S. Treasury designated depository in anticipation of paying a filing fee. Account statements are regularly prepared and provided to account holders. Account holders must maintain a current account address with the Commission to ensure timely access to these statements.

# Note to paragraph (
d

# ):
The deposit of money into a filing fee account does not constitute payment of a filing fee. Payment of the filing fee occurs at the time the filing is made, commensurate with the drawing down of the balance of the fee account.
(e)
Return of funds from inactive accounts.
Funds held in any filing fee account in which there has not been a deposit, withdrawal or other adjustment for more than three years will be returned to the account holder, and account statements will not be sent again until a deposit, withdrawal or other adjustment is made with respect to the account. Filers must maintain a current account address to assure the timely return of funds. It may not be possible to return funds from inactive accounts if the Commission is unable to identify a current account address of an account holder after making reasonable efforts to do so.

# Note to paragraph (
e

# ):
A company must update its account and other addresses using the EDGAR Web site. This method ensures data integrity and the timeliest update.

§ 202.4
Facilitating administrative hearings.
(a) Applications, declarations, and other requests involving formal Commission action after opportunity for hearing are scrutinized by the appropriate division for conformance with applicable statutory standards and Commission rules and generally the filing party is advised of deficiencies. Prior to passing upon applications and declarations the Commission receives the views of all interested persons at public hearings whenever appropriate; hence, any applicant or declarant seeking Commission approval of proposed transactions by a particular time should file his application or declaration in time to allow for the presentation and consideration of such views.
(b) After the staff has had an opportunity to study an application or declaration, interested persons may informally discuss the problems therein raised to the extent that time and the nature of the case permit (e.g., consideration is usually given to whether the proceeding is contested and if so to the nature of the contest). In such event, the staff will, to the extent feasible, advise as to the nature of the issues raised by the filing, the necessity for any amendments to the documents filed, the type of evidence it believes should be presented at the hearing and, in some instances, the nature, form, and contents of documents to be submitted as formal exhibits. The staff will, in addition, generally advise as to Commission policy in past cases which dealt with the same subject matter as the filing under consideration.
(c) During the course of the hearings, the staff is generally available for informal discussions to reconcile bona fide divergent views not only between itself and other persons interested in the proceedings, but among all interested persons; and, when circumstances permit, an attempt is made to narrow, if possible, the issues to be considered at the formal hearing.
(d) In some instances the Commission in the order accompanying its findings and opinion reserves jurisdiction over certain matters relating to the proceeding, such as payment of fees and expenses, accounting entries, terms and conditions relating to securities to be issued, and other matters. In such cases, upon receipt of satisfactory information and data the Commission considers whether further hearing is required before releasing jurisdiction.
§ 202.5
Enforcement activities.
(a) Where, from complaints received from members of the public, communications from Federal or State agencies, examination of filings made with the Commission, or otherwise, it appears that there may be violation of the acts administered by the Commission or the rules or regulations thereunder, a preliminary investigation is generally made. In such preliminary investigation no process is issued or testimony compelled. The Commission may, in its discretion, make such formal investigations and authorize the use of process as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules of a self-regulatory organization of which the person is a member or participant. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the investigation or examination is non-public and the reports thereon are for staff and Commission use only.
(b) After investigation or otherwise the Commission may in its discretion take one or more of the following actions: Institution of administrative proceedings looking to the imposition of remedial sanctions, initiation of injunctive proceedings in the courts, and, in the case of a willful violation, reference of the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, on some occasions, refer the matter to, or grant requests for access to its files made by, domestic and foreign governmental authorities or foreign securities authorities, self-regulatory organizations such as stock exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and other persons or entities.
(c) Persons who become involved in preliminary or formal investigations may, on their own initiative, submit a written statement to the Commission setting forth their interests and position in regard to the subject matter of the investigation. Upon request, the staff, in its discretion, may advise such persons of the general nature of the investigation, including the indicated violations as they pertain to them, and the amount of time that may be available for preparing and submitting a statement prior to the presentation of a staff recommendation to the Commission for the commencement of an administrative or injunction proceeding. Submissions by interested persons should be forwarded to the appropriate Division Director or Regional Director with a copy to the staff members conducting the investigation and should be clearly referenced to the specific investigation to which they relate. In the event a recommendation for the commencement of an enforcement proceeding is presented by the staff, any submissions by interested persons will be forwarded to the Commission in conjunction with the staff memorandum.
(d) In instances where the staff has concluded its investigation of a particular matter and has determined that it will not recommend the commencement of an enforcement proceeding against a person, the staff, in its discretion, may advise the party that its formal investigation has been terminated. Such advice if given must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff's investigation of the particular matter.
(e) The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur. Accordingly, it hereby announces its policy not to permit a defendant or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the complaint
or order for proceedings. In this regard, the Commission believes that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.
(f) In the course of the Commission's investigations, civil lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, the staff, with appropriate authorization, may discuss with persons involved the disposition of such matters by consent, by settlement, or in some other manner. It is the policy of the Commission, however, that the disposition of any such matter may not, expressly or impliedly, extend to any criminal charges that have been, or may be, brought against any such person or any recommendation with respect thereto. Accordingly, any person involved in an enforcement matter before the Commission who consents, or agrees to consent, to any judgment or order does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims against him in that investigative, civil, or administrative matter and not for the purpose of resolving any criminal charges that have been, or might be, brought against him. This policy reflects the fact that neither the Commission nor its staff has the authority or responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and representatives of the Department of Justice.

§ 202.6
Adoption, revision, and rescission of rules and regulations of general application.
(a) The procedure followed by the Commission in connection with the adoption, revision, and rescission of rules of general application necessarily varies in accordance with the nature of the rule, the extent of public interest therein, and the necessity for speed in its adoption. Rules relating to Commission organization, procedure and management, for example, are generally adopted by the Commission without affording public discussion thereof. On the other hand, in the adoption of substantive rules materially affecting an industry or a segment of the public, such as accounting rules, every feasible effort is made in advance of adoption to receive the views of persons to be affected. In such cases, proposals for the adoption, revision, or rescission of rules are initiated either by the Commission or by members of the public, and to the extent practicable, the practices set forth in paragraph (b) of this section are observed.
(b) After preliminary consideration by the Commission a draft of the proposed rule is published in the
Federal Register
and mailed to interested persons (e.g., other interested regulatory bodies, principal registrants or persons to be affected, stock exchanges, professional societies and leading authorities on the subject concerned and other persons requesting such draft) for comments. Unless accorded confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, written comments filed with the Commission on or before the closing date for comments become a part of the public record upon the proposed rule. The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the public record written comments received by the Commission after the closing date.
(c) Following analysis of comments received, the rule may be adopted in the form published or in a revised form in the light of such comments. In some cases, a revised draft is prepared and published and, where appropriate, an oral hearing may be held before final action upon the proposal. Any interested person may appear at the hearing and/or may submit written comment for consideration in accordance with the Commission's notice of the rulemaking procedure to be followed. The rule in the form in which it is adopted by the Commission is publicly released and is published in the
Federal Register.

§ 202.9
Small entity enforcement penalty reduction policy.
The Commission's policy with respect to whether to reduce or assess civil money penalties against a small entity is:
(a) The Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis whether to reduce or not assess civil money penalties against a small entity. In determining whether to reduce or not assess penalties against a specific small entity, the following considerations will apply:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, penalty reduction will not be available for any small entity if:
(i) The small entity was subject previously to an enforcement action;
(ii) Any of the small entity's violations involved willful or criminal conduct; or
(iii) The small entity did not make a good faith effort to comply with the law.
(2) In considering whether the Commission will reduce or refrain from assessing a civil money penalty, the Commission may consider:
(i) The egregiousness of the violations;
(ii) The isolated or repeated nature of the violations;
(iii) The violator's state of mind when committing the violations;
(iv) The violator's history (if any) of legal or regulatory violations;
(v) The extent to which the violator cooperated during the investigation;
(vi) Whether the violator has engaged in subsequent remedial efforts to mitigate the effects of the violation and to prevent future violations;
(vii) The degree to which a penalty will deter the violator or others from committing future violations; and
(viii) Any other relevant fact.
(3) The Commission also may consider whether to reduce or not assess a civil money penalty against a small entity, including a small entity otherwise excluded from this policy under paragraphs (a)(1) (i)-(iii) of this section, if the small entity can demonstrate to the Commission's satisfaction that it is financially unable to pay the penalty, immediately or over a reasonable period of time, in whole or in part.
(4) For purposes of this policy, an entity qualifies as “small” if it is a small business or small organization as defined by Commission rules adopted for the purpose of compliance with the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.
1
An entity not included in these definitions will be considered “small” for purposes of this policy if it meets the total asset amount that applies to issuers as set forth in § 230.157a of this chapter.
2
1
Pursuant to the Reg. Flex. Act, 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the Commission has adopted appropriate definitions of “small business” for purposes of the Reg. Flex. Act.
See
17 CFR 270.0-10, 275.0-7, 240.0-10, 230.157, and 260.0-7. The Commission recently proposed amendments to certain of these definitions.
Definitions of “Small Business” or “Small Organization” Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Securities Act of 1933,
Securities Act Rel. No. 7383, 62 FR 4106 (Jan. 28, 1997). The Commission extended the comment period for the proposed amendments to April 30, 1997, 62 FR 13356 (Mar. 20, 1997). Based on an analysis of the language and legislative history of the Reg. Flex. Act, Congress does not appear to have intended that Act to apply to natural persons (as opposed to individual proprietorships) or to foreign entities. The Commission understands that staff at the Small Business Administration have taken the same position.
2
At present, this threshold is $5 million. Thus, non-regulated entities, such as general partnerships, privately held corporations or professional service organizations, with assets of $5 million or less may qualify for penalty-reduction.
(b) This policy does not create a right or remedy for any person. This policy shall not apply to any remedy that may be sought by the Commission other than civil money penalties, whether or not such other remedy may be characterized as penal or remedial.

§ 202.10
Policy statement of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning subpoenas to members of the news media.
Freedom of the press is of vital importance to the mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective journalism complements the Commission's efforts to ensure that investors receive the full and fair disclosure that the law requires, and that they deserve. Diligent reporting is an essential means of bringing securities law violations to light and ultimately helps to deter illegal conduct. In this
Policy Statement the Commission sets forth guidelines for the agency's professional staff
to ensure that vigorous enforcement of the federal securities laws is conducted completely consistently with the principles of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press, and specifically to avoid the issuance of subpoenas to members of the media that might impair the news gathering and reporting functions. These guidelines shall be adhered to by all members of the staff in all cases:
(a) In determining whether to issue a subpoena to a member of the news media, the approach in every case must be to strike the proper balance between the public's interest in the free dissemination of ideas and information and the public's interest in effective enforcement of the federal securities laws.
(b) When the staff investigating a matter determines that a member of the news media may have information relevant to the investigation, the staff should:
(1) Determine whether the information might be obtainable from alternative non-media sources.
(2) Make all reasonable efforts to obtain that information from those alternative sources. Whether all reasonable efforts have been made will depend on the particular circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
(3) Determine whether the information is essential to successful completion of the investigation.
(c) If the information cannot reasonably be obtained from alternative sources and the information is essential to the investigation, then the staff, after seeking approval from the responsible Regional Director, District Administrator, or Associate Director, should contact legal counsel for the member of the news media. Staff should contact a member of the news media directly only if the member is not represented by legal counsel. The purpose of this contact is to explore whether the member may have information essential to the investigation, and to determine the interests of the media with respect to the information.
If the nature of the investigation permits, the staff should make clear what its needs are as well as its willingness to respond to particular problems of the media. The staff should consult with the Commission's Office of Public Affairs, as appropriate.
(d) The staff should negotiate with news media members or their counsel, consistently with this Policy Statement, to obtain the essential information through informal channels, avoiding the issuance of a subpoena, if the responsible Regional Director, District Administrator, or Associate Director determines that such negotiations would not substantially impair the integrity of the investigation. Depending on the circumstances of the investigation, informal channels may include voluntary production, informal interviews, or written summaries.
(e) If negotiations are not successful in achieving a resolution that accommodates the Commission's interest in the information and the media's interests without issuing a subpoena, the staff investigating the matter should then consider whether to seek the issuance of a subpoena for the information. The following principles should guide the determination of whether a subpoena to a member of the news media should be issued:
(1) There should be reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is essential to successful completion of the investigation. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral or nonessential information.
(2) The staff should have exhausted all reasonable alternative means of obtaining the information from non-media sources. Whether all reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the information from alternative sources will depend on the particular circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.
(f) If there are reasonable grounds to believe the information sought is essential to the investigation, all reasonable alternative means of obtaining it have been exhausted, and all efforts at negotiation have failed, then the staff investigating the matter shall seek authorization for the subpoena from the Director of the Division of Enforcement. No subpoena shall be issued unless the Director, in consultation with the General Counsel, has authorized its issuance.
(g) In the event the Director of the Division of Enforcement, after consultation with the General Counsel, authorizes the issuance of a subpoena, notice shall immediately be provided to the Chairman of the Commission.
(h) Counsel (or the member of the news media, if not represented by counsel) shall be given reasonable and timely notice of the determination of the Director of the Division of Enforcement to authorize the subpoena and the Director's intention to issue it.
(i) Subpoenas should be negotiated with counsel for the member of the news media to narrowly tailor the request for only essential information. In negotiations with counsel, the staff should attempt to accommodate the interests of the Commission in the information with the interests of the media.
(j) Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of their demand for documents.
(k) In the absence of special circumstances, subpoenas to members of the news media should be limited to the verification of published information and to surrounding circumstances relating to the accuracy of published information.
(l) Because the intent of this policy statement is to protect freedom of the press, news gathering functions, and news media sources, this policy statement does not apply to demands for purely commercial or financial information unrelated to the news gathering function.
(m) Failure to follow this policy may constitute grounds for appropriate disciplinary action. The principles set forth in this statement are not intended to create or recognize any legally enforceable rights in any person.
[71 FR 20340, Apr. 20, 2006]
§ 202.12
Policy statement concerning cooperation by individuals in its investigations and related enforcement actions.
Cooperation by individuals and entities in the Commission's investigations and related enforcement actions can contribute significantly to the success of the agency's mission. Cooperation can enhance the Commission's ability to detect violations of the federal securities laws, increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's investigations, and provide important evidence for the Commission's enforcement actions. There is a wide spectrum of tools available to the Commission and its staff for facilitating and rewarding cooperation by individuals, ranging from taking no enforcement action to pursuing reduced charges and sanctions in connection with enforcement actions. As with any cooperation program, there exists some tension between the objectives of holding individuals fully accountable for their misconduct and providing incentives for individuals to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. This policy statement sets forth the analytical framework employed by the Commission and its staff for resolving this tension in a manner that ensures that potential cooperation arrangements maximize the Commission's law enforcement interests. Although the evaluation of cooperation requires a case-by-case analysis of the specific circumstances presented, as described in greater detail below, the Commission's general approach is to determine whether, how much, and in what manner to credit cooperation by individuals by evaluating four considerations: the assistance provided by the cooperating individual in the Commission's investigation or related enforcement actions (“Investigation”); the importance of the underlying matter in which the individual cooperated; the societal interest in ensuring that the cooperating individual is held accountable for his or her misconduct; and the appropriateness of cooperation credit based upon the profile of the cooperating individual. In the end, the goal of the Commission's analysis is to protect the investing public by determining whether the public interest in facilitating and rewarding an individual's cooperation in order to advance the Commission's law enforcement interests justifies the credit awarded to the individual for his or her cooperation.
(a)
Assistance provided by the individual.
The Commission assesses the assistance provided by the cooperating individual in the Investigation by considering, among other things:
(1) The value of the individual's cooperation to the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i) Whether the individual's cooperation resulted in substantial assistance to the Investigation;
(ii) The timeliness of the individual's cooperation, including whether the individual was first to report the misconduct to the Commission or to offer his or her cooperation in the Investigation, and whether the cooperation was provided before he or she had any knowledge of a pending investigation or related action;
(iii) Whether the Investigation was initiated based on information or other cooperation provided by the individual;
(iv) The quality of cooperation provided by the individual, including whether the cooperation was truthful, complete, and reliable; and
(v) The time and resources conserved as a result of the individual's cooperation in the Investigation.
(2) The nature of the individual's cooperation in the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i) Whether the individual's cooperation was voluntary or required by the terms of an agreement with another law enforcement or regulatory organization;
(ii) The types of assistance the individual provided to the Commission;
(iii) Whether the individual provided non-privileged information, which information was not requested by the staff or otherwise might not have been discovered;
(iv) Whether the individual encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff who might not have otherwise participated in the Investigation; and
(v) Any unique circumstances in which the individual provided the cooperation.
(b)
Importance of the underlying matter.
The Commission assesses the importance of the Investigation in which the individual cooperated by considering, among other things:
(1) The character of the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i) Whether the subject matter of the Investigation is a Commission priority;
(ii) The type of securities violations;
(iii) The age and duration of the misconduct;
(iv) The number of violations; and
(v) The isolated or repetitive nature of the violations.
(2) The dangers to investors or others presented by the underlying violations involved in the Investigation including, but not limited to:
(i) The amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations;
(ii) The type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations; and
(iii) The number of individuals or entities harmed.
1
1
Cooperation in Investigations that involve priority matters or serious, ongoing, or widespread violations will be viewed most favorably.
(c)
Interest in holding the individual accountable.
The Commission assesses the societal interest in holding the cooperating individual fully accountable for his or her misconduct by considering, among other things:
(1) The severity of the individual's misconduct assessed by the nature of the violations and in the context of the individual's knowledge, education, training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;
(2) The culpability of the individual, including, but not limited to, whether the individual acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the misconduct;
(3) The degree to which the individual tolerated illegal activity including, but not limited to, whether he or she took steps to prevent the violations from occurring or continuing, such as notifying the Commission or other appropriate law enforcement agency of the misconduct or, in the case of a violation involving a business organization, by notifying members of management not involved in the misconduct, the board of directors or the equivalent body not involved in the misconduct, or the auditors of such business organization of the misconduct;
(4) The efforts undertaken by the individual to remediate the harm caused by the violations including, but not limited to, whether he or she paid or agreed to pay disgorgement to injured investors and other victims or assisted these victims and the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and
(5) The sanctions imposed on the individual by other federal or state authorities and industry organizations for the violations involved in the Investigation.
(d)
Profile of the individual.
The Commission assesses whether, how much, and in what manner it is in the public interest to award credit for cooperation, in part, based upon the cooperating individual's personal and professional profile by considering, among other things:
(1) The individual's history of lawfulness, including complying with securities laws or regulations;
(2) The degree to which the individual has demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility for his or her past misconduct; and
(3) The degree to which the individual will have an opportunity to commit future violations of the federal securities laws in light of his or her occupation—including, but not limited to, whether he or she serves as: A licensed individual, such as an attorney or accountant; an associated person of a regulated entity, such as a broker or dealer; a fiduciary for other individuals or entities regarding financial matters; an officer or director of public companies; or a member of senior management—together with any existing or proposed safeguards based upon the individual's particular circumstances.

# Note to § 202.12:
Before the Commission evaluates an individual's cooperation, it analyzes the unique facts and circumstances of the case. The above principles are not listed in order of importance nor are they intended
to be all-inclusive or to require a specific determination in any particular case. Furthermore, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case, some of the principles may not be applicable or may deserve greater weight than others. Finally, neither this statement, nor the principles set forth herein creates or recognizes any legally enforceable rights for any person.

§ 202.13
Informal procedure with respect to applications under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
(a) On any application subject to 17 CFR 270.0-5, other than an application eligible for and proceeding under expedited review as provided for by 17 CFR 270.0-5(d), (e), and (f), the Division should take action within 90 days of the initial filing and each of the first three amendments thereto, and within 60 days of any subsequent amendment. Such 90- or 60-day period will stop running upon any irregular closure of the Commission's Washington, DC office to the public for normal business, including, but not limited to, closure due to a lapse in Federal appropriations, national emergency, inclement weather, or ad hoc Federal holiday, and will resume upon the reopening of the Commission's Washington, DC office to the public for normal business. The Division may grant 60-day extensions and the applicant should be notified of any such extension.
(b) Action on the application or any amendment thereto shall consist of:
(1) Issuing a notice;
(2) Providing the applicant with requests for clarification or modification of the application; or
(3) Informing applicant that the application will be forwarded to the Commission, in which case the application is no longer subject to the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The provisions of this section, including the timeframes provided for in this section, are not intended to create enforceable rights by any interested parties and shall not be deemed to do so. Rather, this section provides informal non-binding guidelines and procedures that the Commission anticipates the Division following.

(c)
Procedures for requesting interim Commission review.
(1) A request for interim Commission review with respect to matters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to the Commission's Office of the Secretary within 30 calendar days of the following:

(5) A timely review request by a firm will operate as a stay of publication of those portions of the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm subject to a determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, that are the subject of the firm's review request, unless the Commission otherwise determines in its own discretion. Upon expiration of the 30-day period during which the firm may request interim Commission review, the PCAOB shall make publicly available the remainder of the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm that were indentified in an inspection report, as applicable, that are not the subject of the firm's review request, unless the Commission otherwise determines that such a result would not be necessary or appropriate.
(6) If the firm fails to make a timely review request, pursuant to Section 104(g)(2) of the Act, the PCAOB shall make publicly available the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm that were indentified in an inspection report, as applicable.
(d)
Procedures for granting or denying the review request.
Within 30 calendar days of a timely review request, the Commission will notify the firm and the PCAOB as to whether the Commission will exercise its discretion to grant the request for an interim review. If the Commission does not grant the review request, the stay of publication is terminated upon notification to the firm and the PCAOB. If the Commission does grant the review request, the stay of publication shall continue unless the Commission determines otherwise in its own discretion, or unless the firm consents in writing to the PCAOB, with a copy to the Commission, to earlier publication.
(e)
Procedures where a review request has been granted.
(1) Where the Commission has notified the firm and the PCAOB that it is granting the request for an interim review, the PCAOB may submit responsive information and documents with the Commission within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice. The PCAOB must provide a copy of such information and documents simultaneously to the firm.
(2) During the course of the interim review, the Commission may request additional information relating to the PCAOB's assessments or determination under review, and provide a period of up to seven calendar days to respond to such request, from the PCAOB, the firm, and any associated person of the firm. The Commission may grant the firm or the PCAOB a period of up to seven calendar days to respond to any
information obtained pursuant to this paragraph. The firm or the PCAOB, as applicable, shall provide simultaneously to the other party all information provided as a result of a request for additional information or responses thereto. The firm with which any associated person from whom information is requested shall provide simultaneously to the PCAOB all information provided as a result of a request for additional information or responses thereto. If the firm (including any associated person) or the PCAOB fails to respond timely to a request from the Commission, such failure may serve as the basis for the Commission to conclude its review and make a determination adverse to the non-responsive party.
(3) The Commission, based on the information submitted by the firm, the PCAOB and any associated persons, shall consider whether the PCAOB's assessments or determination are arbitrary and capricious, or otherwise not consistent with the purposes of the Act.
(4) At the conclusion of its review, the Commission shall inform the firm and the PCAOB in writing that the Commission:
(i) Does not object to all or part of the assessments or determination of the PCAOB and the stay of publication is terminated; or
(ii) Remands to the PCAOB with instructions that the stay of publication is permanent or that the PCAOB take such other actions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate with respect to publication, including, but not limited to, revising the final inspection report or determinations before publication.
(5) The review pursuant to this section shall be completed and a written notice pursuant to this section shall be sent no more than 75 calendar days after notification to the firm and the PCAOB that the Commission is granting the request for an interim review, unless the Commission extends the period for good cause.
(f)
Treatment of review.
(1) Time periods in this section shall be computed as provided in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.160.
(2) Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, the decision to grant or deny a review request and the conclusions of the Commission's review shall be non-public, and the information or documents submitted, created, or obtained by the Commission or its staff in the course of the review shall be deemed non-public. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to impair or limit the ability of any party to request confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act, 15 U.S.C. 7215(b)(5), or any other applicable law.
(3) Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7214(h)(2), any decision of the Commission as a result of an interim review with respect to a PCAOB inspection report, including whether a request for review is granted or denied, shall not be reviewable under 15 U.S.C. 78y and shall not be deemed to be “final agency action” for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.
(4) Any action taken by the Commission relates solely to the publication of the relevant inspection report and does not affect the ability of the Commission or PCAOB to take appropriate action.
(g)
Designation of address; Representation.
(1) When a registered public accounting firm first submits a request for interim Commission review, or an associated person first submits information related to a request, the firm or associated person shall submit to the Commission, and keep current, an address at which any notice or other written communication furnished to the firm or associated person may be sent, a contact name and telephone number where the firm or associated person may be reached during business hours and, if represented, the representative's name, business address, and telephone number.
(2) If the firm, PCAOB, or associated person will be represented by a representative, the initial submission of that person shall be accompanied by the notice of appearance required by § 201.102(d). The other provisions of § 201.102 with respect to representation before the Commission shall apply.

§ 202.150
Commission approval of appointment or removal from office of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board hearing officers.
The Commission shall approve both the appointment and removal from office of any hearing officer employed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. No action by the Board proposing to appoint or remove from office a hearing officer shall be final absent Commission approval.
[84 FR 12908, Apr. 3, 2019]
§ 202.170
Initiation of disapproval proceedings for PCAOB proposed rules.
Initiation of disapproval proceedings for proposed rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as defined by section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are subject to the provisions of §§ 201.700 and 201.701 of this chapter as fully as if it were a
registered securities association,
except that:
(a)
Demonstration of consistency with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
For purposes of proposed rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, apply this paragraph in lieu of paragraph (b)(3) of § 201.700 of this chapter. The burden to demonstrate that a proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, or as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, is on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In its filing the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board must explain in a clear and comprehensible manner why the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations thereunder, or as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. A mere assertion that the proposed rule change is consistent with those requirements is not sufficient. Instead, the description of the proposed rule, its purpose and operation, its effect, and a legal analysis of its consistency with applicable requirements must all be sufficiently detailed and specific to support an affirmative Commission finding. Any failure by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in its proposed rule filing with the Commission may result in the Commission not having a sufficient basis to make an affirmative finding that a proposed rule change is consistent with the title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, or as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(b) For each reference to “the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the self-regulatory organization” apply “title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder applicable to such organization, or as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”

(3) In the event that the Commission has not approved a budget for a PCAOB fiscal year before the beginning of that fiscal year, the PCAOB may spend funds from the reserve and continue to incur obligations as if the PCAOB budget or supplemental budget most recently approved by the Commission were continuing in effect for that fiscal year.
(f)
Supplemental budget.
(1) The PCAOB may submit to the Commission a request for approval of a supplemental budget subsequent to Commission approval of the budget for the budget year in order to spend any amounts in excess of, or contrary to, the limitations described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

(1) Following submission of the PCAOB-approved budget to the Commission, such budget and budget justification, subject to any applicable exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, shall be made available to the public. Neither the Commission nor the PCAOB shall publish a preliminary budget, budget, budget justification, or any underlying materials in connection therewith, until such time as the budget is approved by the PCAOB and submitted to the Commission for its approval.
(2) Supplemental budgets shall be made public, following approval by the PCAOB and submission to the Commission, in the same manner as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

§ 204.1
Applicability and scope.
(a) The procedures authorized for administrative offset are contained in Section 10 of the Debt Collection Act (codified at 31 U.S.C. 3716). The Act requires that notice procedures be observed by the agency. The debtor is also afforded an opportunity to inspect and copy government records pertaining to the claim, enter into an agreement for repayment, and to a review of the claim (if requested). Like salary offset, agencies may cooperate with one another in order to effectuate recovery of the claim.
(b) The provisions of this subpart apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission). These regulations are consistent with the Debt Collection Act and the Federal Claims Collection Standards on administrative offset issued jointly by
the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury (31 CFR 901.3).

§ 204.3
General.
(a) The Chairperson (or designee) may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(b) The Chairperson (or designee) may notify the Department of the Treasury of delinquent debts for purposes of administrative offset, and may request another agency which holds funds payable to a Commission debtor to offset that debt against the funds held; the Commission will provide certification that:
(1) The debt is past due and legally enforceable; and
(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(c) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering the debt. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to judgment.
(d) Administrative offset under this subpart may not be initiated against:
(1) A debt in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute;
(2) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local Government; or
(3) Debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; the Social Security Act; or the tariff laws of the United States.
(e) The procedures for administrative offset in this subpart do not apply to the offset of Federal salaries under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or Federal tax refunds under 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54130, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.4
Demand for payment—notice.
(a) Before offset is made, a written notice will be sent to the debtor. This notice will include:
(1) The type and amount of the debt;
(2) The date when payment is due (not less than thirty days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the notice);
(3) The agency's intention to collect the debt by administrative offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment by the payment due date or has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date;
(4) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the Commission's records related to the claim;
(5) The right of the debtor to request a review of the determination of indebtedness and, in the circumstances described in § 204.7, to request an oral hearing from the Commission's designee; and
(6) The right of the debtor to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt in some other way.
(b) Claims for payment of travel advances and employee training expenses require notification prior to administrative offset as described in this section. Because no oral hearing is required, notice of the right to a hearing
need not be included in the notification.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54130, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.5
Debtor's failure to respond.
If the debtor fails to respond to the notice described in § 204.4(a) by the proposed effective date specified in the notice, the Commission may take further action under this section or under the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 901.3). The commission may collect by administrative offset if the debtor:
(a) Has not made payment by the payment due date;
(b) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set out in § 204.6; or
(c) Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54130, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.6
Agency review.
(a) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of repayment. With respect to debts established by a judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the payment or other discharge of the debt. A request to review a disputed debt must be submitted to the Commission official who provided notification within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written notice described in § 204.4(c).
(b) The Commission will provide a copy of the record to the debtor and advise him/her to furnish available evidence to support his or her position. Upon receipt of the evidence, the written record of indebtedness will be reviewed and the debtor will be informed of the results of that review.
(c) Pending the resolution of a dispute by the debtor, transactions in any of the debtor's accounts maintained by the Commission may be temporarily suspended. Depending on the type of transaction, the suspension could preclude its payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be immediately lifted.
(d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.7
Hearing.
(a) A debtor will be provided a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing by the Commission's designee when:
(1) (i) By statute, consideration must be given to a request to waive the indebtedness;
(ii) The debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness; and
(iii) The waiver determination rests on an issue of credibility or veracity; or
(2) The debtor requests reconsideration and the Commission's designee determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence.
(b) In cases where an oral hearing is provided to the debtor, the Commission's designee will conduct the hearing, and provide the debtor with a written decision 30 days after the hearing.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.8
Written agreement for repayment.
If the debtor requests a repayment agreement in place of offset, the Commission has discretion to determine whether to accept a repayment agreement in place of offset. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the Commission will not accept a repayment agreement in place of offset unless the debtor is able to establish that offset would cause undue financial hardship or be unjust. No repayment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within ten business days of the Commission's request for the statement. At the Commission's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity
with surety may be required for installment agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711-3720E, and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR 900.1-904.4.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.9
Administrative offset procedures.
(a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review within the time specified in § 204.4, or if as a result of the review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance with this subpart without further notice.
(b)
Travel advance.
The Commission will deduct outstanding advances provided to Commission travelers from other amounts owed the traveler by the agency whenever possible and practicable. Monies owed by an employee for outstanding travel advances that cannot be deducted from other travel amounts due that employee will be collected through salary offset as described in subpart B of this part.
(c)
Requests for offset to the Department of the Treasury or other Federal agencies.
The Chairperson (or his or her designee) may notify the Department of the Treasury of delinquent debts for purposes of administrative offset, and may request that a debt owed to the Commission be administratively offset against funds due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency. In requesting administrative offset, the Commission, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor that:
(1) The debtor owes the past due and legally enforceable debt; and
(2) The debtor has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(d)
Requests for offset from other Federal agencies.
Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to such Federal agency by the debtor. The Commission shall initiate the requested offset only upon:
(1) Receipt of written certification from the crecitor agency that:
(i) The debtor owes the past due and legally enforceable debt; and
(ii) The debtor has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(2) A determination by the Commission that collection by offset against funds payable by the Commission would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.
[58 FR 64370, Dec. 7, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.10
[Reserved]
§ 204.11
Jeopardy procedure.
The Commission may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by § 204.4(a) if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize the Commission's ability to collect the debt, and the time available before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset shall be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to the Commission shall be promptly refunded. This section applies only to administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(c), and does not apply when debts are referred to the Department of the Treasury for mandatory centralized administrative offset under 31 CFR 901.3(b)(1).

§ 204.34
Employee response.
(a)
Introduction.
An employee must respond to a pre-offset notice, if at all, within 15 calendar days following receipt, in one or more of the ways discussed in § 204.34, Employee response, and § 204.35, Petition for pre-offset hearing. Where applicable, the employee bears the burdens of proof and persuasion.
(b) Responses must be submitted in writing to the program official who signed the pre-offset notice. A timely response will stay the commencement of collection by salary offset, at least until the issuance of a written decision. (See § 204.37, Extensions of time). Failure to submit a timely response will be treated as an admission of indebtedness, and will result in salary offset in accordance with the terms specified in the pre-offset notice.
(c) A response filed after expiration of the 15 day period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her control or failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it).
(d)
Voluntary repayment agreement.
An employee may request to enter into a voluntary written agreement for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. It is within the discretion of the program official whether to enter into such an agreement, and if so, upon what terms. Voluntary deductions may exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay. If an agreement is reached, the agreement must be in writing, and must be signed by both the employee and the program official. A signed copy must be sent to the Office of Financial Management. The program official shall notify the employee in writing of its decision not to accept the proposed voluntary repayment schedule before making any deductions from the employee's salary.
(e)
Waiver.
Any request for waiver of the debt must be accompanied by evidence that the waiver is authorized by law.
(f)
Reconsideration.
An employee may request reconsideration of the existence or amount of the debt or the offset schedule as reflected in the pre-offset notice. The request must be accompanied by a detailed narrative and supporting documentation as to why the offset decision is erroneous and/or why the offset schedule imposes an undue hardship.
[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 76 FR 60372, Sept. 29, 2011]
§ 204.35
Petition for pre-offset hearing.
(a) The employee may petition for a pre-offset hearing. The petition must state with specificity why the employee believes the agency's determination is in error. To the extent that a debt has not been established by judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a pre-offset hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of repayment. With respect to debts established by a judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a pre-offset hearing concerning the payment or other discharge of the debt.
(b) The petition must fully identify and explain, with reasonable specificity, all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position. The petition must be signed by the employee.
[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.36
Granting of a pre-offset hearing.
(a) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the timeliness is waived, the program official must:
(1) arrange for a hearing official. If the hearing official is an administrative law judge, he or she shall be designated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge as set forth in 17 CFR 200.310(a)(2); and
(2) provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are based.
(b) The hearing official shall notify the employee by personal service, by first class, registered or certified mail, or by a reliable commercial courier or overnight delivery service whether the employee is entitled to an oral or “paper” (
i.e.
, a review on the written record) hearing. (See 31 CFR 901.3(e).) Within 20 calendar days of receipt of this notice the employee shall provide the hearing official with a full description of all relevant facts, documentary evidence, and witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position. The hearing official may extend the time for the employee to respond to the notice for good cause shown.
(c) If an oral hearing is scheduled, the hearing official shall notify the program official and the employee in writing of the date, time and location of the hearing. The place for the hearing shall be fixed by the hearing official with due regard for the public interest and the convenience and necessity of the parties, the participants, or their representatives.
(d) If the employee is entitled to an oral hearing, but requests to have the hearing based only on the written submissions, the employee must notify the hearing official and the program official at least 3 calendar days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause.
(e) Failure of the employee to appear at the oral hearing may result in dismissal of the petition and affirmation of the program official's decision.
[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54131, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.37
Extensions of time.
The hearing official may for good cause or in the interests of justice postpone the commencement of the hearing, adjourn a convened hearing for a reasonable period of time or extend or shorten any other time limits prescribed under this section. This extension is not intended to abridge the 30 day initial notice or extend the 60 day decision requirement other than as provided for in 5 CFR 550.1104(d)(10).
§ 204.38
Pre-offset hearing.
(a) The hearing official shall determine the form and content of hearings granted under this section, pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(e). All oral hearings shall be on the record. Except as otherwise ordered by the hearing official, hearings shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim by shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other method, subject to the discretion and approval of the hearing official, and a transcript thereof shall be made.
(b) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The Commission, represented by an attorney from the Office of General Counsel, and accompanied by a program official and the employee, and/or the employee's representative, orally shall explain their respective positions using relevant documentation. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify where the hearing official determines the testimony to be relevant and not redundant. The Federal Rules of Evidence serve as a guideline, but are not controlling. The employee bears the burdens of proof and persuasion.
(c) The hearing official shall:
(1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing;
(2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum and avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing; and
(3) Issue a decision in accordance with § 204.39, Written decision, on the basis of the oral hearing and the written record.
(d) Oral hearings are normally open to the public. However, the hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing at either the request of either party or upon the hearing official's initiative when doing so is in the best interest[s] of the employee or the public.
(e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call at the request of the
employee or at the discretion of the hearing official.
(f)
Pre-offset “paper” hearing.
If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the hearing official shall issue a decision based solely upon the written record.
[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54132, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.39
Written decision.
(a)
If pre-offset hearing is held.
Within 60 days of the filing of the employee's petition for a pre-offset hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision setting forth the basis of his/her findings in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1104(g)(3).
(b) If the employee challenges the pre-offset notice under § 204.34, Employee response and/or § 204.35, Petition for pre-offset hearing, without requesting a hearing or a hearing is denied, the program official must notify the employee of his/her final determination in writing before offset can begin. The agency's execution of a voluntary repayment agreement satisfies this requirement.
§ 204.40
Deductions.
(a) When deductions may begin:
(1) If a pre-offset hearing is held, deductions shall be made in accordance with the hearing official's decision.
(2) If parties execute a voluntary repayment agreement, deductions shall be made in accordance with the terms of that agreement.
(3) If the employee requests a waiver or reconsideration or the program official refuses to accept a proposed alternate repayment schedule, deductions shall be made in accordance with the program official's written decision.
(4) If the employee consents to the terms and conditions set forth in the Commission's Pre-offset Notice or fails to respond in timely fashion to the Pre-offset Notice, or waives his/her right to a hearing without otherwise challenging the terms of the Pre-offset Notice, deductions shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein.
(b)
Retired or separated employees.
If the employee retires, resigns, or is terminated before the debt is fully repaid, the remaining indebtedness will be offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS.
(1) To the extent possible, the remaining indebtedness will be liquidated from any final payment due the former employee as of the date of separation (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.). See § 204.40d(3), Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum leave payment.
(2) Thereafter, the remaining indebtedness will be recovered from later payments of any kind due the former employee from the United States. See the FCCS.
(c)
Method of collection and source of deduction.
The method of collecting debts under these regulations shall be by salary offset. Deductions will be made from the employee's current disposable pay account except as provided for in § 204.34b, Employee response.
(d)
Amount and duration of deductions.
Debts must be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee demonstrates financial hardship to the Commission's satisfaction or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of the indebted employee's current disposable pay, collection must be made in installments over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active employment, except as provided in Section 34b, Employee Response.
(1) Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay.
(2) The amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. Installment payment of less than $100 per pay period will he accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.
(3) Offset deductions from final salary and/or lump-sum leave payment. Such an offset deduction may exceed 15 percent of an employee's final salary and/or lump-sum leave payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, 64 CG 907.
(e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this part
will be assessed and/or waived according to the provisions of 31 CFR 901.9.
[58 FR 38520, July 19, 1993, as amended at 66 FR 54132, Oct. 26, 2001]
§ 204.41
Non-waiver of rights.
An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.
§ 204.42
Refunds.
(a) The Commission will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts offset under this regulation when:
(1) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
(2) The Commission is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
(b) Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law or contract.
§ 204.43
Coordinating offset with another federal agency.
(a)
Responsibility of the Commission as the Creditor Agency.
When possible, salary offset through the centralized administrative offset procedures in 5 CFR 550.1108 shall be attempted before applying the procedures in this section. If centralized administrative offset is not possible, the Commission shall request recovery from the current paying agency. Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, 5 CFR 550.1109 the Commission must:
(1) Certify, in writing, that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued and that the Commission's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by OPM.
(2) If the collection must be made in installments, the Commission also must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment, and if the Commission wishes, the number and the commencing date of the installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required).
(3) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) the action(s) was taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency).
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(4), the Commission must submit a debt claim containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section and an installment agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, to the employee's paying agency.
(5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission must submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in 5 CFR 550.1104(l). Pursuant to 5 CFR 1101, the paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify the creditor agency and employee. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the paying agency has fully complied with the provisions of this section. The Commission must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.
(6) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Commission may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other
similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt (See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).
(7) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Commission shall not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and subpart B of this part to resume the collection. The Commission must review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency. The Commission must submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed.
(b)
Responsibility of the Commission as the paying agency
—(1)
Complete claim.
When the Commission receives a properly certified claim from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The Commission must notify the employee in writing that the Commission has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency (including the amount) and the date salary offset will begin and the amount of such deductions.
(2)
Incomplete claim.
When the Commission receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Commission must return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and subpart B of this part must be provided and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.
(3)
Review.
The Commission is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
(4)
Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.
If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Commission and before the Commission collects the debt in full, the employee transfers to another agency, the Commission must certify the total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee and one copy to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.
(c)
Responsibility of the Program Official.
(1) The Program Official shall coordinate debt collections and shall, as appropriate:
(i) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petition by a federal employee; and
(ii) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, such practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this regulation.
(2) The Program Official shall be responsible for:
(i) Ensuring that each certification of debt sent to a paying agency is consistent with the pre-offset notice (§ 204.33, Pre-offset notice).
(ii) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to § 204.36, Granting of a pre-offset hearing.
(iii) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.

§ 204.60
Purpose.
This subpart provides procedures for the Commission to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment to satisfy a delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States.
§ 204.61
Scope.
(a) The receipt of payments pursuant to this subpart does not preclude the Commission from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy a delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States. The Commission may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment.
(b) This subpart does not apply to the collection of delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws.
§ 204.62
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this subpart:
Debt
or
delinquent nontax debt
means any money, funds or property that has been determined to be owed to the Commission by an individual that has not been paid by the date specified in the demand or order for payment, or applicable agreement. For purposes of this subpart, the terms “debt” and “claim” are synonymous.
Disposable pay
means that part of the debtor's compensation (including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For purposes of this subpart, “amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.
Employer
means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government.
Garnishment
means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order.
Withholding order
means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by an agency, or judicial or administrative body. For purposes of this subpart, the terms “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”
§ 204.63
Notice.
(a) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the Commission will mail, by first class mail to the debtor's last known address, a written notice informing the debtor of:
(1) The nature and amount of the debt;
(2) The Commission's intention to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and
(3) An explanation of the debtor's rights, including those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and the time frame within which the debtor may exercise these rights.
(b) The debtor will be afforded the opportunity:
(1) To inspect and copy records related to the debt;
(2) To enter into a written repayment agreement with the Commission, under terms agreeable to the Commission; and
(3) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by judicial or administrative order, to request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the debt's repayment schedule. With respect to debts established by a judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the payment or other discharge of the debt. The debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c) The notice required by this section may be included with the Commission's demand letter required by subpart A of this part.
(d) The Commission will keep a copy of the certificate of service indicating the date of mailing of the notice.
§ 204.64
Hearing.
(a)
Request for hearing.
The Commission will order a hearing, which at the Commission's option may be oral or written, if the debtor submits a written request for a hearing concerning, for debts not previously established by judicial or administrative order, the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment schedules established other than by written agreement under § 204.63(b)(2)), or for debts established by judicial or administrative order, the payment or other discharge of the debt.
(b)
Type of hearing or review.
(1) For purposes of this subpart, whenever the Commission is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the Commission determined that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.
(2) If the Commission determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by the Commission. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.
(3) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Commission will nevertheless accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, the Commission will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record.
(c)
Effect of timely request.
Subject to paragraph (l) of this section, if the debtor's written request is received by the Commission on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment, the Commission will not issue a withholding order until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing, and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section has been rendered.
(d)
Failure to timely request a hearing.
If the debtor's written request is received by the agency after the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment, the Commission shall provide a hearing to the debtor. However, the Commission will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the Commission determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or the Commission receives information that the Commission believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.
(e)
Hearing official.
All hearings shall be presided over by the Commission, or if the Commission so orders, by a hearing official. When the Commission designates that the hearing official shall be an administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall
select, pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-10, the administrative law judge to preside.
(f)
Procedure.
After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the debtor of:
(1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;
(2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or
(3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written hearing.
(g)
Burden of proof.
(1) The Commission will have the burden of going forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.
(2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
(h)
Record.
The hearing official will maintain a record of any hearing provided under this section. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.
(i)
Date of decision.
The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such hearing was received by the Commission. If the Commission is unable to provide the debtor with a hearing and a decision is not rendered within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request for such hearing:
(1) A withholding order will not be issued until the hearing is held and a decision rendered; or
(2) If a withholding order had previously been issued to the debtor's employer, the withholding order will be suspended beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.
(j)
Content of decision.
The written decision shall include:
(1) A summary of the facts presented;
(2) The findings, analysis and conclusions; and
(3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
(k)
Finality of agency action.
Unless the Commission on its own initiative orders review of a decision by a hearing official pursuant to 17 CFR 201.431(c), a decision by a hearing official shall become the final decision of the Commission for the purpose of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.
(l)
Failure to appear.
In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at a scheduled hearing will be deemed as not having timely filed a request for a hearing.
§ 204.65
Wage garnishment order.
(a) Unless the Commission receives information that the Commission believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the Commission will send, by first class mail, a withholding order to the debtor's employer within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (
i.e.
, within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice of the Commission's intent to seek garnishment) or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a decision to issue a withholding order becomes final.
(b) The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Commission's letterhead, and signed by the Chairperson or his or her delegatee. The order will contain the information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. This information includes the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.
(c) The Commission will keep a copy of the certificate of service indicating the date of mailing of the order.
(d)
Certification by employer.
Along with the withholding order, the Commission will send to the employer a certification in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete and return the certification to the Commission within
the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.
(e)
Amounts withheld.
(1) After receipt of the garnishment order issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(2) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:
(i) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay; or
(ii) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment). The amount set forth at U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage
See
29 CFR 870.10.
(3) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following shall apply:
(i) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and shall have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. However, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this section.
(ii) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the lesser of:
(A) The amount calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; or
(B) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.
(iii) If a debtor owes more than one debt to the Commission, the Commission may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(4) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.
(5) The employer shall promptly pay to the Commission all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this section.
(6) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.
(7) Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.
(8) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from the Commission to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.
(f)
Exclusions from garnishment.
The Commission will not garnish the wages of a debtor it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing the Commission of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.
(g)
Financial hardship.
(1) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a review by the Commission of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.
(2) A debtor requesting a review under this section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current
amount of garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.
(3) If a financial hardship is found, the Commission will downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the Commission, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. The Commission will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.
(h)
Ending garnishment.
(2) Once the Commission has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 901.9), the Commission will send the debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.
(2) At least annually, the Commission will review its debtors' accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that have been paid in full.
(i)
Actions prohibited by the employer.
The Debt Collection Act prohibits an employer from discharging, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a withholding order under this section (31 U.S.C. 3720D(e)).
(j)
Refunds.
(1) If a hearing official determines that a debt is not legally due and owing to the United States, the Commission shall promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage garnishment.
(2) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this section shall not bear interest.
(k)
Right of action.
The Commission may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with this section. However, a suit will not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. For purposes of this section, “termination of the collection action” occurs when the agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR 903.1-903.5) or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if the Commission has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

This part sets forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer. These standards supplement applicable standards of any jurisdiction where an attorney is admitted or practices and are not intended to limit the ability of any jurisdiction to impose additional obligations on an attorney not inconsistent with the application of this part. Where the standards of a state or other United States jurisdiction where an attorney is admitted or practices conflict with this part, this part shall govern.
§ 205.2

§ 205.3
Issuer as client.
(a)
Representing an issuer.
An attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer owes his or her professional and ethical duties to the issuer as an organization. That the attorney may work with and advise the issuer's officers, directors, or employees in the course of representing the issuer does not make such individuals the attorney's clients.
(b)
Duty to report evidence of a material violation.
(1) If an attorney, appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer, becomes aware of evidence of a material violation by the issuer or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of the issuer, the attorney shall report such evidence to the issuer's chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) or to both the issuer's chief legal officer and its chief executive officer (or the equivalents thereof) forthwith. By communicating such information to the issuer's officers or directors, an attorney does not reveal client confidences or secrets or privileged or otherwise protected information related to the attorney's representation of an issuer.
(2) The chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) shall cause such inquiry into the evidence of a material violation as he or she reasonably believes is appropriate to determine whether the material violation described in the report has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur. If the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) determines no material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, he or she shall notify the reporting attorney and advise the reporting attorney of the basis for such determination. Unless the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) reasonably believes that no material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, he or she shall take all reasonable steps to cause the issuer to adopt an appropriate response, and shall advise the reporting attorney thereof. In lieu of causing an inquiry under this paragraph (b), a chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) may refer a report of evidence of a material violation to a qualified legal compliance committee under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the issuer has duly established a qualified legal compliance committee prior to the report of evidence of a material violation.
(3) Unless an attorney who has made a report under paragraph (b)(1) of this section reasonably believes that the chief legal officer or the chief executive officer of the issuer (or the equivalent thereof) has provided an appropriate response within a reasonable time, the attorney shall report the evidence of a material violation to:
(i) The audit committee of the issuer's board of directors;
(ii) Another committee of the issuer's board of directors consisting solely of
directors who are not employed, directly or indirectly, by the issuer and are not, in the case of a registered investment company, “interested persons” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19)) (if the issuer's board of directors has no audit committee); or
(iii) The issuer's board of directors (if the issuer's board of directors has no committee consisting solely of directors who are not employed, directly or indirectly, by the issuer and are not, in the case of a registered investment company, “interested persons” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19))).
(4) If an attorney reasonably believes that it would be futile to report evidence of a material violation to the issuer's chief legal officer and chief executive officer (or the equivalents thereof) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attorney may report such evidence as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(5) An attorney retained or directed by an issuer to investigate evidence of a material violation reported under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section shall be deemed to be appearing and practicing before the Commission. Directing or retaining an attorney to investigate reported evidence of a material violation does not relieve an officer or director of the issuer to whom such evidence has been reported under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section from a duty to respond to the reporting attorney.
(6) An attorney shall not have any obligation to report evidence of a material violation under this paragraph (b) if:
(i) The attorney was retained or directed by the issuer's chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) to investigate such evidence of a material violation and:
(A) The attorney reports the results of such investigation to the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof); and
(B) Except where the attorney and the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) each reasonably believes that no material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) reports the results of the investigation to the issuer's board of directors, a committee thereof to whom a report could be made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or a qualified legal compliance committee; or
(ii) The attorney was retained or directed by the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) to assert, consistent with his or her professional obligations, a colorable defense on behalf of the issuer (or the issuer's officer, director, employee, or agent, as the case may be) in any investigation or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to such evidence of a material violation, and the chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) provides reasonable and timely reports on the progress and outcome of such proceeding to the issuer's board of directors, a committee thereof to whom a report could be made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or a qualified legal compliance committee.
(7) An attorney shall not have any obligation to report evidence of a material violation under this paragraph (b) if such attorney was retained or directed by a qualified legal compliance committee:
(i) To investigate such evidence of a material violation; or
(ii) To assert, consistent with his or her professional obligations, a colorable defense on behalf of the issuer (or the issuer's officer, director, employee, or agent, as the case may be) in any investigation or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to such evidence of a material violation.
(8) An attorney who receives what he or she reasonably believes is an appropriate and timely response to a report he or she has made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section need do nothing more under this section with respect to his or her report.
(9) An attorney who does not reasonably believe that the issuer has made an appropriate response within a reasonable time to the report or reports made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section shall explain his or her reasons therefor to the chief legal officer (or the equivalent
thereof), the chief executive officer (or the equivalent thereof), and directors to whom the attorney reported the evidence of a material violation pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.
(10) An attorney formerly employed or retained by an issuer who has reported evidence of a material violation under this part and reasonably believes that he or she has been discharged for so doing may notify the issuer's board of directors or any committee thereof that he or she believes that he or she has been discharged for reporting evidence of a material violation under this section.
(c)
Alternative reporting procedures for attorneys retained or employed by an issuer that has established a qualified legal compliance committee.
(1) If an attorney, appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer, becomes aware of evidence of a material violation by the issuer or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of the issuer, the attorney may, as an alternative to the reporting requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, report such evidence to a qualified legal compliance committee, if the issuer has previously formed such a committee. An attorney who reports evidence of a material violation to such a qualified legal compliance committee has satisfied his or her obligation to report such evidence and is not required to assess the issuer's response to the reported evidence of a material violation.
(2) A chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) may refer a report of evidence of a material violation to a previously established qualified legal compliance committee in lieu of causing an inquiry to be conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) shall inform the reporting attorney that the report has been referred to a qualified legal compliance committee. Thereafter, pursuant to the requirements under § 205.2(k), the qualified legal compliance committee shall be responsible for responding to the evidence of a material violation reported to it under this paragraph (c).
(d)
Issuer confidences.
(1) Any report under this section (or the contemporaneous record thereof) or any response thereto (or the contemporaneous record thereof) may be used by an attorney in connection with any investigation, proceeding, or litigation in which the attorney's compliance with this part is in issue.
(2) An attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer may reveal to the Commission, without the issuer's consent, confidential information related to the representation to the extent the attorney reasonably believes necessary:
(i) To prevent the issuer from committing a material violation that is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the issuer or investors;
(ii) To prevent the issuer, in a Commission investigation or administrative proceeding from committing perjury, proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1621; suborning perjury, proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1622; or committing any act proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1001 that is likely to perpetrate a fraud upon the Commission; or
(iii) To rectify the consequences of a material violation by the issuer that caused, or may cause, substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the issuer or investors in the furtherance of which the attorney's services were used.
§ 205.4
Responsibilities of supervisory attorneys.
(a) An attorney supervising or directing another attorney who is appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer is a supervisory attorney. An issuer's chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof) is a supervisory attorney under this section.
(b) A supervisory attorney shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that a subordinate attorney, as defined in § 205.5(a), that he or she supervises or directs conforms to this part. To the extent a subordinate attorney appears and practices before the Commission in the representation of an issuer, that subordinate attorney's supervisory attorneys also appear and practice before the Commission.
(c) A supervisory attorney is responsible for complying with the reporting requirements in § 205.3 when a subordinate attorney has reported to the supervisory attorney evidence of a material violation.
(d) A supervisory attorney who has received a report of evidence of a material violation from a subordinate attorney under § 205.3 may report such evidence to the issuer's qualified legal compliance committee if the issuer has duly formed such a committee.
§ 205.5
Responsibilities of a subordinate attorney.
(a) An attorney who appears and practices before the Commission in the representation of an issuer on a matter under the supervision or direction of another attorney (other than under the direct supervision or direction of the issuer's chief legal officer (or the equivalent thereof)) is a subordinate attorney.
(b) A subordinate attorney shall comply with this part notwithstanding that the subordinate attorney acted at the direction of or under the supervision of another person.
(c) A subordinate attorney complies with § 205.3 if the subordinate attorney reports to his or her supervising attorney under § 205.3(b) evidence of a material violation of which the subordinate attorney has become aware in appearing and practicing before the Commission.
(d) A subordinate attorney may take the steps permitted or required by § 205.3(b) or (c) if the subordinate attorney reasonably believes that a supervisory attorney to whom he or she has reported evidence of a material violation under § 205.3(b) has failed to comply with § 205.3.
§ 205.6
Sanctions and discipline.
(a) A violation of this part by any attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission in the representation of an issuer shall subject such attorney to the civil penalties and remedies for a violation of the federal securities laws available to the Commission in an action brought by the Commission thereunder.
(b) An attorney appearing and practicing before the Commission who violates any provision of this part is subject to the disciplinary authority of the Commission, regardless of whether the attorney may also be subject to discipline for the same conduct in a jurisdiction where the attorney is admitted or practices. An administrative disciplinary proceeding initiated by the Commission for violation of this part may result in an attorney being censured, or being temporarily or permanently denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission.
(c) An attorney who complies in good faith with the provisions of this part shall not be subject to discipline or otherwise liable under inconsistent standards imposed by any state or other United States jurisdiction where the attorney is admitted or practices.
(d) An attorney practicing outside the United States shall not be required to comply with the requirements of this part to the extent that such compliance is prohibited by applicable foreign law.
§ 205.7
No private right of action.
(a) Nothing in this part is intended to, or does, create a private right of action against any attorney, law firm, or issuer based upon compliance or noncompliance with its provisions.
(b) Authority to enforce compliance with this part is vested exclusively in the Commission.

§ 209.1
Form D-A: Disclosure of assets and financial information.
(a) Rules 410 and 630 of the Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.410 and 201.630) provide that under certain circumstances a respondent who asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be required to disclose certain financial information. Unless otherwise ordered, this form may be used by individuals required to supply such information.
(b) The respondent filing Form D-A is required promptly to notify the Commission of any material change in the answer to any question on this form.
(c) Form D-A may not be withheld from the interested division. A respondent making financial information disclosures on this form after the institution of proceedings may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322 of the Commission's Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.322), for the issuance of a protective order to limit disclosure to the public or parties other than the interested division of the information submitted on Form D-A. A request for a protective order allows the requester an opportunity to justify the need for confidentiality. The making of a motion for a protective order, however, does not guarantee that disclosure will be limited.
(d) No party receiving information for which a motion for a protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other person prior to a ruling on the motion without the prior permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.
(e) A person making financial information disclosures on Form D-A prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with an offer of settlement or otherwise, may request confidential treatment of the information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.
See
the Commission's Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) regulations, 17 CFR 200.83. A request for confidential treatment allows the requester an opportunity to substantiate the need for confidentiality. No determination as to the validity of any request for confidential treatment will be made until a request for disclosure of the information under FOIA is received.

(1) The term
significant subsidiary
means a subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which meets any of the conditions in paragraph (w)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section; however if the registrant is a registered investment company or a business development company, the tested subsidiary meets any of the conditions in paragraph (w)(2) of this section instead of any of the conditions in this paragraph (w)(1). In an acquisition by a predecessor to a shell company, use the predecessor's consolidated financial statements instead of those of the shell company registrant in applying the significance tests in paragraphs (w)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. A registrant that files its financial statements in accordance with or provides a reconciliation to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) must use amounts determined under U.S. GAAP. A foreign private issuer that files its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB) must use amounts determined under IFRS-IASB.(
(i)
Investment test.
(A) For acquisitions, other than those described in paragraph (w)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and dispositions this test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to
the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, or if the registrant has no such aggregate worldwide market value the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(
1
) For acquisitions, the “investments in” the tested subsidiary is the consideration transferred, adjusted to exclude the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate interest in the carrying value of assets transferred by the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated to the tested subsidiary that will remain with the combined entity after the acquisition. It must include the fair value of contingent consideration if required to be recognized at fair value by the registrant at the acquisition date under U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB, as applicable; however if recognition at fair value is not required, it must include all contingent consideration, except contingent consideration for which the likelihood of payment is remote.
(
2
) For dispositions, the “investments in” the tested subsidiary is the fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration, for the disposed subsidiary when comparing to the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, or, when the registrant has no such aggregate worldwide market value, the carrying value of the disposed subsidiary when comparing to total assets of the registrant.
(
3
) When determining the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, use the average of such aggregate worldwide market value calculated daily for the last five trading days of the registrant's most recently completed month ending prior to the earlier of the registrant's announcement date or agreement date of the acquisition or disposition.
(B) For a combination between entities or businesses under common control, this test is met when either the net book value of the tested subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of the registrant's and its subsidiaries' consolidated total assets or the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at the date the combination is initiated.
(C) In all other cases, this test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(ii)
Asset test.
This test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share of the tested subsidiary's consolidated total assets (after intercompany eliminations) exceeds 10 percent of such total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(iii)
Income test.
(A) This test is met when:
(
1
) The absolute value of the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the tested subsidiary's consolidated income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interests exceeds 10 percent of the absolute value of such income or loss of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year; and
(
2
) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share of the tested subsidiary's consolidated total revenue from continuing operations (after intercompany eliminations) exceeds 10 percent of such total revenue of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year. This paragraph (w)(1)(iii)(A)(
2
) does not apply if either the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary did not have material revenue in each of the two most recently completed fiscal years.
(B) When determining the income component in paragraph (w)(1)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section:
(
1
) If a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interest has been incurred by either the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated or the tested
subsidiary, but not both, exclude the equity in the income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) of the tested subsidiary attributable to the controlling interest from such income or loss of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for purposes of the computation;
(
2
) Compute the test using the average described in this paragraph (w)(1)(iii)(B)(
2
) if the revenue component in paragraph (w)(1)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section does not apply and the absolute value of the registrant's and its subsidiaries' consolidated income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interests for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the absolute value of such amounts for each of its last five fiscal years; and
(
3
) Entities reporting losses must not be aggregated with entities reporting income where the test involves combined entities, as in the case of determining whether summarized financial data must be presented or whether the aggregate impact specified in §§ 210.3-05(b)(2)(iv) and 210.3-14(b)(2)(i)(C) is met, except when determining whether related businesses meet this test for purposes of §§ 210.3-05 and 210.8-04.
(2) For a registrant that is a registered investment company or a business development company, the term
significant subsidiary
means a subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which meets any of the following conditions using amounts determined under U.S. GAAP and, if applicable, section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41)):
(i)
Investment test.
The value of the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the value of the total investments of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year; or
(ii)
Income test.
The absolute value of the sum of combined investment income from dividends, interest, and other income, the net realized gains and losses on investments, and the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investments from the tested subsidiary (except, for purposes of § 210.6-11, the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the tested subsidiary), for the most recently completed fiscal year exceeds:
(A) 80 percent of the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year; or
(B) 10 percent of the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year and the investment test (paragraph (w)(2)(i) of this section) condition exceeds 5 percent. However, if the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the absolute value of such amounts for each of its last five fiscal years, then the registrant may compute both conditions of the income test using the average of the absolute value of such amounts for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for each of its last five fiscal years.
(x)
Subsidiary.
A
subsidiary
of a specified person is an affiliate controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.
(y)
Totally held subsidiary.
The term
totally held subsidiary
means a subsidiary (1) substantially all of whose outstanding equity securities are owned by its parent and/or the parent's other totally held subsidiaries, and (2) which is not indebted to any person other than its parent and/or the parent's other totally held subsidiaries, in an amount which is material in relation to the particular subsidiary, excepting indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which is not overdue and which matures within 1 year from the date of its creation, whether evidenced by securities or not. Indebtedness of a subsidiary which is secured by its parent by guarantee, pledge, assignment, or otherwise is to be excluded for purposes of paragraph (x)(2) of this section.
(z)
Voting shares.
The term
voting shares
means the sum of all rights,
other than as affected by events of default, to vote for election of directors and/or the sum of all interests in an unincorporated person.
(aa)
Wholly owned subsidiary.
The term
wholly owned subsidiary
means a subsidiary substantially all of whose outstanding voting shares are owned by its parent and/or the parent's other wholly owned subsidiaries.
(bb)
Summarized financial information.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (bb)(2) of this section,
summarized financial information
referred to in this part shall mean the presentation of summarized information as to the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity for which the information is required. Summarized financial information shall include the following disclosures, which may be subject to appropriate variation to conform to the nature of the entity's business:
(i) Current assets, noncurrent assets, current liabilities, noncurrent liabilities, and, when applicable, redeemable preferred stocks (see § 210.5-02.27) and noncontrolling interests (for specialized industries in which classified balance sheets are normally not presented, information shall be provided as to the nature and amount of the majority components of assets and liabilities);
(ii) Net sales or gross revenues, gross profit (or, alternatively, costs and expenses applicable to net sales or gross revenues), income or loss from continuing operations, net income or loss, and net income or loss attributable to the entity (for specialized industries, other information may be substituted for sales and related costs and expenses if necessary for a more meaningful presentation); and
(2) Summarized financial information for unconsolidated subsidiaries and 50 percent or less owned persons referred to in and required by § 210.10-01(b) for interim periods shall include the information required by paragraph (bb)(1)(ii) of this section.
(cc)
Statement(s) of comprehensive income.
The term
statement(s) of comprehensive income
means a financial statement that includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income comprises all components of net income and all components of other comprehensive income. The statement of comprehensive income may be presented either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. A statement(s) of operations or variations thereof may be used in place of a statement(s) of comprehensive income if there was no other comprehensive income during the period(s).
(dd)
Restricted net assets.
The term
restricted net assets
shall mean that amount of the registrant's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party (
i.e.,
lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.). Not all limitations on transferability of assets are considered to be restrictions for purposes of this rule, which considers only specific third party restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds outside of the entity. For example, the presence of subsidiary debt which is secured by certain of the subsidiary's assets does not constitute a restriction under this rule. However, if there are any loan provisions prohibiting dividend payments, loans or advances to the parent by a subsidiary, these are considered restrictions for purposes of computing restricted net assets. When a loan agreement requires that a subsidiary maintain certain working capital, net tangible asset, or net asset levels, or where formal compensating arrangements exist, there is considered to be a restriction under the rule because the lender's intent is normally to preclude the transfer by dividend or otherwise of funds to the parent company. Similarly, a provision which requires that a subsidiary reinvest all of its earnings is a restriction, since this precludes loans, advances or dividends in the amount of such undistributed earnings by the entity. Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from
the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (§ 210.5-02.27) and noncontrolling interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.

# Qualifications and Reports of Accountants

# Source:
Sections 210.2-01 through 210.2-05 appear at 37 FR 14594, July 21, 1972, unless otherwise noted.
§ 210.2-01
Qualifications of accountants.
Section 210.2-01 is designed to ensure that auditors are qualified and independent of their audit clients both in fact and in appearance. Accordingly, the rule sets forth restrictions on financial, employment, and business relationships between an accountant and an audit client and restrictions on an accountant providing certain non-audit services to an audit client. Section 210.2-01(b) sets forth the general standard of auditor independence. Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section reflect the application of the general standard to particular circumstances. The rule does not purport to, and the Commission could not, consider all circumstances that raise independence concerns, and these are subject to the general standard in § 210.2-01(b). In considering this standard, the Commission looks in the first instance to whether a relationship or the provision of a service: Creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the accountant and the audit client; places the accountant in the position of auditing his or her own work; results in the accountant acting as management or an employee of the audit client; or places the accountant in a position of being an advocate for the audit client. These factors are general guidance only, and their application may depend on particular facts and circumstances. For that reason, § 210.2-01(b) provides that, in determining whether an accountant is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. For the same reason, registrants and accountants are encouraged to consult with the Commission's Office of the Chief Accountant before entering into relationships, including relationships involving the provision of services that are not explicitly described in the rule.
(a) The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office. The Commission will not recognize any person as a public accountant who is not in good standing and entitled to practice as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office.
(b) The Commission will not recognize an accountant as independent, with respect to an audit client, if the accountant is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the accountant is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the accountant's engagement. In determining whether an accountant is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant circumstances, including all relationships between the accountant and the audit client, and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission.
(c) This paragraph sets forth a non-exclusive specification of circumstances inconsistent with paragraph (b) of this section.
