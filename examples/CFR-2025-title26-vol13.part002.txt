(v) If the first tier corporation and the lower tier corporation do not use the same taxable year, and if there would be a reduction in the person's tentative ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits of the lower tier corporation attributable to the taxable year of the first tier corporation by an amount computed under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph in respect of a taxable year of the lower tier corporation (were the taxable years of such corporations the same), then such person's tentative ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year of the lower tier corporation attributable to such taxable year of the first tier corporation shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to (
a
) such amount, as (
b
) the number of days in the taxable year of the lower tier corporation which fall within the taxable year of the first tier corporation, bears to (
c
) the total number of days in the taxable year of the first tier corporation.
(vi) If the lower tier corporation was a less developed country corporation as defined in section 902(d) for a taxable year of the corporation, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)
Lower tier corporation a less developed country corporation
—(1)
General.
If the lower tier corporation was a less developed country corporation as defined in section 902(d) for a taxable year of such corporation, and if the person who sold or exchanged a share (or block) of stock in the first tier corporation satisfies on the date of such sale or exchange:
(i) The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1248-5 with respect to such stock, and
(ii) The requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1248-5 with respect to any stock of the lower tier corporation which such person, by reason of his direct ownership of such stock in the first tier corporation, owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2),
Then such person's ratable share (or a deficit in such ratable share) for such taxable year of the lower tier corporation attributable to a taxable year of the first tier corporation (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by an amount computed by multiplying such ratable share (so determined without regard to this paragraph) by the percentage computed under either subparagraph (2) or (4) of this paragraph, whichever is applicable.
(2)
Percentage for second tier corporation.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, if stock of a lower tier corporation (hereinafter referred to as a
second tier
corporation) is owned directly by the first tier corporation on the date of the sale or exchange referred to in such subparagraph (1), the percentage under this subparagraph shall be computed by dividing (i) the number of shares of stock of the second tier corporation which the first tier corporation has owned directly for an uninterrupted 10-year period ending on such date, by (ii) the total number of shares of the stock of such second tier corporation owned directly by such first tier corporation on such date.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1966, Smith, a United States person, recognizes gain upon the sale of one share of the only class of stock of F Corporation, which he has owned continuously since 1955. He includes a portion of the gain in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a). On January 1, 1966, F owns directly 60 shares of the 100 outstanding shares of the only class of stock of G Corporation, which F acquired in 1955 and owned continuously until such sale. F uses a taxable year ending June 30, and G uses the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1964, G was a less developed country corporation, and on each day of 1964 G was a controlled foreign corporation. Smith's ratable share for G's taxable year ending December 31, 1964, attributable to F's taxable year ending June 30, 1965 (determined without regard to this paragraph) is $6.00. Since the percentage computed under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is 100 percent (60 shares divided by 60 shares), Smith's ratable share for G's taxable year ending December 31, 1964, attributable to F's taxable year ending June 30, 1965 (after the application of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) is zero (that is, $6.00 reduced by 100 percent of $6.00).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that of the 60 shares of G Corporation which F Corporation owned on January 1, 1966, 20 shares were acquired in 1961. The percentage computed under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is 66
2/3
percent (40 shares divided by 60 shares). Accordingly, Smith's ratable share for G's taxable year ending December 31, 1964, attributable to F's taxable year ending June 30, 1965 (after the application of subparagraph (2) or this paragraph) is $2.00 (that is, $6.00 reduced by 66
2/3
percent of $6.00).
(4)
Percentage for lower tier corporations other than second tier corporation.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, if stock of a lower tier corporation (other than a second tier corporation) is owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) by the first tier corporation on the date of the sale or exchange referred to in such subparagraph (1), the percentage under this subparagraph shall be computed in the following manner:
(i) First, determine the percentage for the second tier corporation in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(ii) Second, determine a partial percentage for each other lower tier corporation in the same manner as the percentage for the second tier corporation is determined. Thus, for example, the partial percentage for a third tier corporation is determined by dividing (
a
) the number of shares of stock of the third tier corporation which the second tier corporation has owned directly for an uninterrupted 10-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, by (
b
) the total number of shares of stock of such third tier corporation owned directly by such second tier corporation on such date.
(iii) Third, the percentage for a third tier corporation is the percentage for the second tier corporation multiplied by the partial percentage for the third tier corporation. The percentage for a fourth tier corporation is the percentage for the third tier corporation (as determined in the preceding sentence) multiplied by the partial percentage for the fourth tier corporation. In a similar manner, the percentage for any other lower tier corporation may be determined.
(5)
Example.
The application of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
On January 1, 1967, Brown, a United States person recognizes gain upon the sale of one share of the only class of stock of W Corporation, which he has owned continuously since 1955. He includes a portion of the gain in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a). W is the first tier corporation of a chain of foreign corporations W, X, Y, and Z. W and Z each use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1964, Z was a less developed country corporation and on each day of 1964 Z was a controlled foreign corporation. Additional facts are set forth in the table below:
Corporation—(1)
Shares directly owned

(6)
Special rule.
For purposes of applying the provisions of this paragraph, a lower tier corporation may be treated as a second tier corporation with respect to any of its stock which is owned directly by a first tier corporation whereas such lower tier corporation may be treated as a lower tier corporation other than a second tier corporation with respect to other stock in such lower tier corporation which is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)) by such first tier corporation. Thus, for example, if corporations X, Y, and Z are foreign corporations, X is a first tier corporation owning directly 100 percent of the stock of Y and 40 percent of the stock of Z, and in addition Y owns directly 60 percent of the stock of Z, then the 40 percent of the Z stock (which X owns directly) is considered to be stock in a second tier corporation and the 60 percent of the Z stock (which Y owns directly and which X is considered to own within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)) is considered to be stock in a third tier corporation.

§ 1.1248-4
Limitation on tax applicable to individuals.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Limitation on tax.
Under section 1248(b), if during a taxable year an individual sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation, then in respect of the stock the increase in the individual's income tax liability for such taxable year which is attributable (under paragraph (b) of this section) to the amount included in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall not be greater than an amount equal to the sum of:
(i) The excess, computed under paragraph (c) of this section in respect of the stock of the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by the corporation, plus.
(ii) An amount equal to the increase in the individual's income tax liability which would be attributable to the inclusion in his gross income for such taxable year, as long-term capital gain, of an amount equal to the excess of (
a
) the amount included in the individual's gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) in respect of such stock, over (
b
) the excess referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(2)
Share or block.
In general, the limitation on tax attributable (under paragraph (b) of this section) to the amount included in an individual's gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall be determined separately for each share of stock sold or exchanged. However, such determination may be made in respect of a block of stock if earnings and profits attributable to the block are computed under § 1.1248-2 or 1.1248-3. See paragraph (b) of § 1.1248-2 and paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1248-3.
(3)
Application of limitation.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply unless the individual establishes:
(i) In the manner prescribed in § 1.1248-7, the amount of the earnings and profits of the corporation attributable under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1248-2 or under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1248-3, whichever is applicable, to the stock, and
(ii) The amount equal to the sum described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, computed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(4)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
On December 31, 1966, Smith, a United States person, sells a share of stock of X Corporation which he has owned continuously since December 31, 1965, and includes $100 of the gain on the sale in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a). Both X and Smith use the calendar year as the taxable year. The increase in Smith's income tax liability for 1966 which is attributable (under paragraph (b) of this section) to the inclusion of the $100 in his gross income as a dividend is $70. X was a controlled foreign corporation on each day of 1966. The excess computed under paragraph (c) of this section in respect of the share, of the United States taxes which X would have paid over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by X is $49. Under section 1248(b), the limitation on the tax attributable to the $100 included by Smith in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) is $61.75, computed as follows:
(i) Excess, computed under paragraph (c) of this section, of United States taxes which X Corporation would have paid in 1966 over the taxes actually paid by X in 1966
$49.00
(ii) The amount determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph:
The amount Smith included in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a)
$100.00
Less the excess referred to in subdivision (i) of this example

(b)
Tax attributable to amount treated as dividend
—(1)
General.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in respect of a share (or block) of stock in a foreign corporation sold or exchanged by an individual during a taxable year, the tax attributable to the amount included in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to (i) the excess of (
a
) his income tax liability for the taxable year determined without regard to section 1248(b) over (
b
) such tax liability determined as if the portion of the total gain recognized during the taxable year which is treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) had not been recognized, as (ii) the amount included as a dividend under section 1248(a) in respect of the share (or block), bears to (iii) the total amount included as a dividend under section 1248(a) in the individual's gross income for such taxable year.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) During 1963, Brown, an unmarried United States person, sells a block of stock in a controlled foreign corporation. On the sale, he recognizes $22,000 gain, of which $18,000 is treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) and $4,000 as long-term capital gain. Brown computes his income tax liability for his taxable year ending December 31, 1963, under section 1201 (relating to alternative tax) in accordance with the additional facts assumed in the following table:

(ii) The tax attributable to the $18,000 treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) is $11,466 ($170,833 minus $159,367).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the $18,000 treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) is attributable to the sale of a block of stock in X Corporation and a block of stock in Y Corporation. Assume further that $10,000 of the gain on the block of X stock was treated as a dividend and that $8,000 of the gain on the block of Y stock was treated as a dividend. Thus, the tax attributable to the amount treated as a dividend in respect of the block of X stock is $6,370 ($10,000/$18,000 of $11,466) and the amount in respect of the block of Y stock is $5,096 ($8,000/$18,000 of $11,466). The result would be the same if both blocks of stock were blocks of stock in the same corporation.
(c)
Excess (of United States taxes which would have been paid over taxes actually paid) attributable to a share (or block)
—(1)
General.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section:
(i) The term
taxes
means income, war profits, or excess profits taxes, and
(ii) The excess (and the portion of such excess attributable to an individual's share or block of stock in a foreign corporation) of the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by the corporation, for the period or periods the stock was held (or was considered to be held by reason of the application of section 1223) by the individual in taxable years of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, while the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, shall be computed in accordance with the steps set forth in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Step 1.
For each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, in respect of the individual's share (or block) of such stock (i) the taxable income of the corporation shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, and (ii) the excess (and the portion of such excess attributable to the stock of the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation on such taxable income over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by the corporation shall be computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Step 2.
If during such taxable year the corporation is a first tier corporation to which paragraph (f) of this section applies, (i) the excess (and the portion of such excess attributable to the individual's share, or block, of stock in the first tier corporation) of the United States taxes which would have been paid by any lower tier corporation over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by such lower tier corporation shall be computed under paragraph (f) of this section, and (ii) such portion shall be added to the portion of the excess attributable to the individual's share (or block) of such stock as determined in step 1 for such taxable year.
(4)
Step 3.
The excess, in respect of the individual's share (or block), of the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation over the taxes actually paid by the corporation shall be the sum of the portions computed for each such taxable year in the manner prescribed in steps 1 and 2.
(d)
Taxable income.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, taxable income shall be computed in respect of an individual's share (or block) in accordance with the following rules:
(1)
Application of principles of
§
1.952-2.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the principles of paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c) of § 1.952-2 (other than subparagraphs (2)(iii)(
b
), (2)(v), (5)(i), and (6) of such paragraph (c)) shall apply.
(2)
Effect of elections.
In respect of a taxable year of a foreign corporation, no effect shall be given to an election or an adoption of accounting method unless for such taxable year effect is given to such election or adoption of accounting method under paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1248-2 or paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1248-3, whichever is applicable.
(3) The deductions for certain dividends received provided in sections 243, 244, and 245 shall not be allowed.
(4)
Deduction for taxes.
In computing the amount of the deduction allowed under section 164, there shall be excluded income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid or accrued which are imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States.
(5)
Capital loss carryover.
In determining the amount of a net capital loss to be carried forward under section 1212 to the taxable year:
(i) No net capital loss shall be carried forward from a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963.
(ii) The portion of a net capital loss or a capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, which shall be taken into account shall be the amount of such loss or gain (as the case may be), multiplied by the percentage which (
a
) the number of days in such taxable year during which the individual held (or was considered to have held by reason of the application of section 1223) the share (or block) of stock sold or exchanged while the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, bears to (
b
) the total number of days in such taxable year.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is a foreign corporation which was created on January 1, 1963, and which uses the calendar year as its taxable year. X was a controlled foreign corporation on each day of the period March 15, 1963, through December 31, 1965, but was not a controlled foreign corporation on any day during the period January 1, 1963, through March 14, 1963. On December 31, 1965, Smith, a United States person, sells a share of X stock which he has owned continuously since January 1, 1963. A portion of the gain recognized on the sale is includible in Smith's gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a). X had a net capital loss (determined without regard to subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code) of $200 for 1963. Since, however, X was a controlled foreign corporation for only 292 days in 1963, for purposes of determining the net capital loss carryover to 1964 the portion of the net capital loss of $200 for 1963 which Smith takes into account under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is $160 (292/365 of $200), and, accordingly, the amount of the net capital loss carryover to 1964 is $160.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that X was not a controlled foreign corporation on any day of the period May 26, 1964, through June 30, 1965. Assume further that X had a net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) (determined without regard to subchapter N, chapter 1, of the Code) of $160 for 1964. In computing X's taxable income for 1964 under this paragraph, Smith applies the net capital loss carryover of $160 from 1963 to reduce the net capital gain of $160 for 1964 to zero. Since, however, X was a controlled foreign corporation for only 146 days in 1964, for purposes of computing the portion of the 1963 capital loss of $160 which is a net capital loss carryover to 1965, the portion of the 1964 capital gain which Smith takes into account under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is $63.83 (
146/366
of $160). Thus, the net capital loss carryover to 1965 is $96.17 ($160 minus $63.83).
(6)
Net operating loss deduction.
(i) The individual shall reduce the taxable income (computed under subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph) of the corporation for the taxable year by the amount of the net operating loss deduction of the corporation computed under section 172, as modified in the manner prescribed in this subparagraph.
(ii) The rules of subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph shall apply for purposes of determining the excess referred to in section 172(c) and the taxable income referred to in section 172(b)(2).
(iii) A net operating loss shall not be carried forward from, or carried back to, a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963.
(iv) The portion of a net operating loss incurred, or of taxable income earned, in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, which shall be taken into account under section 172(b)(2) shall be the amount of such loss or income (as the case may be), multiplied by the percentage which (
a
) the number of days in such taxable year during which the individual held (or was considered to have held by reason of the application of section 1223) the share (or block) of stock sold or exchanged while the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, bears to (
b
) the total number of days in such taxable year.
(v) For illustrations of the principles of this subparagraph, see the examples relating to net capital loss carryovers in subparagraph (5)(iii) of this paragraph.
(7)
Adjustment for amount previously included in gross income of United States shareholders.
In respect of the individual's share (or block) of stock sold or exchanged, the taxable income of the corporation for the taxable year (determined without regard to this subparagraph and subparagraph (8) of this paragraph) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the sum of the amounts included under section 951 in the gross income of United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) of the corporation for the taxable year.
(8)
Adjustment for distributions.
In respect of the individual's share (or block) of stock sold or exchanged, the taxable income of the corporation for the taxable year (determined without regard to this subparagraph) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the distributions (other than in redemption of stock under section 302(a) or 303) made by the corporation out of earnings and profits of such taxable year (within the meaning of section 316(a)(2)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, distributions shall be taken into account only to the extent not excluded from the gross income of the United States shareholders of the corporation under section 959.
(e)
Excess attributable to a share (or block) of stock
—(1)
Excess of United States taxes which would have been paid over taxes actually paid.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, in respect of a taxable year of a foreign corporation, the portion of the excess under this subparagraph which is attributable to an individual's share (or block) of such stock shall be an amount equal to:
(i) The excess (if any) of (
a
) the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation on its taxable income (computed under paragraph (d) of this section) for the taxable year had it been taxed as a domestic corporation under chapter 1 of the Code (but without regard to subchapters F, G, H, L, M, N, S, and T thereof) for such taxable year, over (
b
) the income, war profits, or excess profits taxes actually paid by the corporation during such taxable year (including such taxes paid to the United States),
(ii) Multiplied by the percentage that (
a
) the number of days in such taxable year of the corporation during the period or periods the share (or block) was held (or was considered as held by reason of the application of section 1223) by the individual while the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation, bears to (
b
) the total number of days in such taxable year,
(iii) If the computation is made in respect of a block, multiplied by the number of shares in the block, and
(iv) Divided by the number of shares in the corporation outstanding, or deemed under paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1248-3 to be outstanding, on each day of such taxable year.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(i) Jones, a United States person, owns on each day of 1963 10 shares of the 100 shares of the only class of outstanding stock of X corporation. He sells one of such shares on December 31, 1963. X corporation is a controlled foreign corporation on each day of 1963 and Jones and X each use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1963, the excess of the United States taxes which would have been paid by X had it been taxable as a domestic corporation over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by X is $23,500, computed as follows:
Amount subject to partial tax under section 1201(a)(1), as computed by Jones:

Since on each day of 1963, Jones held the share of X stock while X was a controlled foreign corporation, the percentage equals
100%
Total
$23,500
(ii) The portion of the excess determined in subdivision (i) of this example which is attributable to the share held by Jones is $235, that is, the amount of such excess ($23,500), divided by the number of shares of X deemed to be outstanding on each day of 1963 (100).

§ 1.1248-5
Stock ownership requirements for less developed country corporations.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Requirements.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.1248-3, a United States person shall be considered as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph with respect to a share (or block) of stock of a foreign corporation if on the date he sells or exchanges such share (or block):
(i) The 10-year stock ownership requirement of paragraph (b) of this section is met with respect to such share (or block), and
(ii) In the case of a United States person which is a domestic corporation, the requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, if applicable, is met.
(2)
Ownership of stock.
For purposes of this section:
(i) The rules for determining ownership of stock prescribed by section 958 (a) and (b) shall apply.
(ii) Stock owned by a United States person who is an individual, estate, or trust which was acquired by reason of the death of the predecessor in interest of such United States person shall be considered as owned by such United States persons during the period such stock was owned by such predecessor in interest, and during the period such stock was owned by any other predecessor in interest if between such United States person and such other predecessor in interest there was no transfer other than by reason of the death of an individual.
(b)
10-year stock ownership requirement
—(1)
General.
A United States person meets the 10-year stock ownership requirement with respect to a share (or block) of stock in a foreign corporation which he sells or exchanges only if the share (or block) was owned (under the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) by such person for a continuous period of at least 10 years ending on the date of the sale or exchange. See the first sentence of section 1248(d)(3). Thus, for example, if Jones, a United States person, sells a share of stock in a foreign corporation on January 1, 1965, the 10-year stock ownership requirement is met with respect to a share only if the share was owned (under the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) by Jones continuously from January 1, 1955, to January 1, 1965. If a foreign corporation has not been in existence for at least 10 years on the date of the sale or exchange of the share, the 10-year stock ownership requirement cannot be met.
(2)
Special rule.
For purposes of this paragraph, a United States person shall be considered to have owned stock during the period he was considered to have held the stock by reason of the application of section 1223.
(c)
Disqualification of domestic corporation as a result of changes in ownership of its stock
—(1)
General.
(i) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the requirement of this paragraph must be met only if, on at least one day during the 10-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange by a domestic corporation of a share of stock in a foreign corporation, one or more noncorporate United States shareholders (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) own more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the domestic corporation.
(ii) The requirement of this paragraph is that if one or more persons are noncorporate United States shareholders on the first such day (referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph), such person or persons continue
after such first day, at all times during the remainder of such 10-year period, to own in the aggregate more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the domestic corporation. For purposes of determining whether a domestic corporation meets the requirement of this paragraph, the stock owned by a United States person who is a noncorporate United States shareholder of a domestic corporation on such first day shall not be counted at any time after he ceases during such 10-year period to be a noncorporate United States shareholder of such corporation.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term
noncorporate United States shareholder
means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a United States person who is an individual, estate, or trust and who owns 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such domestic corporation.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the percentage of the total combined voting power of stock of a foreign corporation owned by a United States person shall be determined in accordance with the principles of section 951(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During the entire period beginning December 31, 1954, and ending December 31, 1964, domestic corporation N owns all the stock of controlled foreign corporation X, a less developed country corporation. On December 31, 1964, N recognizes gain upon the sale of all its X stock. A, B, and C, who are unrelated individuals, were the only United States persons owning, or considered as owning, 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of N at any time during the 10-year period December 31, 1954, through December 31, 1964. The percentages of the total combined voting power in N, which A, B, and C owned during such 10-year period, are as follows:
Owner
Dec. 31, 1954-
Apr. 1, 1957 (
Percent
)
Apr. 2, 1957-Oct. 1, 1959 (

Percent
)

B

C

Domestic corporation N does not meet the requirement of this paragraph with respect to the stock of controlled foreign corporation X for the following reasons:
(i) April 2, 1957, is the first day (during the 10-year period ending on December 31, 1964, the date N sells the X stock) on which noncorporate United States shareholders of N own more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power in N, and thus the requirement of this paragraph must be met. See subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph. Although A, B, and C did own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of such voting power before April 2, 1957, the voting power owned by B is not counted because B was not a noncorporate United States shareholder of N before such date.
(ii) Although C is a noncorporate United States shareholder on April 2, 1957, C ceases to own 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power in N on October 2, 1959. Thus, after October 1, 1959, the N stock which C owns is not counted for purposes of determining whether the more-than-50-percent stock ownership test is met. See subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. Accordingly, after October 1, 1959, the requirement of this paragraph is not met.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that B's wife owns directly 5 percent of the total combined voting power in N from December 31, 1954, to December 31, 1964. On the basis of the assumed facts, N meets the requirement of this paragraph with respect to the stock of controlled foreign corporation X for the following reasons:
(i) December 31, 1954, is the first day (of the 10-year period ending on the date N sells the X stock) on which noncorporate United States shareholders of N own more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power in N. B is a noncorporate United States shareholder on such date because he owns, and is considered as owning, 14 percent of the total combined voting power in N (9 percent directly, and, under section 958(b), 5 percent constructively). Thus, on December 31, 1954, noncorporate United States shareholders A, B, and C own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power in N.
(ii) A, B, and C, the noncorporate United States shareholders of N on December 31, 1954, own, and are considered as owning, more than 50 percent of the total voting power of N from December 31, 1954, to October 1, 1959. Since beginning on October 2, 1959, A owns 20 percent and B owns, and is considered as owning, 35 percent of the total combined voting power in N, A and B owns, and are considered as owning, more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power in N from October 2, 1959, to December 31, 1964. Therefore, the requirement of this paragraph is met.
(d)
Application of section to lower tier corporation
—(1)
General.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of § 1.1248-3, a United States person satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph in respect of stock of a lower tier corporation which such person, by reason of his direct ownership of the share (or block) of the first tier corporation sold or exchanged, owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) on the date he sold or exchanged such share (or block), if on such date:
(i) The 10-year stock ownership requirement of paragraph (b) of this section is met by such person with respect to any stock in the lower tier corporation which such person so owned, and
(ii) In the case of a United States person which is a domestic corporation, the requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, if applicable, is met.
(2)
Special rule.
For purposes of this paragraph, in applying paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the sale or exchange of a share (or block) of stock in a first tier corporation by a United States person shall be deemed to be the sale or exchange of any stock in a lower tier corporation which the person, by reason of his direct ownership of such share (or block) of the first tier corporation, owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) on the date he actually sold or exchanged such share (or block) in the first tier corporation.

§ 1.1248-6
Sale or exchange of stock in certain domestic corporations.
(a)
General rule.
If a United States person recognizes gain upon the sale or exchange of a share (or block) of stock of a domestic corporation which was formed or availed of principally for the holding, directly or indirectly, of stock of one or more foreign corporations, and if the conditions of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1248-1 would be met by such person in respect of the share (or block) if the domestic corporation were a foreign corporation, then section 1248 shall apply in respect of such gain in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for a rule suspending the application of this section in certain circumstances.
(b)
Application.
(1) The gain referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be included in the gross income of the United States person as a dividend under section 1248(a) to the extent of the earnings and profits attributable under § 1.1248-2 or § 1.1248-3, whichever is applicable, to the share (or block), computed, however, in accordance with the following rules:
(i) The domestic corporation shall be treated as if it were a first tier foreign corporation;
(ii) If, after the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1248-2 or paragraph (f) of § 1.1248-3 (as the case may be) would apply in respect of a foreign corporation the stock of which is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by the domestic corporation treated as the first tier corporation, such foreign corporation shall be considered a lower tier corporation;
(iii) Except to the extent provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, the earnings and profits of the domestic corporation treated as the first tier corporation accumulated for a taxable year, as computed under paragraph (d) of § 1.1248-2 or paragraph (b) of § 1.1248-3 (as the case may be), shall be considered to be zero; and
(iv) If, during a taxable year, a domestic corporation treated as the first tier corporation realizes gain upon the sale or exchange of stock in a foreign corporation, and solely by reason of the application of section 337 (relating to certain liquidations) the gain was not recognized, then the earnings and profits of such domestic corporation accumulated for the taxable year, as computed under paragraph (d) of § 1.1248-2 or paragraph (b) of § 1.1248-3 (as the case may be), shall be considered to be an amount equal to the portion of such gain realized during the taxable year which, if section 337 had not applied, would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248(a).
(2) If the person selling or exchanging the stock in the domestic corporation is an individual, the limitation on tax attributable to the amount included in his gross income as a dividend under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be determined, in accordance
with the principles of paragraph (f) of § 1.1248-4, by treating the domestic corporation as a first tier corporation.
(3)(i) If the earnings and profits of the foreign corporation or corporations (or of the domestic corporation treated as a first tier corporation) to be taken into account under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are not established in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1248-7, all of the gain from the sale or exchange of the share (or block) of the domestic corporation shall be treated as a dividend.
(ii) To the extent that the person does not establish, in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of § 1.1248-7, the foreign taxes paid by such foreign corporation or corporations to be taken into account for purposes of computing the limitation on tax attributable to a share, such foreign taxes shall not be taken into account for purposes of such computation.
(c)
Corporation formed or availed of principally for holding stock of foreign corporations.
Whether or not a domestic corporation is formed or availed of principally for the holding, directly or indirectly, of stock of one or more foreign corporations shall be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
(d)
Temporary suspension of section 1248(e).
Section 1248(e) and the rules of this section do not apply to a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the stock of a domestic corporation during a period when capital gains are taxed at a rate that equals or exceeds the rate at which ordinary income is taxed.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (d) of this section applies to a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the stock of a domestic corporation on or after September 21, 1987.

schedule or schedules. If any such estimate differs from the actual amount or percentage, the taxpayer shall, within 90 days after the close of any such taxable year of any such corporation, file (or attach to a claim for refund or amended return filed) at the office of the district director with whom he filed the return a new schedule or schedules showing the actual amounts or percentages.

# Example 1. A section 351 exchange of property other than stock in a foreign corporation with respect to which the exchanging shareholder is either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder.
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 3. On December 31, year 5, DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, contributes property it has held since January 1, year 1, to CFC in exchange for voting stock of CFC in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange under section 351. The property that DC2 contributes is not stock in a foreign corporation with respect to which DC2 was either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder. DC2 receives 80% of the voting stock of CFC in the restructuring transaction and its holding period in that CFC stock, determined pursuant to section 1223(1), began on January 1, year 1. CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits on December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock.
(ii)
Result.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $80. This amount consists of none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.

# Example 2. A section 351 exchange of controlled foreign corporation stock by a United States person for stock in a controlled foreign corporation in a restructuring transaction.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except as follows. The property that DC2 contributes is 100% of the stock in CFC2, a foreign corporation. DC2 has owned all the stock of CFC2 since CFC2's formation on January 1, year 2, and CFC2 has $200 of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 5. CFC2 does not accumulate any additional earnings and profits from December 31, year 5, to December 31, year 7. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock. Also on that date, DC1 sells its CFC stock.
(ii)
Result.
(A)
DC2 sale.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $280. This amount consists of all of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see also section 1248(c)(2)), none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.
(B)
DC1 sale.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC1, a non-exchanging shareholder in the restructuring transaction, are $120. This amount consists of all of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated before the restructuring transaction, none of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction, and 20% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.

# Example 3. A section 351 exchange of controlled foreign corporation stock by a United States person for stock in a domestic corporation in a restructuring transaction.
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 1. DC1 has also owned all the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since DC2's formation on
January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, DC1 contributes the stock of CFC to DC2 in exchange for stock in DC2 in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange described in section 351. On December 31, year 2, CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits. DC2 has a basis in the CFC stock determined under section 362, and is considered to have held the CFC stock since January 1, year 1, pursuant to section 1223(2). On December 31, year 4, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are still $100, DC2 sells its CFC stock.
(ii)
Result.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, $100 of accumulated earnings and profits of CFC is attributable to the stock of CFC sold by DC2, even though DC2 did not hold the stock of CFC during the time CFC accumulated the earnings and profits.

# Example 4. Acquisition of a controlled foreign corporation by a controlled foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) (or section 368(a)(1)(B)).
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2. CFC1 distributes the CFC2 stock to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. DC1's holding period in the CFC2 stock, determined under section 1223(1), begins on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits. CFC2 succeeds to the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits in the reorganization under section 381. From January 1, year 4 to December 31, year 5, CFC2 incurred a deficit in earnings and profits in the amount of ($200). On December 31, year 5, both DC1 and DC2 sell their stock in CFC2.
(ii)
Result.
(A)
DC1.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, $50 of earnings and profits is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. This amount consists of $100 of CFC1's earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction, reduced by 25% of CFC2's ($200) post-restructuring transaction deficit in earnings and profits. None of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. Also, none of the earnings and profits CFC2 succeeded to under section 381 is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(B)
DC2.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, there is $50 of accumulated earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2.

None of the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits succeeded to under section 381 is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(C)
Section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization.
If, instead of DC1 acquiring its 25% interest in CFC2 pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC1 had transferred the stock of CFC1 to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2 in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), the results would be the same as described in paragraphs (ii) (A) and (B) of this
Example 4.

# Example 5. Acquisition of the stock of a foreign corporation that controls a domestic acquiring corporation in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)

DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to DC2 in exchange for 60% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), DC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits, CFC2 has $300 of earnings and profits, and FC has $200 of earnings and profits. DC1 includes the $100 all earnings and profits amount attributable to its CFC1 stock in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-3 upon the exchange of CFC1 stock for FC stock. Pursuant to the lower-tier earnings exclusion of § 1.367(b)-2(d)(3)(ii), that amount does not include the $300 of earnings and profits of CFC2. From January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5, FC (now a controlled foreign corporation) accumulates an additional $50 of earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4 until December 31, year 5, CFC2 accumulates an additional $100 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 5, DC1 sells its stock in FC and DC2 sells its stock in CFC2.

Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 and DC2, and the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1, will be reduced (regardless of whether CFC2 recognizes gain on its sale of CFC3 stock).
(

)
CFC1.
The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 will be reduced by $32, or the amount of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 5, that would have been attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This amount consists of all of the $20 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 before the restructuring transaction and 40% of the $30 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 after the restructuring transaction (.40 × $30 = $12).
(

)
DC1.
The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1 will also be reduced by $32, or the amount of earnings and profits that would have been attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1 as of December 31, year 5.
(

)
DC2.
The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by DC2 will be reduced by $18, or the amount of earnings and profits that would have been attributable to the CFC2 stock held by DC2 as of December 31, year 5, under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. This amount consists of 60% of the $30 (.60 × $30 = $18) of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 after the restructuring transaction.
(C)
Partial sale by CFC2.
If, instead of selling 100% of the CFC3 stock, on December 31, year 5, CFC2 sells only 50% of its CFC3 stock, paragraph (b)(5) of this section requires CFC1 to reduce the earnings and profits of CFC3 attributable to its CFC2 stock to $16. Similarly, DC1 would be required to reduce the earnings and profits of CFC3 attributable to its CFC1 stock by $16. Paragraph (b)(5) of this section also requires DC2 to reduce the CFC3 earnings and profits attributable to its CFC2 stock by $9. These reductions occur without regard to whether CFC2 recognizes gain on its sale of CFC3 stock.

# Example 8. Acquisition of the assets of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation by an upper-tier controlled foreign corporation in a restructuring transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 is a holding company that has owned 79% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. The other 21% of CFC2 stock is owned by X, an unrelated party. On December 31, year 1, CFC2 has $200 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, CFC1 has no accumulated earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, pursuant to a restructuring transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC2 transfers all its properties to CFC1. In exchange, CFC1 assumes the liabilities of CFC2 and transfers to CFC2 voting stock representing 21% of the stock of CFC1. CFC2 distributes the voting stock to X and liquidates. The liabilities assumed do not exceed 20% of the value of the properties of CFC2. From January 1, year 2, to December 31, year 3, CFC1 accumulates $100 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 3, DC sells its CFC1 stock.
(ii)
Result.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, there is $237 of earnings and profits attributable to DC's CFC1 stock. This amount consists of 79% of CFC2's $200 of earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see section 1248(c)(2)), and 79% of CFC1's $100 of earnings and profits accumulated after the restructuring transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, none of CFC2's $200 of earnings and profits to which CFC1 succeeded under section 381 would be attributable to DC's CFC1 stock.
(c)
Earnings and profits attributable to stock of a foreign distributee corporation that is a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to a foreign liquidating corporation
—(1)
General rule.
If a foreign corporation (liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (distributee), and immediately before the liquidation the distributee was a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to the liquidating foreign corporation, the amount of earnings and profits attributable to the distributee stock upon its subsequent sale or exchange will be determined under this paragraph (c)(1). The earnings and profits attributable will be the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee immediately before the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)) and the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee accumulated after the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)).
(2)
Special rule regarding section 381.
Solely for purposes of determining the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) attributable to stock under this paragraph (c), the attributed earnings and profits of a corporation shall not include earnings and profits that are treated as received or incurred pursuant to section 381(c)(2)(A) and § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a).
(3)
Example—
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 is an operating company that has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, CFC1 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has a ($200) deficit in earnings and profits. On December 31, year 2, CFC2 distributes all of its assets and liabilities to CFC1 in a liquidation to which section 332 applies. From January 1, year 3, until December 31, year 4, CFC1 accumulates no additional earnings and profits. On December 31, year 4, DC sells its stock in CFC1.
(ii)
Result.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, there are no earnings and profits attributable to DC's CFC1 stock. This amount consists of the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock immediately before the liquidation (100% of the $200 accumulated earnings and profits of CFC1 and 100% of CFC2's ($200) deficit in earnings and profits) and the amount of earnings and profits
accumulated after the section 332 liquidation (see also section 1248(c)(2)).

(B) Provide the name and taxpayer identification number (if any) of the domestic distributing corporation, the foreign distributed corporation, and each section 1248 shareholder;
(C) With respect to each section 1248 shareholder, describe the extent to which the shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation are divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(D) With respect to each section 1248 shareholder, state the amount of earnings and profits attributable to the stock (or each block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is attributable under § 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv) to the stock of the foreign distributed corporation received in the new stock distribution;
(E) With respect to each section 1248 shareholder, state the amount of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock (or each block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is attributable under § 1.1248(f)-
2(d) to the stock of the foreign distributed corporation received in the new stock distribution;
(F) With respect to each section 1248 shareholder, state the amount of the adjustment to the section 358 basis of the stock of the foreign distributed corporation under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(G) With respect to each section 1248 shareholder, state the amount the domestic distributing corporation must include in gross income as a dividend under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Portions.
If the domestic distributing corporation transfers property, other than a single block of stock of a foreign corporation with respect to which the domestic distributing corporation is a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the section 361 exchange, to the foreign distributed corporation in the section 361 exchange that precedes the new stock distribution, then each share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation received by a distributee that is a section 1248 shareholder must be divided into portions as follows:
(i) One portion attributable to all property transferred in the section 361 exchange, other than property that is stock of a foreign corporation with respect to which the domestic distributing corporation is a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the section 361 exchange; and
(ii) One portion attributable to each block of stock of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange with respect to which the domestic distributing corporation is a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the section 361 exchange. For the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock (or block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that are attributable to a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation, see § 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv). For the determination of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock (or block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is attributable to a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(3)
Basis adjustments and income inclusions.
If the section 1248(f) amount attributable to a portion of a share of stock (or whole share, if no division is required) (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of the foreign distributed corporation received by a distributee that is a section 1248 shareholder in the new stock distribution exceeds the section 1248 shareholder's postdistribution amount in the portion (or whole share, if no division is required) (excess amount), then the section 1248 shareholder's section 358 basis in the portion as determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section (or whole share, if no division is required), as adjusted under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), is reduced by the excess amount, but not below zero. To the extent the excess amount exceeds the section 358 basis in the portion (or whole share, if no division is required), the domestic distributing corporation must include that portion of the section 1248(f) amount attributable to the portion of the share (or whole share, if no division is required) in gross income as a dividend. For an illustration of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section,
Example 2,
and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8),
Example 3.
(4)
Divided shares of stock
—(i)
Basis.
The basis of a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation created under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the product of the section 1248 shareholder's section 358 basis, as adjusted under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), in the share of stock multiplied by the ratio of the basis determined under section 362 (taking into account any gain or deemed dividends recognized under section 367) of the property (section 362 basis) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate section 362 basis of all property received by the foreign distributed corporation in the section 361 exchange. For illustrations of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section,
Example 2,
and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8),
Example 3.
(ii)
Fair market value.
The fair market value of a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation created under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the product of the fair market value of the share of stock multiplied
by the ratio of the fair market value of the property to which the portion relates to the aggregate fair market value of all property received by the foreign distributed corporation in the section 361 exchange. For illustrations of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section,
Example 2,
and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8),
Example 3.
(iii)
Subsequent exchanges.
For purposes of determining the gain realized on the sale or exchange of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation that has divided portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the share will be allocated to each divided portion based on the relative fair market value of the property to which the portion relates as determined at the time of the reorganization.
(iv)
Duration of divided shares.
Shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation that are divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be divided so long as section 1248(a) would apply to a sale or exchange of the shares.
(d)
Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount to certain stock of the foreign distributed corporation.
This paragraph (d) applies if there is a new stock distribution for which an election under § 1.1248(f)-2(c)(1) is made. This paragraph (d) provides rules for attributing all or a portion, as applicable, of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange by the domestic distributing corporation to shares of stock, or to portions of shares of stock, as applicable, received in the foreign distributed corporation and distributed to one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders with respect to the foreign distributed corporation. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section provides rules to attribute the applicable section 1248(f) amount among shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation received by one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders. If shares of stock are divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(2) of this section provides additional rules to attribute the applicable section 1248 amount to portions of shares of stock received by one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders.
(1)
Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount among shares of stock.
With respect to one or more shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation distributed to a distributee that is a section 1248 shareholder, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of the foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is equal to the distributee's hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed among those shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation based on the ratio of the value of a share distributed to the distributee to the value of all shares of stock distributed to the distributee (attributable share amount).
(2)
Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount to portions of a share of stock
—(i)
Single block of stock.
If a single block of stock of the foreign corporation is transferred in the section 361 exchange, the attributable share amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is attributed to the portion of the share that relates to the single block of stock of the foreign corporation.
(ii)
Multiple blocks of stock.
If multiple blocks of stock of the foreign corporation are transferred in the section 361 exchange, the attributable share amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of the section) is attributed among the portions of the share that relate to such multiple blocks of stock of the foreign corporation. The portion of the attributable share amount that is attributable to a portion to which a block of stock relates is that amount that bears the same ratio that the section 1248(f) block amount with respect to that block of stock bears to the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of the foreign corporation.
(e)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. See also § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8),
Example 3.
For purposes of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: DP and DC are domestic corporations; X is a United
States citizen; FP is a foreign corporation; CFC1, CFC2, and FA are controlled foreign corporations; each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; each shareholder of a corporation owns a single block of stock in the corporation; DC owns Business A, which consists solely of property whose fair market value exceeds its basis and could satisfy the requirements of the active foreign trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) and § 1.367(a)-2; DC owns no other assets and has no liabilities; the requirements in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) are satisfied; no earnings and profits of a foreign corporation are described in section 1248(d); and none of the foreign corporations in the examples is a surrogate foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 7874) as a result of the transactions described in the examples because one or more of the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) is not satisfied.

# Example 1. Existing stock distribution under section 355(c)(1); gain recognition and adjustment to stock basis.
(i)
Facts.
DP, FP, and X own 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DP's DC stock has a $140x basis, $160x fair market value, and a 2-year holding period. DC wholly owns CFC1. DC's CFC1 stock has a $50x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a gain of $50x), $25x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a $25x section 1248 amount (computed as the lesser of $50x gain in the CFC1 stock and $25x of section 1248 earnings and profits), and a 3-year holding period. On December 31, year 3, DC distributes all of the CFC1 stock to DP, FP, and X on a pro-rata basis in a distribution to which section 355 applies. The fair market value of the CFC1 stock received by DP, FP, and X is $80x, $10x, and $10x, respectively. After the distribution, DP's stock in DC has a fair market value of $80x and DP's section 358 basis in the CFC1 stock is $70x (a pro rata portion, or 50%, of DP's $140x basis in the DC stock immediately before the distribution). See § 1.358-2(a)(iv).
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under § 1.367(e)-1(b)(1), DC must recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to FP (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Under § 1.367(b)-5(b)(1)(ii), DC must also recognize $5x gain on the distribution of CFC1 stock to X (10% of the $50x gain in the CFC1 stock). Of the aggregate $10x gain recognized by DC, $5x is recharacterized as a dividend under section 1248(a), computed as 20% of the $25x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock. See § 1.1248-1 for additional consequences.
(B) DC's distribution of CFC1 stock to DP is described in section 1248(f)(1) and § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) because the distribution is pursuant to section 355(c)(1) (an existing stock distribution). As a result, the general rule is that DC must include in gross income as a dividend the section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock distributed to DP, or $20x (computed as 80% of the $25x section 1248 amount). However, if DP and DC make the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) will not apply to DC's distribution of CFC1 stock to DP. If DP and DC make the election, then:
(
1
) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of section 1248, immediately after the distribution DP will have a 3-year holding period in the CFC1 stock, the same holding period DC had in the CFC1 stock at the time of the distribution.
(
2
) Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the CFC1 stock ($70x) is reduced by $10x, the amount by which DC's section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($20x) distributed to DP exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($10x). Under § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6), DP's postdistribution amount equals the amount that DP would include in gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) if DP sold the CFC1 stock immediately after the distribution, or $10x, which is computed as the lesser of the $10x gain in the CFC1 stock ($80x fair market value, less $70x basis) and $20x of section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock, taking into account DP's 3-year holding period in the stock as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As adjusted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's basis in the CFC1 stock is $60x ($70x basis, less $10x required basis reduction).

# Example 2. New stock distribution under section 361(c)(1); adjustment to stock basis.
(i)
Facts.
DP wholly owns DC. DP's DC stock has a $180x basis and $200x fair market value. DC wholly owns CFC1 and CFC2. DC's CFC1 stock has a $70x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a gain of $30x), $40x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a section 1248 amount of $30x (computed as the lesser of the $30x gain in CFC1 stock and $40x section 1248 earnings and profits). DC's CFC2 stock has a $130x basis, $100x fair market value (therefore a loss of $30x), $80x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a section 1248 amount of $0x (computed as the lesser of the $0x gain and $80x section 1248 earnings and profits). On December 31, Year 1, in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F), DC transfers the CFC1 stock and the CFC2 stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 100 shares of FA stock. DC distributes the 100
shares of FA stock to DP. DC's transfer of the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock to FA in exchange for FA stock qualifies as a section 361 exchange, and DC's distribution of the 100 shares of FA stock to DP is pursuant to section 361(c)(1). DP exchanges its DC stock for the 100 shares of FA stock pursuant to section 354. Immediately after the transaction, DP wholly owns FA. DP and DC elect to apply the provisions of § 1.367(a)-7(c) in accordance with § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5). Pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A), DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC1 stock that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8.
(ii)
Result.
(A) DC does not recognize gain under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(2) with respect to the transfer of the CFC1 stock to FA because the three conditions in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(i), (e)(3)(ii), and (e)(3)(iii) are satisfied. First, § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(i) is satisfied because the requirements of § 1.367(a)-7(c) are satisfied, including that an election is made to apply § 1.367(a)-7(c). Second, the requirements under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(ii) related to transfers of domestic stock are not applicable because CFC1 is a foreign corporation. Third, because DC owns all the stock of FA immediately after DC's receipt of the FA stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the FA stock to DP, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii), DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC1 stock that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8. Furthermore, DC is not required to recognize gain under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii), and DP is not required to reduce its $180x section 358 basis in the FA stock under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), because the inside gain (within the meaning of § 1.367(a)-7(f)(5)) is $0x ($200x aggregate fair market value of CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock, less $200x aggregate basis of CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock). In addition, DC is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the $30x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC1 stock under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) because immediately after DC's receipt of the FA stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the FA stock to DP, CFC1 and FA are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder. See § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A). With respect to the transfer of the CFC2 stock to FA, DC's section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is $0x; therefore, § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) has no application.
(B) Under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3), as a result of the section 361(c)(1) distribution of the FA stock to DP (a new stock distribution), the general rule is that DC must include in gross income as a dividend the total section 1248(f) amount (defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(14)). The total section 1248(f) amount is $30x, the sum of the section 1248(f) amount (defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(10)) with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x) and CFC2 stock ($0x). The section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is the amount that DC would have included in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC1 stock if the requirements under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($30x), less the amount of gain recognized by DC under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) that is allocable to the CFC1 stock under § 1.367(a)-7(e)(1) and treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) ($0x). Similarly, the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is the amount that DC would have included in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC2 stock if the requirements under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($0x), less the amount of gain recognized by DC under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) that is allocable to the CFC2 stock under § 1.367(a)-7(e)(1) and treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) ($0x).
(C) If, however, DP and DC make the election provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount that DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) (the total section 1248(f) amount of $30x) is reduced to the extent the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x) and CFC2 stock ($0x) is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the shares of FA stock distributed to one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders of FA. The only distributee is DP, and DP is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FA. If DP and DC elect to apply paragraph (c) of this section, then:
(
1
) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock that is attributed to the shares of FA stock distributed to DP is equal to DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount (as defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(4)) with respect to the CFC1 stock. Because DP is the only shareholder of DC, DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount equals the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock ($30x). The $30x hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed pro rata (based on relative values) among the 100 shares of FA stock distributed to DP, and the attributable share amount (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is $.30x. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section has no application with respect to the CFC2 stock because there is no section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock.
(
2
) If the shares of FA stock are divided into portions, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to attribute the attributable share amount ($.30x) to portions of shares of FA stock distributed to DP. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the 100 shares of FA stock are divided into two portions, one portion related to the single block
of CFC1 stock and one portion related to the single block of CFC2 stock. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the attributable share amount of $.30x is attributed to the portion of the 100 shares of FA stock that relates to the single block of CFC1 stock. Thus, all of the $30x section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock is attributable to the 100 shares of FA stock.
(
3
) Because the election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is made, the total section 1248(f) amount ($30x) that DC is otherwise required to include in gross income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is reduced by $30x, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC1 stock that is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the shares of FA stock distributed to DP. Thus, the amount DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is $0x ($30x less $30x).
(
4
) Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the basis of each portion is the product of DP's section 358 basis in the share of FA stock multiplied by the ratio of the section 362 basis of the property (CFC1 stock or CFC2 stock, as applicable) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate section 362 basis of all property (CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock) received by FA in the section 361 exchange. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fair market value of each portion is the product of the fair market value of the share of FA stock multiplied by the ratio of the fair market value of the property (CFC1 stock or CFC2 stock, as applicable) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate fair market value of all property (CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock) received by FA in the section 361 exchange. The section 362 basis of the CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock is $70x and $130x, respectively, for a total section 362 basis of $200x. The CFC1 stock and CFC2 stock each has a fair market value of $100x, for a total fair market value of $200x. Therefore, the portions attributable to the CFC1 stock have an aggregate basis of $63x ($180x multiplied by $70x/$200x) and fair market value of $100x ($200x multiplied by $100x/$200x), resulting in aggregate gain in such portions of $37x (or $.37x per portion in each of the 100 shares). The portions attributable to the CFC2 stock have an aggregate basis of $117x ($180x multiplied by $130x/$200x) and fair market value of $100x ($200x multiplied by $100x/$200x), resulting in aggregate losses in such portions of $17x (or $.17x per portion in each of the 100 shares).
(
5
) Under § 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv), the $40x earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC1 stock are attributed to the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock that relate to the CFC1 stock. Similarly, the $80x of earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC2 stock are attributed to the portions of the 100 shares of the FA stock that relate to the CFC2 stock. Thus, DP's postdistribution amount (defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6)) with respect to the portions of the shares of FA attributable to the CFC1 stock is $37x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the portions attributable to the CFC1 stock of $37x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
4
) of this
Example 2
) and the $40x earnings and profits attributable to such portions. Furthermore, DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the portions of the shares of FA attributable to the CFC2 stock is $0x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the portions attributable to the CFC2 stock of $0x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
4
) of this
Example 2
to be an aggregate loss of $17x) and the $80x earnings and profits attributable to such portions.
(
6
) Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC1 stock ($63x, computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
4
) of this
Example 2
) is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such portions under paragraph (d) of this section ($30x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
2
) of this
Example 2
) exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such portions ($37x, computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
5
) of this
Example 2
). Thus, there is no basis reduction in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC1 stock. DP's section 358 basis in the portions of the 100 shares of FA stock attributable to the CFC2 stock is not reduced because the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such portions under paragraph (d) of this section is $0x (computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
2
) of this
Example 2
), which equals DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such portions of $0x (as computed in paragraph (ii)(C)(
5
) of this
Example 2
).

# Example 3. Combined existing stock distribution and new stock distribution under sections 355(c)(1) and 361(c)(1).
(i)
Facts.
DP owns all 100 outstanding shares of stock of DC. DP's DC stock has a $180x basis (each of the 100 shares having a basis of $18), $200x fair market value, and 2-year holding period. DC owns all 60 shares of the outstanding stock of CFC1; all such shares constitute a single block of stock. DC's CFC1 stock has a $50x basis, $60x fair market value, $30x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, a $10x section 1248 amount (computed as the lesser of $10x gain and $30x of section 1248 earnings and profits), and a 3-year holding period. DC also owns all 40 shares of the outstanding stock of CFC2; all such shares constitute a single block of stock. DC's CFC2 stock has a $30x basis, $40x fair market value, $20x of earnings and profits attributable to it for purposes of section 1248, and a $10x section 1248 amount (computed as the lesser of $10x gain and $20x of section 1248 earnings and profits). DC also owns Business A, which has a fair market value of $100x. On December 31, year 4, in a
divisive reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC transfers the CFC2 stock to CFC1 in exchange for 40 shares of newly issued CFC1 stock. DC's transfer of the CFC2 stock to CFC1 qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DC then distributes the 100 shares of CFC1 stock (60 shares held prior to the transaction and 40 shares received in the section 361 exchange) to DP in a transaction that qualifies under section 355. DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC2 stock that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8. DP and DC properly make the elections provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(ii)
Result.
(A) DC does not recognize gain under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(2) with respect to the transfer of the CFC2 stock to CFC1 because the three conditions in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(i), (e)(3)(ii), and (e)(3)(iii) are satisfied. First, § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(i) is satisfied because the requirements of § 1.367(a)-7(c) are satisfied, including that an election is made to apply § 1.367(a)-7(c). Second, the requirements under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(ii) related to transfers of domestic stock are not applicable because CFC2 is a foreign corporation. Third, because DC and DP own all the stock of CFC1 for purposes of satisfying the requirements of § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii), DP properly files a gain recognition agreement with respect to the CFC2 stock that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8. See paragraph (ii)(G) of this example for the computation of the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement. In addition, DC is not required to include in income as a dividend the $10x section 1248 amount with respect to the CFC2 stock under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) because immediately after DC's receipt of the CFC1 stock in the section 361 exchange but prior to, and without taking into account, DC's distribution of the CFC1 stock to DP, CFC1 and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder. See § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A).
(B) DC is not required to recognize gain under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i) because DP, a control group member (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)(1)), owns 100% of DC. DC is not required to recognize gain under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii) because the amount described in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A) ($10x) does not exceed the amount described in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(B) ($40x). The $10x described in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A) equals the product of the inside gain (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)) ($10x) multiplied by DP's ownership interest percentage (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)) (100%), reduced by the sum of the amounts in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) ($0x). Under § 1.367(a)-7(f)(5), the $10x of inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value of the section 367(a) property (CFC2 stock with a fair market value of $40x) exceeds the sum of the inside basis ($30x) of such property, and $0x (the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by DC's deductible liabilities assumed by CFC1 ($0x)). Under § 1.367(a)-7(f)(4), the $30x inside basis equals the aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange ($30x), increased by any gain or deemed dividends recognized by DC with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367 ($0x). The $40x described in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(B) is the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the fair market value of the 40 shares of CFC1 stock received by DC in the section 361 exchange and distributed to DP ($40x).
(C) Under section 358, DP must allocate the $180x basis in its 100 shares of DC stock between the 100 shares of DC stock (fair market value of $100x) and the 100 shares of CFC1 stock (fair market value of $100x) held after the distribution based on the relative fair market values of the shares. Accordingly, after the allocation of the basis under section 358, but prior to the application of § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), the basis of DP's DC stock is $90x and the basis of DP's CFC1 stock is $90x. With respect to the $90x basis in the 100 shares of CFC1 stock, $36x is attributable to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock received by DC in the section 361 exchange ($90x multiplied by 40/100), and $54x is attributable to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock owned by DC prior to the section 361 exchange ($90x multiplied by 60/100). See § 1.358-2(a)(2)(iv).
(D) Pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3)(ii), any adjustment to DP's basis in the CFC1 stock required under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3)(i) can only be made with respect to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock received by DC in the section 361 exchange. Under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3)(i)(A), DP must reduce its section 358 basis ($36x) in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock by $6x, the amount by which DP's attributable inside gain ($10x), reduced by the sum of the amounts in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
3
) ($0x) (as computed in paragraph (ii)(B) of this
Example 3
) exceeds DP's outside gain (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)) ($4x). DP's $4x outside gain equals the product of the section 367(a) percentage (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)) (100%) multiplied by the amount by which the fair market value ($40x) of the 40 shares of CFC1 stock is greater than DP's section 358 basis in the stock ($36x). After the $6x reduction to stock basis required under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), but before the application of § 1.1248(f)-2(c)(3), DP's basis in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock is $30x.
(E) DC's distribution of the 40 shares of newly issued CFC1 stock is subject to § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) (a new stock distribution). Except as provided in § 1.1248(f)-2(c), under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) DC must include in gross income as a dividend the total section 1248(f) amount (as defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(14)). The total section 1248(f) amount is $10x, the sum
of the section 1248(f) amount (as defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(10)) with respect to the stock of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange. Only the CFC2 stock is transferred in the section 361 exchange; therefore, the total section 1248(f) amount is equal to the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock ($10x). The $10x section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock is the amount that DC would have included in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) with respect to the CFC2 stock if the requirements of § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(ii)(A) had not been satisfied ($10x), reduced by the amount of gain recognized by DC under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2) allocable to the CFC2 stock and treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) (in this case, $0x, as described in paragraph (ii)(B) of this
Example 3
).
(F) However, because DC and DP (a section 1248 shareholder of CFC1 immediately after the distribution) elect to apply the provisions of § 1.1248(f)-2(c) (as provided in § 1.1248(f)-2(c)(1)), the amount that DC is required to include in income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) ($10x total section 1248(f) amount as computed in paragraph (ii)(E) of this
Example 3
) is reduced by the sum of the portions of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock that is attributable (under the rules of § 1.1248(f)-2(d)) to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP. As stated in the facts, the election is made to apply § 1.1248(f)-2(c).
(
1
) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock that is attributed to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP is equal to DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount (as defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(4)) with respect to the CFC2 stock. Because DP is the only shareholder of DC, DP's hypothetical section 1248 amount equals the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock ($10x). The $10x hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed pro rata (based on relative values) among the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP, and the attributable share amount (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is $.25x.
(
2
) The 40 shares of CFC1 stock are not divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because the only property transferred by DC to CFC1 is a single block of stock of CFC2. If the 40 shares of CFC1 stock were required to be divided into portions, however, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to attribute the attributable share amount ($.25x) to portions of shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP.
(
3
) Because the election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is made, the total section 1248(f) amount ($10x) that DC is otherwise required to include in gross income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is reduced by $10x, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the CFC2 stock that is attributable under paragraph (d) of this section to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock distributed to DP. Thus, the amount DC is required to include in gross income as a dividend under § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) is $0x ($30x less $30x).
(
4
) Under § 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv), the $20x earnings and profits attributable to the single block of CFC2 stock are attributed pro rata to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock. Thus, DP's postdistribution amount (defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6)) with respect to the 40 shares of CFC1 stock attributable to the CFC2 stock is $10x, the lesser of the aggregate gain in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock of $10x ($40x fair market value, less $30x section 358 basis, as described in paragraph (ii)(D) of this
Example 3
) and the $20x earnings and profits attributable to such shares.
(
5
) Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock ($30x) is reduced by the amount (if any) by which the section 1248(f) amount attributable to such shares under paragraph (d) of this section ($10x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(E) of this
Example 3
) exceeds DP's postdistribution amount with respect to such shares ($10x). Thus, there is no basis reduction in the 40 shares of CFC1 stock.
(G) Pursuant § 1.367(a)-3(e)(6), the amount of gain subject to the gain recognition agreement entered into by DP with respect to the CFC2 stock is $10x, which is the product of DP's ownership interest percentage (100%) multiplied by the gain realized by DC in the 361 exchange prior to taking into account the application of any other provision of section 367 ($10x), reduced by the sum of the amounts described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(6)(i)(A), (e)(6)(i)(B), (e)(6)(i)(C), and (e)(6)(i)(D) ($0x).
(H) DC's distribution of the 60 shares of CFC1 stock it held before the section 361 exchange is subject to § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) (an existing stock distribution); however, because DC and DP make the election provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) does not apply to the distribution.
(
1
) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of section 1248, DP will have a 3-year holding period in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock received, the same holding period that DC had in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock.
(
2
) Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's section 358 basis in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock received ($54x, as computed in paragraph (ii)(C) of this
Example 3
) is reduced by $4x, the amount by which DC's section 1248 amount ($10x) with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock exceeds DP's postdistribution amount ($6x) with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock. Under § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(6), DP's postdistribution amount with respect to the 60 shares of CFC1 stock equals the amount that DP would include in gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) if DP sold the 60 shares of
CFC1 stock immediately after the distribution, or $6x, which is computed as the lesser of the $6x gain in the such shares of CFC1 stock ($60x fair market value, less $54x basis) and $30x of section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock, taking into account DP's 3-year holding period in the stock as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As adjusted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, DP's basis in the 60 shares of CFC1 stock is $50x ($54x basis, less $4x basis reduction).

§ 1.1250-1
Gain from dispositions of certain depreciable realty.
(a)
Dispositions after December 31, 1969
—(1)
Ordinary income.
(i) In general, section 1250(a)(1) provides that, upon a disposition of an item of section 1250 property after December 31, 1969, the applicable percentage of the lower of:
(
a
) The additional depreciation (as defined in § 1.1250-2) attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 in respect of the property, or
(
b
) The excess of the amount realized on a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion (or the fair market value of the property on any other disposition) over the adjusted basis of the property,
Shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income). The amount of such gain shall be determined separately for each item (see subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) of section 1250 property. If the amount determined under (
b
) of this subdivision exceeds the amount determined under (
a
) of this subdivision, then such excess shall be treated as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For relation of section 1250 to other provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) If the amount determined under subdivision (i)(
b
) of this subparagraph exceeds the amount determined under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph, then the applicable percentage of the lower of:
(
a
) The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, or
(
b
) Such excess,
shall also be recognized as ordinary income.
(iii) If gain would be recognized upon a disposition of an item of section 1250 property under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, and if section 1250(d) applies, then the gain recognized shall be considered as recognized first under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. (See example (3)(i) of paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.1250-3.)
(2)
Meaning of terms.
(i) For purposes of section 1250, the term
disposition
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1245-1.
Section 1250 property
is, in general, depreciable real property other than section 1245 property. See paragraph (e) of this section. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section for meaning of the term
applicable percentage.
If, however, the property is
considered to have two or more elements with separate periods (for example, because units thereof are placed in service on different dates, improvements are made to the property, or because of the application of paragraph (h) of § 1.1250-3), see the special rules of § 1.1250-5.
(ii) For purposes of applying section 1250, the facts and circumstances of each disposition shall be considered in determining what is the appropriate item of section 1250 property. In general, a building is an item of section 1250 property, but in an appropriate case more than one building may be treated as a single item. For example, if two or more buildings or structures on a single tract or parcel (or contiguous tracts or parcels) of land are operated as an integrated unit (as evidenced by their actual operation, management, financing, and accounting), they may be treated as a single item of section 1250 property. For the manner of determining whether an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to capital account of an item of section 1250 property or as a separate item of section 1250 property, see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of § 1.1250-5.
(3)
Sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion after December 31, 1969.
(i) In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property by a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion after December 31, 1969, the gain to which section 1250(a)(1) applies is the applicable percentage for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) multiplied by the lower of (
a
) the additional depreciation in respect of the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or (
b
) the excess (referred to as
gain realized
) of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the property.
(ii) In addition to gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, gain may also be recognized under section 1250(a)(2) and this subdivision if the gain realized exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969. In such a case, the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) and this subdivision is the applicable percentage for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) multiplied by the lower of (
a
) the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, or (
b
) the excess (referred to as
remaining gain
) of the gain realized over the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $500,000 is sold for $650,000 after December 31, 1969, and thus the gain realized is $150,000. At the time of the sale the additional depreciation in respect of the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is $190,000 and the applicable percentage is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of this section). Since the gain realized ($150,000), is lower than the additional depreciation ($190,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is $150,000 (that is, 100 percent of $150,000). No gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2).

# Example 2.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $440,000 is sold for $500,000 on December 31, 1974, and thus the gain realized is $60,000. The property was acquired on March 31, 1966. At the time of the sale, the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is $20,000, and the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $60,000. The property qualified as residential rental property for each taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and the applicable percentage is 95 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
c
) of this section). The applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is 15 percent. Since the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($20,000), is lower than the gain realized ($60,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is $19,000 (that is, 95 percent of $20,000). In addition, gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2) since there is remaining gain of $40,000 (that is, the gain realized ($60,000) minus the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($20,000)). Since the remaining gain of $40,000 is lower than the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($60,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $6,000 (that is, 15 percent of $40,000). The remaining $35,000 (that is, gain realized $60,000, minus gain recognized under section 1250(a), $25,000) of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
(4)
Other dispositions after December 31, 1969.
(i) In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property after December 31, 1969, other than by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain to which section 1250(a)(1) applies is the applicable percentage for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) multiplied by the lower of (
a
) the additional depreciation in respect of the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or (
b
) the excess (referred to as
potential gain
) of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis. In addition, if the potential gain exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, then the gain to which section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable percentage for the property (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) multiplied by the lower of (
c
) the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, or (
d
) the excess (referred to as
remaining potential gain
) of the potential gain over the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969. If property is transferred by a corporation to a shareholder for an amount less than its fair market value in a sale or exchange, for purposes of applying section 1250 such transfer shall be treated as a disposition other than by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Section 1250 property having an adjusted basis of $500,000 and a fair market value of $550,000 is distributed by a corporation to a stockholder in complete liquidation of the corporation after December 31, 1969, and thus the potential gain is $50,000. At the time of the liquidation, the additional depreciation for the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is $80,000 and the applicable percentage is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of this section). Since the potential gain of $50,000 is lower than the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($80,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is $50,000 (that is, 100 percent of $50,000) even though in the absence of section 1250, section 336 would preclude recognition of gain to the corporation.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the fair market value of the property is $650,000, and thus the potential gain is $150,000. Since the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($80,000), is lower than the potential gain of $150,000, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is $80,000 (that is, 100 percent of $80,000). In addition, section 1250(a)(2) applies since there is remaining potential gain of $70,000, that is, potential gain ($150,000) minus additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($80,000). The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $90,000 and the applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is 50 percent. Since the remaining potential gain of $70,000 is lower than the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($90,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $35,000 (that is, 50 percent of $70,000). Thus under section 1250(a), $115,000 (that is, $80,000 under section 1250(a)(1), plus $35,000 under section 1250(a)(2)) is recognized as ordinary income, even though in the absence of section 1250, section 336 would preclude recognition of gain to the corporation.
(5)
Instances of nonapplication.
(i) Section 1250(a)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1250(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is considered section 1250 property, nor does the section apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(ii) In general, in the case of section 1250 property with a holding period under section 1223 of more than 1 year, section 1250(a)(1) does not apply if for periods after December 31, 1969, there are no
depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line
(as computed under section 1250(b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1250-2).
(6)
Allocation rules.
(i) In the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of section 1250 property and nonsection 1250 property in one transaction after December 31, 1969, the total amount realized upon the disposition shall be allocated between the section 1250 property and the other property in proportion to their respective fair market values. Such allocation shall be made in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph (a)(5)
of § 1.1245-1 (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property).
(ii) If an item of section 1250 property has two (or more) applicable percentages because one subdivision of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section applies to one portion of the taxpayer's holding period (determined under § 1.1250-4) and another subdivision of such paragraph applies with respect to another such portion, then the gain realized on a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, or the potential gain in the case of any other disposition, shall be allocated to each such portion of the taxpayer's holding period after December 31, 1969, in the same proportion as the additional depreciation with respect to such item for such portion bears to the additional depreciation with respect to such item for the entire holding period after December 31, 1969.
(b)
Dispositions before January 1, 1970
—(1)
Ordinary income.
In general, section 1250(a)(2) provides that, upon a disposition of an item of section 1250 property after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1970, the applicable percentage of the lower of:
(i) The additional depreciation (as defined in § 1.1250-2) attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, in respect of the property, or
(ii) The excess of the amount realized on a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion (or the fair market value of the property on any other disposition) over the adjusted basis of the property,
shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income). The amount of such gain shall be determined separately for each item (see subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) of section 1250 property. For relation of section 1250 to other provisions, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Meaning of terms.
(i) For purposes of section 1250, the term
disposition
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1245-1.
Section 1250 property
is, in general, depreciable real property other than section 1245 property. See paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
applicable percentage
means 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month the property was held after the date on which the property was held 20 full months. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If, however, the property is considered to have two or more elements with separate holding periods (for example, because units thereof are placed in service on different dates, or improvements are made to the property), see the special rules of § 1.1250-5.
(ii) For purposes of applying section 1250, the facts and circumstances of each disposition shall be considered in determining what is the appropriate item of section 1250 property. In general, a building is an item of section 1250 property, but in an appropriate case more than one building may be treated as a single item. For manner of determining whether an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to the capital account of an item of section 1250 property or as a separate item of section 1250 property, see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of § 1.1250-5.
(3)
Sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion before January 1, 1970.
(i) In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property by a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion before January 1, 1970, the gain to which section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable percentage for the property multiplied by the lower of (
a
) the additional depreciation in respect of the property or (
b
) the excess (referred to as
gain realized
) of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the property.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Section 1250 property, which has an adjusted basis of $200,000, is sold for $290,000 before January 1, 1970. At the time of the sale the additional depreciation in respect of the property is $130,000 and the applicable percentage is 60 percent. Since the gain realized ($90,000, that is, amount realized, $290,000, minus adjusted basis, $200,000) is lower than the additional depreciation ($130,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $54,000 (that is, 60 percent of $90,000). The remaining $36,000 ($90,000 minus $54,000) of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
(4)
Other dispositions before January 1, 1970.
(i) In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property before January 1, 1970, other than by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain to which section 1250(a)(2) applies is the applicable percentage for the property multiplied by the lower of (
a
) the additional depreciation in respect of the property, or (
b
) the excess (referred to as
potential gain
) of the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition over its adjusted basis. If property is transferred by a corporation to a shareholder for an amount less than its fair market value in a sale or exchange, for purposes of applying section 1250 such transfer shall be treated as a disposition other than by way of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Assume the same facts as in the example in subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph except that the property is distributed by a corporation to a stockholder before January 1, 1970, in complete liquidation of the corporation, and that at the time of the distribution the fair market value of the property is $370,000. Since the additional depreciation ($130,000) is lower than the potential gain of $170,000 (that is, fair market value, $370,000, minus adjusted basis, $200,000), the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) is $78,000 (that is, 60 percent of $130,000) even though, in the absence of section 1250, section 336 would preclude recognition of gain to the corporation.
(5)
Instances of nonapplication.
(i) Section 1250(a)(2) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1250(a)(2) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is considered section 1250 property, nor does the section apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(ii) In general, in the case of section 1250 property with a holding period under section 1223 of more than one year, section 1250(a)(2) does not apply if for periods after December 1, 1963, there are no
depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line
(as computed under section 1250(b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1250-2).
(iii) In a case in which section 1250 property (including each element thereof, if any) has a holding period under § 1.1250-4 (or paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5) of at least 10 years, section 1250(a)(2) does not apply. If within the 10-year period preceding the date the property is disposed of, an element is added to the property by reason, for example, of an addition to capital account, see § 1.1250-5.
(6)
Allocation rule.
In the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of section 1250 property and nonsection 1250 property in one transaction before January 1, 1970, the total amount realized upon the disposition shall be allocated between the section 1250 property and the other property in proportion to their respective fair market values. Such allocation shall be made in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1 (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property).
(c)
Relation of section 1250 to other provisions
—(1)
General.
The provisions of section 1250 apply notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. See section 1250(i). Thus, unless an exception or limitation under section 1250(d) and § 1.1250-3 applies, gain under section 1250(a) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1250 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1250(a) upon a disposition will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See the example in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Nonrecognition sections overridden.
The nonrecognition provisions of subtitle A of the Code which section 1250 overrides include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, 501(a), and 512(b)(5). See section 1250(d) for the extent to which section 1250(a) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a),
374(a), 721, 731, 1031, 1033, 1039, 1071, and 1081 (b)(1) and (d)(1)(A). For amount of additional depreciation in respect of property disposed of by an organization exempt from income taxes (within the meaning of section 501(a)), see paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1250-2.
(3)
Exempt income.
The fact that section 1250 provides for recognition of gain as ordinary income does not change into taxable income any income which is exempt under section 115 (relating to income of States, etc.), 892 (relating to income of foreign governments), or 894 (relating to income exempt under treaties).
(4)
Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1250.
Section 1250 does not prevent gain which is not recognized under section 1250 from being considered as gain under another provision of the Code, such as, for example, section 1239 (relating to gain from sale of depreciable property between certain related persons). Thus, for example, if section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $10,000 is sold for $17,500 in a transaction to which section 1239 applies, and if $5,000 of the gain would be recognized under section 1250(a) then the remaining $2,500 of the gain would be treated as ordinary income under section 1239.
(5)
Normal retirement of asset in multiple asset account.
Section 1250(a) does not require recognition of gain upon normal retirements of section 1250 property in a multiple asset account as long as the taxpayer's method of accounting, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.167(a)-8 (relating to accounting treatment of asset retirements), does not require recognition of such gain.
(6)
Installment method.
Gain from a disposition to which section 1250(a) applies may be reported under the installment method if such method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such case, the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1250(a) applies until all such gain has been reported, and the remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of other gain. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483.
(d)
Applicable percentage
—(1)
Definition for purposes of section 1250(a)(1).
(i) For purposes of section 1250(a)(1), the term
applicable percentage
means:
(
a
) In the case of property disposed of pursuant to a written contract which was, on July 24, 1969, and at all times thereafter binding on the owner of the property, 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month the property was held after the date on which the property was held 20 full months;
(
b
) In the case of property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 1975, with respect to which a mortgage is insured under section 221(d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act, or housing is financed or assisted by direct loan or tax abatement under similar provisions of State or local laws, and with respect to which the owner is subject to the restrictions described in section 1039(b)(1)(B) (relating to approved dispositions of certain Government-assisted housing projects), 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month of the taxpayer's holding period for the property (determined under § 1.1250-4) during which the property qualified under this sentence, beginning after the date on which the property so qualified for 20 full months.
(
c
) In the case of residential rental property (as defined in section 167(j)(2)(B)) other than that covered by (
a
) and (
b
) of this subdivision, 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month of the taxpayer's holding period for the property (determined under § 1.1250-4) included within a taxable year for which the property qualified as residential rental property, beginning after the date on which the property so qualified for 100 full months.
(
d
) In the case of property with respect to which a deduction was allowed under section 167(k) (relating to the depreciation of expenditures to rehabilitate low-income rental housing), 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month of the taxpayer's holding period (determined under § 1.1250-4) beginning 100 full months after the date on which the property was placed in service.
(
e
) In the case of all other property, 100 percent.
The provisions of (a), (b), and (c) of this subdivision shall not apply with respect to additional depreciation described in section 1250(b)(4). If the taxpayer's holding period under § 1.1250-4 includes a period before January 1, 1970, such period shall be taken into account in applying each provision of this subdivision.
(ii) A single item of property may have two (or more) applicable percentages under the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. For example, if the provision of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph which applies to an item of section 1250 property (or to an element of such property if the property is treated as consisting of more than one element under § 1.1250-5) in the taxable year in which the item (or element) is disposed of did not apply to the item (or element) in a prior taxable year which is included within the taxpayer's holding period under § 1.1250-4 and which ends after December 31, 1969, then each provision of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall apply only for the period during which the property qualified under such provision.
(iii) If the taxpayer makes rehabilitation expenditures and elects to compute depreciation under section 167(k) with respect to the property attributable to the rehabilitation expenditures, such property will generally constitute a separate improvement under paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5 and therefore will constitute an element of section 1250 property. For computation of applicable percentage and gain recognized under section 1250(a) in such a case, see paragraph (a) of § 1.1250-5.
(iv) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Section 1250 property is sold on December 31, 1970, pursuant to a written contract which was binding on the owner of the property on July 24, 1969, and at all times thereafter. The property was acquired on July 31, 1968. The applicable percentage for the property under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph is 91 percent, since the property was held 29 full months.

# Example 2.
Section 1250 property is sold on June 30, 1978. The property was acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on June 30, 1966. Subdivision (i)(
e
) of this subparagraph applies to the property in 1977 and 1978. However, subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph applied to the property for the taxable years of 1970 through 1976. Thus, the property has two applicable percentages under this subparagraph. The period before January 1, 1970 (42 full months), and the period from 1970 through 1976 (84 full months) are both taken into account in determining the applicable percentage under subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph. Thus, the applicable percentage is 74 percent (that is, 100 percent minus the excess of the holding period taken into account (126 full months) over 100 full months). The applicable percentage for the years 1977 and 1978 is 100 percent under subdivision (i)(
e
) of this subparagraph.

# Example 3.
Section 1250 property is sold on December 31, 1978. The property was acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on December 31, 1969. The taxpayer made rehabilitation expenditures in 1973 and properly elected to compute depreciation under section 167(k) on the property attributable to the expenditures for the 60-month period beginning on January 1, 1974, the date such property was placed in service. Subdivision (i)(
c
) applies to the property (other than the property with respect to which a deduction was allowed under section 167(k)) for the taxable years of 1970 through 1978 (108 full months) and the applicable percentage for such property is 92 percent. The applicable percentage for the property with respect to which a deduction under section 167(k) was allowed is 100 percent under subdivision (i)(
d
) of this subparagraph, since the holding period for purposes of such subdivision begins on the date such property is placed in service.

# Example 4.
Section 1250 property is sold by a calendar year taxpayer on March 31, 1974. The property was transferred to the taxpayer by gift on December 31, 1970, and under section 1250(e)(2), the taxpayer's holding period for the property for purposes of computing the applicable percentage includes the transferor's holding period of 80 full months. Subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph applies to the property in the years 1970 through 1974. The applicable percentage under subdivision (i) (
c
) of this subparagraph is 81 percent, since the period before January 1, 1970 (68 full months), and that portion of the period after December 31, 1969, during which such subdivision applied (51 full months) are taken into account.
(2)
Definition for purposes of section 1250(a)(2).
For purposes of section 1250(a)(2), the term
applicable percentage
means:
(i) In case of property with a holding period of 20 full months or less, 100 percent;
(ii) In case of property with a holding period of more than 20 full months but less than 10 years, 100 percent minus 1 percentage point for each full month
the property is held after the date on which the property is held 20 full months; and
(iii) In case of property with a holding period of at least 10 years, zero.
(3)
Holding period.
For purposes of this paragraph, the holding period of property shall be determined under the rules of § 1.1250-4, and not under the rules of section 1223, notwithstanding that the property was acquired on or before December 31, 1963. In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property which consists of 2 or more elements (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5), the holding period for each element shall be determined under the rules of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5.
(4)
Full month.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
full month
(or
full months
) means the period beginning on a date in 1 month and terminating on the date before the corresponding date in the next succeeding month (or in another succeeding month), or, if a particular succeeding month does not have such a corresponding date, terminating on the last day of such particular succeeding month.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Property is purchased on January 17, 1959. Under paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1250-4, its holding period begins on January 18, 1959, and thus at any time during the period beginning on October 17, 1960, and ending on November 16, 1960, the property is considered held 21 full months and has an applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) of 99 percent. On and after January 17, 1969, the property has a holding period of at least 120 full months (10 years) and, therefore, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) for the property is zero. Accordingly, no gain would be recognized under section 1250(a)(2) upon disposition of the property. If, however, the property consists of two or more elements, see the special rules of § 1.1250-5.

# Example 2.
Property is purchased on January 31, 1968. Under paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1250-4 its holding period begins on February 1, 1968, and thus at any time during the period beginning on February 29, 1968, and ending on March 30, 1968, the property is considered held 1 full month. At any time during the period beginning on March 31, 1970, and ending on April 29, 1970, the property is considered held 26 full months. At any time during the period beginning on April 30, 1970, and ending on May 30, 1970, the property is considered held 27 full months.
(e)
Section 1250 property
—(1)
Definition.
The term
section 1250 property
means any real property (other than section 1245 property, as defined in section 1245(a)(3) and § 1.1245-3) which is or has been property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167. See section 1250(c).
(2)
Character of property.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the term
is or has been property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167
shall have the same meaning as when used in paragraph (a) (1) and (3) of § 1.1245-3. Thus, if a father uses a house in his trade or business during a period after December 31, 1963, and then gives the house to his son as a gift for the son's personal use, the house is section 1250 property in the hands of the son. For exception to the application of section 1250(a) upon disposition of a principal residence, see section 1250(d)(7).
(3)
Real property.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the term
real property
means any property which is not personal property within the meaning of paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-3. The term section 1250 property includes three types of depreciable real property. The first type is intangible real property. For purposes of this paragraph, a leasehold of land or of section 1250 property is intangible real property, and accordingly such a leasehold is section 1250 property. However, a fee simple interest in land is not depreciable, and therefore is not section 1250 property. The second type is a building or its structural components within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1245-3. The third type is all other tangible real property except (
a
) property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1245-3 (relating to property used as an integral part of a specified activity or as a specified facility), and (
b
) property described in section 1245(a)(3)(D). An elevator or escalator (within the meaning of section 1245(a)(3)(C)) is not section 1250 property.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A owns and leases to B for a single lump-sum payment of $100,000 property
consisting of land and a fully equipped factory building thereon. If 30 percent of the fair market value of such property is properly allocable to the land, 25 percent to section 1250 property (the building and its structural components), and 45 percent to section 1245 property (the equipment), then 55 percent of B's leasehold is section 1250 property.
(4)
Coordination with definition of section 1245 property.
(i) Property may lose its character as section 1250 property and become section 1245 property. Thus, for example, if section 1250 property of the third type described in subparagraph (3)(i)(
a
) of this paragraph is converted to use as an integral part of manufacturing, the property would lose its character as section 1250 property and would become section 1245 property. However, once property in the hands of a taxpayer is section 1245 property, it can never become section 1250 property in the hands of such taxpayer. See also paragraph (a) (4) and (5) of § 1.1245-2.
(f)
Treatment of partnerships and partners.
If a partnership disposes of section 1250 property, the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) by the partnership and by a partner shall be determined in a manner consistent with the principles provided in paragraph (e) of § 1.1245-1. Thus, for example, a partner's distributive share of gain recognized by the partnership under section 1250(a) shall be determined in the same manner as his distributive share of gain recognized by the partnership under section 1245(a)(1) is determined, and, if required, additional depreciation in respect of section 1250 property shall be allocated to the partner in the same manner as the adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis of section 1245 property are allocated to the partner. For a further example, if on the date a partner acquires his partnership interest by way of a sale or exchange the partnership owns section 1250 property and an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property) is in effect with respect to the partnership, then such partner's additional depreciation in respect of such property on such date is deemed to be zero. For limitation on the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) in respect of a partnership and for the amount of additional depreciation in respect of partnership property after certain transactions, see paragraph (f) of § 1.1250-3. For treatment of section 1250 property as an unrealized receivable, see section 751(c).
(g)
Examples.
The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $350,000 is sold for $630,000 on December 31, 1984. The property was acquired by a calendar year taxpayer on December 31, 1969. For the taxable years from 1970 through 1980, the property qualified as residential rental property and the applicable percentage for those years is 68 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
c
) of this section). For taxable years from 1981 through 1984, the property did not qualify as residential rental property and the applicable percentage for those years is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of this section). The additional depreciation for the years from 1970 through 1980 is $120,000. The additional depreciation for the years from 1981 through 1984 is $20,000. The gain realized is $280,000 (that is, amount realized, $630,000, minus adjusted basis $350,000). The gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is computed in two steps. First, since the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1970 through 1980 ($120,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years determined under paragraph (a)(6) of this section ($240,000, that is, gain realized, $280,000, multiplied by
12/14
), the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) in the first step is $81,600, that is, 68 percent of $120,000. Second, since the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1981 through 1984 ($20,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to those years ($40,000, that is, gain realized, $280,000, multiplied by
2/14
), the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) for the years from 1981 through 1984 is $20,000 (that is, 100 percent of $20,000). The total gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) is $101,600 (that is, $81,600 plus $20,000).

# Example 2.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $400,000 is sold for $472,000 on December 31, 1978. The property was acquired on December 31, 1966. The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $40,000 and the applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is zero percent. The property qualifies as residential rental property for the years 1970 through 1976, but fails to qualify for 1977 and 1978. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the applicable percentage for the years 1970 through 1976 is 80 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
c
) of this section), and the applicable percentage for the years 1977 and 1978 is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
)
of this section). The additional depreciation attributable to the years 1970 through 1976 is $50,000, and the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1977 and 1978 is $10,000. The gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) is computed in two steps. First, since the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1970 through 1976 ($50,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years ($60,000, that is, $72,000 multiplied by
5/6
), the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in the first step is $40,000 (that is, 80 percent of $50,000). Second, since the additional depreciation attributable to 1977 and 1978 ($10,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years ($12,000, that is, $72,000 multiplied by
1/6
), the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in the second step is $10,000 (that is, 100 percent of $10,000). In addition, section 1250(a)(2) applies. However, since the applicable percentage is zero percent, none of the gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2). Thus, the remaining $22,000 (that is, gain realized, $72,000, minus gain recognized under section 1250(a), $50,000) of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that the property is disposed of on December 31, 1980. The property qualifies as residential rental property for the years 1979 and 1980. Thus, the applicable percentage for years 1970 through 1976, 1979, and 1980 is 56 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
c
) of this section). The applicable percentage for the years 1977 and 1978 is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of this section). The additional depreciation for the years 1979 and 1980 is $8,000. The gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) is computed in two steps. First, since the additional depreciation attributable to the years 1970 through 1976, 1979, and 1980 ($58,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years ($61,412, that is, $72,000 multiplied by $58,000/$68,000), the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in the first step is $32,480 (that is, 56 percent of $58,000). Second, since the additional depreciation attributable to 1977 and 1978 ($10,000) is lower than the gain realized attributable to such years ($10,588, that is, $72,000 multiplied by $10,000/$68,000) the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) in the second step is $10,000 (that is, 100 percent of $10,000). In addition section 1250(a)(2) applies. However, since the applicable percentage is zero percent, none of the gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2). Thus, the remaining $29,520 (that is, gain realized, $72,000, minus gain recognized under section 1250(a), $42,480) of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
[T.D. 7084, 36 FR 271, Jan. 8, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7193, 37 FR 12953, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.1250-2
Additional depreciation defined.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Definition for purposes of section 1250(b)(1).
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, for purposes of section 1250(b)(1), the term
additional depreciation
means:
(i) In the case of property which at the time of disposition has a holding period under section 1223 of not more than 1 year, the
depreciation adjustments
(as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) in respect of such property for periods after December 31, 1963, and
(ii) In the case of property which at the time of disposition has a holding period under section 1223 of more than 1 year, the depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line for periods after December 31, 1963, computed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)
Definition for purposes of section 1250(b)(4).
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, for purposes of section 1250(b)(4), the term
additional depreciation
means:
(i) In the case of property with respect to which a deduction under section 167(k) (relating to depreciation of expenditures to rehabilitate low-income rental housing) was allowed, which at the time of disposition has a holding period under section 1223 of not more than 1 year from the time the rehabilitation expenditures were incurred, the
depreciation adjustments
(as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) in respect of the property, and
(ii) In the case of property with respect to which a deduction under section 167(k) (relating to depreciation of expenditures to rehabilitate low-income rental housing) was allowed, which at the time of disposition has a holding period under section 1223 of more than 1 year from the time the rehabilitation expenditures were incurred, the depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line for the property, computed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
For purposes of this subparagraph, all rehabilitation expenditures which are incurred in connection with the rehabilitation of an element of section 1250 property shall be considered incurred on the date the last such expenditure is considered incurred under the accrual method of accounting, regardless of the method of accounting used by the taxpayer with regard to other items of income and expense. If the property consists of two or more elements (for example, if the property is placed in service at different times), then each element shall be treated as if it were a separate property and the expenditures attributable to each such element shall be considered incurred on the date the last such expenditure is considered incurred.
(3)
Allocation to certain periods.
With respect to a taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964, or beginning in 1969 and ending in 1970, the amount of depreciation adjustments or of depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line (as the case may be) shall be ascertained by applying the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.167(a)-8 (relating to determination of adjusted basis of retired asset), and the amount determined in such manner shall be allocated on a daily basis in order to determine the portion thereof which is attributable to a period after December 31, 1963, or after December 31, 1969, as the case may be.
(b)
Computation of depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line shall be, in the case of any property, the excess of (i) the sum of the
depreciation adjustments
(as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) in respect of the property attributable to periods after December 31, 1963, over (ii) the sum such adjustments would have been for such periods if such adjustments had been determined for the entire period the property was held under the straight line method of depreciation (or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision in paragraph (c) of this section). Depreciation in excess of straight line may arise, for example, if the declining balance method, the sum of the years-digits method, or the units of production method is used, or for another example, if the cost of a leasehold improvement or of a leasehold is depreciated over a period which does not take into account certain renewal periods referred to in paragraph (c) of this section. For computations of depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line (or a deficit therein) both on an annual basis and on the basis of the entire period the property was held, see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.
(2)
Depreciation under section 167(k).
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line shall be, in the case of any property with respect to which a deduction was allowed under section 167(k) (relating to depreciation of expenditures to rehabilitate low-income rental housing), the excess of (i) the sum of the
depreciation adjustments
(as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) allowed in respect of the property, over (ii) the sum such adjustments would have been if such adjustments had been determined for the entire period the property was held under the straight line method of depreciation permitted by section 167(b)(1).
(3)
General rule for computing useful life and salvage value.
For purposes of computing under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph the sum of the depreciation adjustments would have been under the straight line method, if a useful life (or salvage value) was used in determining the amount allowed as a depreciation adjustment for any taxable year, such life (or value) shall be used in determining the amount such depreciation adjustment would have been for such taxable year under the straight line method. If, however, for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used as to which a useful life was not taken into account such as, for example, the units of production method, or as to which salvage value was not taken into account in determining the annual allowances, such as, for example, the declining balance method or the amortization of a leasehold improvement over the term of a lease, then, for the purpose of determining the amount such depreciation adjustment would have been under the
straight line method for such taxable year:
(i) There shall be used the useful life (or salvage value) which would have been proper if depreciation had actually been determined under the straight line method throughout the period the property was held, and
(ii) Such useful life (or such salvage value) shall be determined by taking into account for each taxable year the same facts and circumstances as would have been taken into account if the taxpayer had used such method throughout the period the property was held.
(4)
Special rule for computing useful life and salvage value (section 167(k)).
For purposes of computing under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph the sum the depreciation adjustments would have been under the straight line method, the useful life and salvage value permitted under section 167(k) shall not apply, the useful life of the property shall be determined under paragraph (b) of § 1.167(a)-1 (or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision of paragraph (c) of this section), and the salvage value of the property shall be determined under paragraph (c) of § 1.167(a)-1. Such useful life or salvage value shall be determined by taking into account for each taxable year the same facts and circumstances as would have been taken into account if the taxpayer had used the straight line method permitted under section 167(b)(1) throughout the period the property was held.
(5)
Property held before January 1, 1964.
In the case of property held before January 1, 1964:
(i) For purposes of computing under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph the sum the depreciation adjustments would have been under the straight line method, the adjusted basis of the property on such date shall be the amount such adjusted basis would have been if depreciation deductions allowed or allowable before such date had been determined under the straight line method computed in accordance with subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and
(ii) The depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line in respect of the property computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, but without regard to this subdivision, shall be reduced by the amount of depreciation adjustments less than straight line for periods before January 1, 1964, that is, by the excess (if any) of the sum the depreciation adjustments would have been for periods before January 1, 1964, under the straight line method, over the sum of the depreciation adjustments attributable to periods before such date.
(6)
Determination of additional depreciation in certain cases.
If an item of section 1250 property is subject to two (or more) applicable percentages, a separate computation of additional depreciation shall be made for the portion of the taxpayer's holding period subject to each such percentage. That is, a separate computation shall be made to determine the excess of (i) the depreciation adjustments (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for each such portion of the taxpayer's holding period after December 31, 1963, over (ii) the amount such adjustments would have been for each such portion if such adjustments were determined under the straight line method of depreciation (or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision in paragraph (c) of this section). Thus, for example, in the case of an item of section 1250 property acquired on January 1, 1968, and disposed of on January 1, 1973, if the applicable percentage for the period before January 1, 1970, were determined under paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1250-1 and the applicable percentage for the period after December 31, 1969, were determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of § 1.1250-1, the additional depreciation would be computed separately for the period before January 1, 1970, and for the period after December 31, 1969. If the additional depreciation attributable to any such portion of the taxpayer's holding period is a deficit (that is, if the depreciation adjustments for that portion are less than the amount such adjustments would have been for that portion if depreciation adjustments were determined for the entire period the property was held under the straight line method of depreciation, or, if applicable, under the lease-renewal-period provision in paragraph (c) of this section), then such deficit will
be applied to reduce the additional depreciation for other portion (or portions) of the taxpayer's holding period. (See examples (4) and (5) of subparagraph (7) of this paragraph.)
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A calendar year taxpayer sells section 1250 property on January 1, 1968, which he purchased for $10,000 on January 1, 1963. For the period of 1963 through 1967 he computed depreciation deductions in respect of the property under the declining balance method using a rate of 200 percent of the straight line rate and a proper useful life of 10 years. Under such method salvage value is not taken into account in computing annual allowances. For purposes of applying subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, if the taxpayer had used the straight line method for such period, he would have used a salvage value of $1,000, and the depreciation under the straight line method would have been $900 each year, that is, one-tenth of $10,000 minus $1,000. As of January 1, 1968, the additional depreciation for the property is $1,123, as computed in the table below:

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the taxpayer sells the section 1250 property on January 1, 1970. Assume further that as of January 1, 1968, the taxpayer elects under section 167(e)(1) to change to the straight line method. On that date the adjusted basis of the property is $3,277 ($10,000 minus $6,723). He redetermines the remaining useful life of the property to be 8 years and its salvage value to be $77, and thus takes depreciation deductions for 1968 and 1969 of $400 (the amount allowable) for each such year, that is, one-eighth of $3,200 (that is, $3,277 minus $77). For purposes of applying subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, if he had used the straight line method throughout the period he held the property, the adjusted basis of the property on January 1, 1968, would have been $5,500 ($10,000 minus $4,500), and the depreciation which would have resulted under such method for 1968 and 1969 would have been $678 for each such year, that is, one-eighth of $5,423 ($5,500 minus $77). As of January 1, 1970, the additional depreciation for the property is $567, as computed in the table below:

# Example 3.
On January 1, 1978, a calendar year taxpayer sells section 1250 property. The property, which is attributable to rehabilitation expenditures of $50,000 incurred in 1970, was placed in service on January 1, 1971. The taxpayer elected to compute depreciation for the period of 1971 through 1975 under section 167(k). Under such section salvage value is not taken into account in computing annual allowances, and the useful life of the property is deemed to be 5 years. For purposes of applying subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, if the taxpayer had used the straight line method permitted under section 167(b)(1) for such period, he would have used a salvage value of $5,000 and a useful life of 15 years. Depreciation under the straight line method would thus have been $3,000 each year,
1/15
of $45,000 (that is, $50,000 minus $5,000). As of January 1, 1978, the additional depreciation for the property is $29,000, as computed in the table below:

# Example 4.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $108,000 is sold for $146,000 on December 31, 1972, and thus the gain realized is $38,000. The property was acquired on December 31, 1963. The applicable percentage for the period before January 1, 1970, is 12 percent (paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1250-1) and the applicable percentage for the period after December 31, 1969, is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of § 1.1250-1). The additional depreciation must be computed separately for the period before January 1, 1970, and for the period after December 31, 1969. Assume that the additional depreciation for the period before January 1, 1970, is $32,000
and that there is a deficit in additional depreciation of $2,000 for the period after December 31, 1969. Accordingly, the additional depreciation for the period before January 1, 1970 ($32,000) is reduced to $30,000 by the $2,000 deficit in additional depreciation for the period after December 31, 1969. Although section 1250(a)(1) applies to the property, none of the gain is recognized as ordinary income under that section since there is a deficit in additional depreciation for the period after December 31, 1969. Gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2) since there is remaining gain of $38,000 (that is, gain realized, $38,000, minus the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, zero). Since the additional depreciation attributable to the period before January 1, 1970 ($30,000), is lower than the gain realized ($38,000), the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) is $3,600 (that is, 12 percent of $30,000).

# Example 5.
Section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis of $207,000 is sold for $267,000 on February 24, 1988, and thus the gain realized is $60,000. The property was acquired on April 30, 1970. The applicable percentage for the period from April 30, 1970, through December 31, 1981, is 60 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(c) of § 1.1250-1) and the applicable percentage for the period from January 1, 1982, through February 24, 1988, is 100 percent (paragraph (d)(1)(i)(e) of § 1.1250-1). The additional depreciation must be computed separately for the period before January 1, 1982, and for the period after December 31, 1981. Assume that the additional depreciation for the period before January 1, 1982, is $43,000 and that there is a deficit in additional depreciation of $6,000 for the period after December 31, 1981. Accordingly, the additional depreciation for the period before January 1, 1982 ($43,000), is reduced to $37,000 by the $6,000 deficit for the period after December 31, 1981. There is no gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) for the period after December 31, 1981, since there is a deficit in additional depreciation for that period. The gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) for the period before January 1, 1982, is $22,200, that is, the lower of the gain realized attributable to that period ($60,000) or the additional depreciation attributable to that period ($37,000), or $37,000, multiplied by 60 percent, the applicable percentage.
(c)
Property held by lessee
—(1)
Amount depreciation would have been.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, in case of a leasehold which is section 1250 property, in determining the amount the depreciation adjustments would have been under the straight line method in respect of any building or other improvement (which is section 1250 property) erected or made on the leased property, or in respect of any cost of acquiring the lease, the lease period shall be treated as including all renewal periods. See section 1250(b)(2). For determination of the extent to which a leasehold is section 1250 property, see paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.1250-1.
(2)
Renewal period.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph, the term
renewal period
means any period for which the lease may be renewed, extended, or continued pursuant to an option or options exercisable by the lessee (whether or not specifically provided for in the lease) except that the inclusion of one or more renewal periods shall not extend the period taken into account by more than two-thirds of the period on the basis of which the depreciation adjustments were allowed.
(ii) In respect of the cost of any building erected (or other improvement made) on the leased property by the lessee, or in respect of the portion of the cost of acquiring a leasehold which is attributable to an existing building (or other improvement) on the leasehold at the time the lessee acquires the leasehold, the inclusion of one or more renewal periods shall not extend the period taken into account to a period which exceeds the useful life remaining, at the time the leasehold is disposed of, of such building (or such other improvement). Determinations under this subdivision shall be made without regard to the proper period under section 167 or 178 for depreciating or amortizing a leasehold acquisition cost or improvement.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Assume that a leasehold improvement with a useful life of 30 years is properly amortized on the basis of a 10-year initial lease term. The lease is renewable for an additional 9 years. The period taken into account is 16
2/3
years, that is, 10 years plus two-thirds of 10 years. If, however, the leasehold improvement were disposed of at the end of 12 years, and if its remaining useful life were only 3 years, then the period taken into account would be 15 years.
(d)
Depreciation adjustments
—(1)
General.
For purposes of this section, the term
depreciation adjustments
means, in respect of any property, all adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis of
such property on account of deductions described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph allowed or allowable (whether in respect of the same or other property) to the taxpayer or to any other person. For cases where the taxpayer can establish that the amount allowed for any period was less than the amount allowable, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. For determination of adjusted basis of property in a multiple asset account, see paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.167(a)-8. The term
depreciation adjustments
as used in this section does not have the same meaning as the term
adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis
as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1245-2.
(2)
Deductions.
The deductions described in this subparagraph are allowances (and amounts treated as allowances) for depreciation or amortization (other than amortization under section 168, 169 (as enacted by section 704(a), Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 667)), or 185). Thus, for example, such deductions include a reasonable allowance for exhaustion, wear, and tear (including a reasonable allowance for obsolesence) under section 167, the periodic deductions referred to in § 1.162-11 in respect of a specified sum paid for the acquisition of a leasehold and in respect of the cost to a lessee of improvements on property of which he is the lessee. However, such deductions do not include deductions for the periodic payment of rent.
(3)
Depreciation of other taxpayers or in respect of other property.
(i) The depreciation adjustments (reflected in the adjusted basis) referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (
a
) are not limited to adjustments with respect to the property disposed of, nor to those allowed or allowable to the taxpayer disposing of such property, and (
b
) except as provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, are taken into account, whether allowed or allowable in respect of the same or other property and whether to the taxpayer or to any other person. For manner of determining the amount of additional depreciation after certain dispositions, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
On January 1, 1966, a calendar year taxpayer purchases for $100,000 a building for use in his trade or business. He takes depreciation deductions of $20,000 (the amount allowable), of which $3,000 is additional depreciation, and transfers the building to his son as a gift on January 1, 1968. Since the exception for gifts in section 1250(d)(1) applies, the taxpayer does not recognize gain under section 1250(a)(2). In the son's adjusted basis of $80,000 for the building there is reflected $3,000 of additional depreciation. On January 1, 1969, after taking a depreciation deduction of $10,000 (the amount allowable), of which $1,000 is additional depreciation, the son sells the building. At the time of the sale the additional depreciation is $4,000 ($3,000 allowed the father plus $1,000 allowed the son).
(4)
Depreciation allowed or allowable.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, generally all deductions (described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) allowed or allowable shall be taken into account. See section 1016(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder for the meaning of
allowed
and
allowable.
However, if a taxpayer can establish by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that the amount allowed for any period was less than the amount allowable for such period, the amount to be taken into account for such period shall be the amount allowed. The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of computing under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section the amount such deductions would have been under the straight line method.
(ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
In the year 1969 it becomes necessary to determine the additional depreciation in respect of section 1250 property, the adjusted basis of which reflects a depreciation adjustment of $1,000 with respect to depreciation deductions allowable for the calendar year 1965 under the sum of the years-digits method. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the depreciation which would have resulted under the straight line method for 1965 is $800. If the taxpayer can establish by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that he did not take, and was not allowed, any deduction for depreciation in respect of the property in 1965, then, for purposes of computing the depreciation adjustments in excess of straight line in respect of the property, the amount to be taken into account for 1965 as allowed or allowable is
zero, and the amount to be taken into account in computing deductions which would have resulted under the straight line method in 1965 is $800. Thus, in effect, there is a deficit in additional depreciation for 1965 of $800.
(5)
Retired or demolished property.
Depreciation adjustments referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph generally do not include adjustments in respect of retired or demolished portions of an item of section 1250 property. If a retired or demolished portion is replaced in a disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions), see paragraph (d)(7) of § 1.1250-3.
(6)
Exempt organization.
In respect of property disposed of by an organization which is or was exempt from income taxes (within the meaning of section 501(a), the depreciation adjustments (reflected in the adjusted basis) referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall include only adjustments allowed or allowable (i) in computing unrelated business taxable income (as defined in section 512(a)), or (ii) in computing taxable income of the organization for a period during which it was not exempt or, by reason of the application of section 502, 503, or 504, was denied its exemption.
(e)
Additional depreciation immediately after certain acquisitions
—(1)
Zero.
If on the date a person acquires property his basis for the property is determined solely (i) by reference to its cost (within the meaning of section 1012), (ii) by reason of the application of section 301(d) (relating to basis of property received in corporate distribution) or section 334(a) (relating to basis of property received in a liquidation in which gain or loss is recognized), or (iii) under the rules of section 334 (b)(2) or (c) (relating to basis of property received in certain corporate liquidations), then on such date the additional depreciation for the property is zero.
(2)
Transactions referred to in section 1250(d).
In the case of property acquired in a disposition described in section 1250(d) (relating to exceptions and limitations to application of section 1250), additional depreciation shall be computed in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-3.
(f)
Records to be kept and information to be filed
—(1)
Records to be kept.
In any case in which it is necessary to determine the additional depreciation of an item of section 1250 property, the taxpayer shall have available permanent records of all the facts necessary to determine with reasonable accuracy the amount of such additional depreciation, including the following:
(i) The date, and the manner in which, the property was acquired,
(ii) The taxpayer's basis on the date the property was acquired and the manner in which the basis was determined,
(iii) The amount and date of all adjustments to the basis of the property allowed or allowable to the taxpayer for depreciation adjustments referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the amount and date of any other adjustments by the taxpayer to the basis of the property, and
(iv) In the case of section 1250 property which has an adjusted basis reflecting depreciation adjustments referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section taken by the taxpayer with respect to other property, or by another taxpayer with respect to the same or other property, the information described in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph with respect to such other property or such other taxpayer.
(2)
Information to be filed.
If a taxpayer acquires in a transaction (other than a like kind exchange or involuntary conversion described in section 1250(d)(4)) section 1250 property which has a basis reflecting depreciation adjustments referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section allowed or allowable to another taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall file with its income tax return or information return for the taxable year in which the property is acquired a statement showing all information described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. See section 6012 (relating to persons required to make returns of income) and part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code (relating to information returns).
[T.D. 7084, 36 FR 273, Jan. 8, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7193, 37 FR 12956, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.1250-3
Exceptions and limitations.
(a)
Exception for gifts
—(1)
General rule.
Section 1250(d)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
gift
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-4. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of section 1250 property, see section 170(e) and paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.170-1.
(2)
Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.
Where a disposition of property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the disposition shall be subject to the provisions of § 1.1250-1 and the gain to which section 1250(a) applies, shall be computed under that section.
(3)
Treatment of property in hands of transferee.
If property is disposed of in a transaction which is a gift:
(i) The additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to (a) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus (b) the amount of any gain (in case the disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift) which would have been taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition if the applicable percentage had been 100 percent.
(ii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period under section 1250(e)(2) of property received as a gift in the hands of the transferee includes the transferor's holding period,
(iii) In case of a disposition which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, if the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements), and
(iv) If the property disposed of consists of two or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) On May 15, 1967, Smith transfers section 1250 property to his son for $45,000. In the hands of Smith the property had an adjusted basis of $40,000 and a fair market value of $70,000. Thus, the gain realized is $5,000 (amount realized, $45,000, minus adjusted basis, $40,000), and Smith has made a gift of $25,000 (fair market value, $70,000, minus amount realized, $45,000).
(ii) Smith's holding period for the property is 80 full months and, thus, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 40 percent. The additional depreciation for the property is $10,000. Since the gain realized ($5,000) is lower than the additional depreciation ($10,000), Smith recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) gain of $2,000 (that is, applicable percentage, 40 percent, multiplied by gain realized, $5,000) and the $3,000 remaining portion of the gain realized may be treated as gain from the sale of property described in section 1231.
(iii) On the date the son receives the property, the additional depreciation for the property in his hands is $5,000, that is, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the father immediately before the transfer ($10,000), minus the gain which would have been recognized under section 1250(a)(2) upon the transfer if the applicable percentage had been 100 percent ($5,000); for purposes of computing applicable percentage his holding period is his father's holding period of 80 full months; and under § 1.1015-4 his unadjusted basis for the property is $45,000, that is, the amount he paid ($45,000) plus the excess (zero) of his father's adjusted basis over such amount.
(iv) The son sells the property for $80,000 on March 15, 1968, 10 full months after he received it from his father. Thus, his holding period is 90 full months (his father's holding period of 80 full months plus the 10 full months the son actually owned the property) and the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 30 percent. Assume that no depreciation was allowed or allowable to the son. Thus, the son's adjusted basis and additional depreciation for the property on the date of the sale is the same as on the date he received it. Accordingly, the gain realized is $35,000 (selling price of $80,000, minus adjusted basis of $45,000). Since the additional depreciation ($5,000) is lower than the gain realized ($35,000), the son recognizes as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) gain of $1,500, that is, applicable percentage (30 percent) multiplied by additional depreciation ($5,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the son sells the property on June 15, 1969, 25 full months after he received it from his father. Thus, his holding period is 105 full months (his father's holding period of 80 full months plus the 25 full months the son actually owned the property) and the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 15 percent. Assume further that on the date of the sale the adjusted basis of the property is $39,000, and that for the period the son actually owned the property there is a deficit in additional depreciation of $2,000. Accordingly, the gain realized is $41,000 (selling price of $80,000, minus adjusted basis of $39,000), and the additional depreciation for the property is $3,000 (that is, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the son on the date he received it, as determined in example (1), $5,000, minus the amount of the deficit in additional depreciation for the period the son actually owned the property, ($2,000). Since the additional depreciation ($3,000) is lower than the gain realized ($41,000), the son recognizes as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) gain of $450, that is, applicable percentage (15 percent) multiplied by additional depreciation ($3,000).
(b)
Exception for transfers at death
—(1)
General rule.
Section 1250(d)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
transfer at death
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-4.
(2)
Treatment of transferee.
(i) If as of the date a person acquires property from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then (
a
) on the date of death the additional depreciation for the property is zero, and (
b
) for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period of the property under section 1250(e)(1)(A) is deemed to begin on the day after the date of death.
(ii) If property is acquired in a transfer at death to which section 1250(d)(2) applies, the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer shall be the amount (if any) of the additional depreciation in respect of the property allowed the transferee before the decedent's death, but only to the extent that the basis of the property (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under the second sentence of section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis where property is acquired from a decedent prior to his death) by depreciation adjustments referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1250-2 which give rise to such additional depreciation. For treatment of such property as having a special element with additional depreciation so computed, see paragraph (c)(5)(i) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with two or more elements). For purposes of determining applicable percentage, such special element shall have a holding period which includes the transferee's holding period for such property for the period before the decedent's death.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 6, 1966, Smith dies owning an item of section 1250 property. On March 7, 1968, the executor distributes the property to Smith's son pursuant to a specific bequest of the property in Smith's will. Under section 1014(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1014-4, the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the son is its fair market value on March 6, 1966 (the date Smith died), and the son is considered to have acquired the property on such date. Under section 1250(e)(1)(A), the son's holding period for the property begins on March 7, 1966 (the day after the day he is considered to have acquired the property). Thus, on March 7, 1968 (the date the property was distributed to the son), the holding period for the property is 24 full months, and the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 96 percent. On such date, the additional depreciation for the property includes any additional depreciation in respect of the property for the period the property was possessed by the estate.

# Example 2.
H purchases section 1250 property in 1965 which he immediately conveys to himself and W, his wife, as tenants by the entirety. Under local law each spouse is entitled to one-half the income from the property. H and W file joint income tax returns for calendar years 1965, 1966, and 1967. Over the 3 years, depreciation allowed in respect of the property was $4,000 (the amount allowable) of which $500 is additional depreciation. One-half of these amounts are allocable to W. Thus, depreciation deductions of $2,000, of
which $250 is additional depreciation, are allowable to W. On January 1, 1968, H dies and the entire value of the property at the date of death is included in H's gross estate. Since W's basis for the property (determined under section 1014(a)) is reduced (under the second sentence of section 1014(b)(9)) by the $2,000 depreciation deductions allowed W before H's death of which $250 is additional depreciation, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of W immediately after H's death is $250.
(c)
Limitation for certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General.
Section 1250(d)(3) provides that upon a transfer of property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1250). For purposes of this subparagraph, in case of a transfer of both section 1250 property and nonsection 1250 property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1250 property shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1250 property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1250) which shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a). Section 1250(d)(3) does not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Transfers covered.
The transfers described in this subparagraph are transfers of property in which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80 percent or more controlled subsidiary corporation). For application of section 1250(d)(3) to such a complete liquidation, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply.
(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).
(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).
(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).
(vi) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest).
(vii) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For special carryover basis rule, see section 1250(d)(6)(A) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of property in hands of transferee.
In the case of a transfer described in subparagraph (2) (other than subdivision (vii) thereof) of this paragraph:
(i) The additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to (
a
) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus (
b
) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition (taking into account the applicable percentage for the property),
(ii) For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period under section 1250(e)(2) of the property in the hands of the transferee includes the transferor's holding period,
(iii) If the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds its adjusted basis immediately before the transferee, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements), and
(iv) If the property disposed of consists of 2 or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and
the holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Green transfers section 1250 property on March 1, 1968, to a corporation, which is not exempt from taxation, in exchange for cash of $9,000 and stock in the corporation worth $91,000, in a transaction qualifying under section 351. Thus, the amount realized is $100,000 ($9,000 plus $91,000). The property has an applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) of 60 percent, an adjusted basis of $40,000, and additional depreciation of $20,000. The gain realized is $60,000, that is, amount realized ($100,000) minus adjusted basis ($40,000). Since the additional depreciation ($20,000) is lower than the gain realized ($60,000), the amount of gain which would be treated as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) would be $12,000 (60 percent of $20,000) if the limitation provided in section 1250(d)(3) did not apply. Since under section 351(b) gain in the amount of $9,000 would be recognized to the transferor without regard to section 1250, the limitation provided in section 1250(d)(3) limits the gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a)(2) to $9,000.
(ii) The amount of additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer is $5,000, that is, the amount of additional depreciation before the transfer ($20,000) minus the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) upon the transfer ($15,000, that is, $9,000 of gain recognized divided by 60 percent, the applicable percentage). (If the property is subsequently disposed of, and for the period after the initial transfer there is additional depreciation in respect of the property, then at the time of the subsequent disposition the additional depreciation will exceed $5,000. If, however, for the period after the initial transfer there was a deficit in additional depreciation, then at the time of the subsequent disposition the additional depreciation would be less than $5,000.)

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the additional depreciation is $10,000. Since additional depreciation ($10,000) is lower than the gain realized ($60,000), the amount of gain which would be treated as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2) would be $6,000 (60 percent of $10,000) if the limitation provided in section 1250(d)(3) did not apply. Since under section 351(b) gain in the amount of $9,000 would be recognized to the transferor without regard to section 1250, the limitation under section 1250(d)(3) does not prevent treatment of the entire $6,000 as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(2). The $3,000 remaining portion of the $9,000 gain may be treated as gain from the sale of property described in section 1231.
(ii) Immediately after the transfer, the amount of additional depreciation is zero, that is, the amount of additional depreciation before the transfer ($10,000) minus the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) upon the transfer ($10,000) that is, $6,000 divided by 60 percent.

# Example 3.
(i) Miller transfers section 1250 property after December 31, 1969, to a corporation, which is not exempt from taxation, in exchange for cash of $9,000 and stock in the corporation worth $31,000, in a transaction qualifying under section 351. Thus, the amount realized is $40,000 ($9,000 plus $31,000). The property has an applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(
e
) of this section of 100 percent and an applicable percentage under paragraph (d)(2) of this section of 50 percent. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of the transfer is $24,000, and the gain realized is $16,000 (that is, amount realized, $40,000, minus adjusted basis, $24,000). The additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is $8,000 and the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is $12,000. Since the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($8,000), is lower than the gain realized ($16,000), the amount of gain which would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a)(1) would be $8,000 (100 percent of $8,000) if the limitation provided in section 1250(d)(3) did not apply. In addition, gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2) since there is a remaining potential gain of $8,000 (that is, gain realized, $16,000, minus additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($8,000)). Since the remaining potential gain ($8,000) is lower than the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($12,000), the amount of gain which would be recognized under section 1250(a)(2) would be $4,000 (50 percent of $8,000) if the limitation in section 1250(d)(3) did not apply. Since under section 351(b) gain in the amount of $9,000 would be recognized to the transferor without regard to section 1250, the limitation in section 1250(d)(3) limits the gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) to $9,000. Since the section 1250(a)(1) gain is considered as recognized first under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of § 1.1250-1, of the $9,000 of gain recognized, $8,000 is recognized under section 1250(a)(1) and $1,000 is recognized under section 1250(a)(2).
(ii) The amount of additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer is
$10,000, the amount of additional depreciation immediately before the transfer ($20,000), minus the sum of (
a
) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1) upon the transfer, $8,000 (that is, gain recognized under section 1250(a)(1), $8,000, divided by 100 percent, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(1)), plus (
b
) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) upon the transfer, $2,000 (that is, gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2), $1,000, divided by 50 percent, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2)). Of this amount, zero (that is, $8,000 minus $8,000) is attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, and $10,000 ($12,000 minus $2,000) is attributable to periods before January 1, 1970.
(d)
Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions
—(1)
Limitation on gain.
(i) Under section 1250(d)(4)(A), if property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the greater of the two limitations set forth in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph. Immediately after the transfer the basis of the acquired property shall be determined under subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) (whichever is applicable) of this paragraph, and its additional depreciation shall be computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. The holding period of the acquired property for purposes of computing applicable percentage, which is determined under section 1250(e)(1), does not include the holding period of the property disposed of. In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property and other property in one transaction, see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph. In case of a disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) of a portion of this item of property, see subparagraph (7) of this paragraph.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the first limitation is the sum of:
(
a
) The amount of gain recognized on the disposition under section 1031 or 1033 (determined without regard to section 1250), plus
(
b
) An amount equal to the cost of any stock purchased in a corporation which (without regard to section 1250) would result in nonrecognition of gain under section 1033(a)(3)(A).
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the second limitation is the excess (if any) of:
(
a
) The amount of gain which would (without regard to section 1250(d)(4)) be taken into account under section 1250(a), over
(
b
) The fair market value (or cost in the case of a transaction described in section 1033(a)(3)) of the section 1250 property acquired in the transaction.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A taxpayer receives $96,000 of insurance proceeds upon the destruction of section 1250 property by fire. If section 1250(d)(4)(A) did not apply to the disposition, $16,000 of gain would be recognized under section 1250(a). In acquisitions qualifying under section 1033(a)(3)(A), he uses $90,000 of the proceeds to purchase property similar or related in service or use to the property destroyed, of which $42,000 is for one item of section 1250 property and $48,000 is for one piece of land, and $5,000 of the proceeds to purchase stock in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning property similar or related in service or use to the property destroyed. The taxpayer properly elects under section 1033(a)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder to limit recognition of gain (determined without regard to section 1250) to $1,000, that is, the excess of the amount realized from the conversion ($96,000) over the cost of the property acquired in acquisitions qualifying under section 1033(a)(3)(A) ($95,000, that is, $90,000 plus $5,000). The amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) is $6,000, determined in the following manner:
The first limitation:
(
a
) Amount of gain recognized under section 1033(a)(3), determined without regard to section 1250(a)
$1,000
(
b
) Fair market value of stock in a corporation which qualifies under section 1033(a)(3)(A)
5,000
(
c
) Sum of (
a
) plus (
b
)
6,000
The second limitation:
(
d
) Amount of gain which would be recognized under section 1250(a) if section 1250(d)(4) did not apply
16,000
(
e
) Cost of section 1250 property acquired in transaction
42,000
(
f
) Excess of (
d
) over (
e
)
0
Since the first limitation ($6,000) exceeds the second limitation (zero), the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) is $6,000. The
balance ($10,000) of the gain realized ($16,000) is not recognized.
(2)
Basis of property purchased upon involuntary conversion into money.
(i) If section 1250 property is purchased in a compulsory or involuntary conversion to which section 1033(a)(3) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then the basis of the section 1250 property and other purchased property shall be determined under the rules prescribed in this subparagraph. See section 1250(d)(4)(D).
(ii) The total basis of all purchased property, the acquisition of which results in the nonrecognition of any part of the gain realized upon the transaction, shall be (
a
) its cost, reduced by (
b
) the portion of the total gain realized which was not recognized. To the extent that section 1250(d)(4)(A)(i) prevents the purchase of stock from resulting in nonrecognition of gain, the basis of purchased stock is its cost.
(iii) If purchased property consists of both section 1250 property and other property, the total basis computed under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be allocated between the section 1250 property (treated as a class) and the other property (treated as a class) in proportion to their respective costs, except that for purposes of this subdivision (but not subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph) the cost of the section 1250 property shall be deemed to be the excess of (
a
) its actual cost, over (
b
) the gain not taken into account under section 1250(a) by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A).
(iv) If the property acquired consists of more than one item of section 1250 property (or of more than one item of other property), the total basis of the section 1250 property (or of the other property), as computed under subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, shall be allocated to each item of section 1250 property (or other property) in proportion to their respective actual costs.
(v) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume the same facts as in the example in subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph. Assume further that the portion of the gain realized which was not recognized under section 1033(a)(3) or 1250(a) upon the transaction is $60,000, of which the gain computed under section 1250(a) which is not taken into account by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) is $10,000, that is, the excess of the gain which would have been recognized under section 1250(a) if section 1250(d)(4)(A) did not apply ($16,000) over the gain recognized under section 1250(a) ($6,000). In such example $95,000 of proceeds were used to purchase property in acquisitions qualifying under section 1033(a)(3)(A) of which $42,000 was for section 1250 property, $48,000 for land, and $5,000 for stock in a corporation. The basis of each acquired property is determined in the following manner:
(
a
) Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the total basis of the acquired properties (other than the stock) is $30,000, that is, their cost ($90,000, of which $42,000 is for section 1250 property and $48,000 is for land), reduced by the portion of the total gain realized which was not recognized ($60,000).
(
b
) Under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, such total basis is allocated between the section 1250 property and the land in proportion to their respective costs, and for this purpose the cost of the section 1250 property is considered to be $32,000, that is, its actual cost ($42,000) minus the gain not recognized under section 1250(a) by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) ($10,000). Thus, the basis of the section 1250 property is $12,000 (32/80 of $30,000), and the basis of the land is $18,000 (48/80 of $30,000).
(
c
) The basis of the purchased stock is its cost of $5,000. See last sentence of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the section 1250 property purchased for $42,000 consists of 2 items of such property ($10,500 for C, and $31,500 for D), and that the land purchased for $48,000 consists of 2 pieces of land ($12,000 for X, and $36,000 for Y). Under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, the total basis for each class of property is allocated between the individual properties of such class in proportion to their respective actual costs. Thus, the total basis of $12,000, as determined in example (1), for the section 1250 property is allocated as follows:
To C: $12,000 × ($10,500/$42,000)
$3,000
To D: $12,000 × ($31,500/$42,000)
9,000
Total
12,000
The total basis of $18,000, as determined in example (1), for the land is allocated as follows:
To X: $18,000 × ($12,000/$48,000)
$4,500
To Y: $18,000 × ($36,000/$48,000)
13,500
Total
18,000
(3)
Basis of property acquired upon involuntary conversion into similar property.
If property is involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or use in a transaction to which section 1033(a)(1) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then:
(i) The total basis of the acquired property shall be determined under the first sentence of section 1033(c), and
(ii) If more than one item of property is acquired, such total basis shall be allocated to the individual items of property acquired in accordance with the principles prescribed in subparagraph (2) (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, except that an amount equivalent to the fair market value of each item of property on the date acquired shall be treated as its actual cost.
(4)
Basis of property acquired in like kind exchange.
If section 1250 property is transferred in an exchange described in section 1031 (a) or (b), and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then:
(i) The total basis of the property (including nonsection 1250 property) acquired of the type permitted to be received under section 1031 without recognition of gain or loss shall be determined under section 1031(d), and
(ii) If more than one item of property of such type was received, such total basis shall be allocated to the individual items of property of such type in accordance with the principles prescribed in subparagraph (2) (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, except that an amount equivalent to the fair market value of each such item of property on the date received shall be treated as its actual cost.
(5)
Additional depreciation for property acquired in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.
(i) If property is disposed of in a transaction described in section 1031 or 1033, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then the additional depreciation for the acquired property immediately after the transaction (as computed under section 1250(d)(4)(E)) shall be an amount equal to the amount of gain computed under section 1250(a) which was not taken into account by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A).
(ii) In case more than one item of section 1250 property is acquired in the transaction, the additional depreciation computed under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be allocated to each such item of section 1250 property in proportion to their respective adjusted bases.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) On January 15, 1969, section 1250 property X is condemned and proceeds of $100,000 are received. On such date, X's adjusted basis is $25,000, the additional depreciation is $10,000, and the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 70 percent. Since the additional depreciation ($10,000) is less than the gain realized ($75,000, that is, $100,000 minus $25,000) the amount of gain computed under section 1250(a)(2) (without regard to section 1250(d)(4)(A)) is $7,000, that is, 70 percent of $10,000.
(b) On March 1, 1969, all the proceeds are used to purchase section 1250 property Y in a transaction qualifying under section 1033(a)(3)(A) for nonrecognition of gain. Accordingly, the gain not recognized by reason of the application of section 1033(a)(3)(A) is $75,000, of which $7,000 is gain computed under section 1250(a)(2) which is not taken into account by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A). See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(c) Immediately after the transaction, Y's basis is $25,000, that is, its cost ($100,000) minus the total gain realized which was not recognized ($75,000), and the additional depreciation (as computed under section 1250(d)(4)(E)) is $7,000, that is, the amount of gain not taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A).
(d) On December 15, 1969, before any depreciation deductions were allowed or allowable in respect of Y, Y is sold for $90,000. Under section 1250(e)(1), the holding period of Y is 9 months, and thus, under section 1250(a)(2), the applicable percentage is 100 percent. Since the additional depreciation ($7,000) is less than the gain realized ($65,000, that is $90,000 minus $25,000), the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) as ordinary income is $7,000, that is, 100 percent of $7,000.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that property Y was purchased on June 15, 1962, and that 90 full
months thereafter, or December 15, 1969, it is sold for $35,000. Thus the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 30 percent. Assume further that at the time of such sale Y's adjusted basis is $5,000 and additional depreciation in respect of Y for periods after it was acquired is $2,500. Thus, the additional depreciation at the time of the sale is $9,500, that is, the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of Y attributable to X as computed under section 1250(d)(4)(E) in (
c
) of example (1) ($7,000), plus the additional depreciation attributable to periods after Y was acquired ($2,500). Since the additional depreciation ($9,500) is less than the gain realized ($30,000, that is, $35,000 minus $5,000), the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) as ordinary income is $2,850, that is, 30 percent of $9,500.
(6)
Single disposition of section 1250 property and property of different class.
(i) For purposes of this subparagraph:
(
a
) Section 1250 property, section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)), and other property shall each be treated as a separate class of property, and
(
b
) The term
qualifying property
means property which may be acquired without recognition of gain under the applicable provision of section 1031 or 1033 (applied without regard to section 1250 or 1245) upon the disposition of property.
(ii) If upon a sale of section 1250 property gain would be recognized under section 1250(a) and if such section 1250 property together with property of a different class or classes are disposed of in one transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or 1033 (without regard to sections 1245 and 1250), then:
(
a
) The total amount realized shall be allocated between the different classes of property disposed of in proportion to their respective fair market values,
(
b
) The amount realized upon the disposition of property of a class shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of qualifying property of the same class acquired as is not in excess of the amount realized from the property of such class disposed of,
(
c
) The remaining portion (if any) of the amount realized upon the disposition of property of such class shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of any other property acquired as is not in excess of such remaining portion, and
(
d
) For purposes of applying (
c
) of this subdivision, the fair market value of acquired property shall be taken into account only once and in such manner as the taxpayer determines.
(iii) The amounts determined under this subparagraph in respect of property shall apply for all purposes of the Code.
(iv) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(a) Green owns property consisting of land and a fully equipped factory building thereon. The property is condemned and proceeds of $100,000 are received. If the property were sold for $100,000, gain of $40,000 would be recognized of which $10,000 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a). Proceeds of $95,000 are used to purchase property similar or related in service or use to the condemned property and under section 1033(a)(3)(A) (without regard to sections 1245 and 1250) recognition of gain is limited to $5,000. The fair market values by classes of the property disposed of, and of the property acquired, are summarized in the table below:
Fair market value of property

Determined by taxpayer pursuant to subdivision (ii)(d) of this subparagraph.
(
c
) Upon the disposition of the section 1245 property, only section 1245 property is acquired, and thus gain (if any) would not be recognized under section 1245(a)(1). See section 1245(b)(4). Upon the disposition of the section 1250 property gain under section 1250(a) would not be recognized by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A). See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If the gain realized on the disposition of the land is not less than $5,000, then under section 1033(a)(3)(A) the gain recognized would be $5,000, that is, an amount equal to the portion of the proceeds from the disposition of the land ($5,000) not invested in qualifying property.
(7)
Disposition of portion of property.
A disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) of a portion of an item of property gives rise to an addition to capital account described in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements). If the addition to capital account is a separate improvement within the meaning of paragraph (d) of § 1.1250-5, and thus an element, then immediately after the addition is made the amount of additional depreciation for such separate improvement shall be computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties. If the addition is not a separate improvement, then immediately after the addition is made such property is considered under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 as having a special element with the same amount of additional depreciation so computed. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period of the separate improvement or special element (as the case may be), which is determined under section 1250(e)(1), does not include the holding period of the property disposed of.
(e)
Sections 1071 and 1081 transactions
—(1)
General.
This paragraph prescribes regulations under section 1250(d)(5) which apply in the case of a disposition of section 1250 property in a transaction in which gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part by reason of the application of section 1071 (relating to gain from sale or exchange to effectuate policies of FCC) or section 1081 (relating to gain from sale or exchange in obedience to order of SEC).
(2)
Involuntary conversion treatment under section 1071.
If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part solely by reason of an election under the first sentence of section 1071(a) to treat the transaction as an involuntary conversion, the consequences of the transaction shall be determined under the principles of paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Basis reduction under sections 1071 or 1082(a)(2).
(i) If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part by reason of a reduction in basis of property pursuant to an election under section 1071(a) or the application of section 1082(a)(2), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the sum of:
(
a
) The amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1250), plus
(
b
) In case involuntary conversion treatment was also elected under section 1071(a), an amount equal to the cost of any stock purchased in a corporation which (without regard to section 1250) would result in nonrecognition of gain under section 1033(a)(3), as modified by section 1071(a), plus
(
c
) The portion of the gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to this paragraph) which is neither taken into account under (
a
) or (
b
) of this subdivision nor applied under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to reduce the basis of section 1250 property.
(ii)(
a
) The amount of gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to this paragraph) which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) (
a
) or (
b
) of this subparagraph shall be applied to the amount by which the basis of the section 1250 property was reduced under section 1071(a) or 1082(a)(2), as the case may be, before other gain (which is not gain computed under section 1250(a)) is so applied.
(
b
) If the basis of more than one item of section 1250 property was so reduced, the gain applied under (
a
) of this subdivision to all such section 1250 properties shall be applied to such items in
proportion to the amounts of their respective basis reductions.
(
c
) Any gain not applied under (
a
) of this subdivision shall be applied to the amount by which the basis of the nonsection 1250 property was reduced.
(iii) If gain computed under section 1250 is applied under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to reduce the basis of section 1250 property, the amount so applied shall be treated as additional depreciation in respect of such section 1250 property. For treatment of such section 1250 property as having a special element with additional depreciation consisting of such amount, see paragraph (c)(5)(i) of § 1.1250-5. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, such special element shall have a holding period beginning on the day after the date as of which the property's basis was so reduced.
(4)
Section 1081(d)(1)(A) transaction.
No gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon an exchange of property as to which gain is not recognized (without regard to section 1250) because of the application of section 1081(d)(1)(A) (relating to transfers within system group). For treatment of property in the hands of a transferee, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply.
(f)
Property distributed by a partnership to a partner
—(1)
General.
For purposes of section 1250 (d)(3) and (e)(2), the basis of section 1250 property distributed by a partnership to a partner shall be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership. Thus, if section 731 applies to a distribution of section 1250 property by a partnership to a partner, then even though the partner's basis is not determined for other purposes by reference to the partnership's basis, (i) the amount of gain taken into account by the partnership under section 1250(a) is limited by section 1250(d)(3) to the amount of gain recognized to the partnership upon the distribution (determined without regard to section 1250), and (ii) the holding period of the property in the hands of the partner shall, under section 1250(e)(2), include the holding period of the property in the hands of the partnership. For nonapplication of section 1250(d)(3) to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, see paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(2)
Treatment of property distributed by partnership.
(i) If section 1250 property is distributed by a partnership to a partner in a distribution in which no part of the partnership's
potential section 1250 income
in respect of the property was recognized as ordinary income to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the distributee attributable to periods before the distribution shall be an amount equal to the total potential section 1250 income of the partnership in respect of the property immediately before the distribution, recomputed as if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent. Under paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.751-1, the potential section 1250 income is, in effect, the gain to which section 1250(a) would have applied if the property had been sold by the partnership immediately before the distribution at its fair market value at such time.
(ii) If upon the distribution any potential section 1250 income in respect of the property was recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1, then after the distribution the additional depreciation shall be an amount equal to (
a
) the total potential section 1250 income in respect of the property, as recomputed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, minus (
b
) the amount of potential section 1250 income which would have been recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1 if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent.
(iii) If the partner's basis for the property immediately after the transaction exceeds the partnership's adjusted basis for the property immediately before the transaction, the excess may be an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with two or more elements).
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A partnership distributes a building to Smith on January 1, 1969, in a complete liquidation of his partnership interest to which section 736(a) does not apply. On the date of the distribution, the partnership's holding period for the property is 40 full months and, accordingly, the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 80 percent. On such date, the partnership's additional depreciation for the building ($6,250) is lower than the excess ($40,000) of its fair market value ($140,000) over adjusted basis ($100,000). Thus, under paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.751-1, the partnership's potential section 1250 income in respect of the building is $5,000 (80 percent of $6,250). Assume that section 751(b) does not apply to the distribution. Accordingly, no gain would be recognized to the partnership under section 731(b) (without regard to the application of section 1250). Smith's basis for his partnership interest was $150,000, and under section 732(b) Smith's basis for the building is equal to his basis for his partnership interest. Thus, Smith's basis for the building is not determined by reference to the partnership's basis for the building. Nevertheless, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, no gain is recognized to the partnership under section 1250(a)(2) and Smith's holding period for the property includes the partnership's holding period.
(ii) Six full months after Smith received the building in the distribution, or July 1, 1969, he sells it for $153,000. Assume that no depreciation was allowed or allowable to Smith for the building, and that the special rules under § 1.1250-5 for property with two or more elements do not apply. Since Smith's holding period for the building includes its holding period in the hands of the partnership, his holding period is 46 full months (40 full months for the partnership plus 6 full months for Smith) and the applicable percentage under section 1250(a)(2) is 74 percent.
(iii) Since no potential section 1250 income was recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1, the additional depreciation for the building attributable to periods before the distribution is determined under the provisions of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph. Under such provisions, the potential section 1250 income to the partnership, which was actually $5,000 (that is, 80 percent of $6,250), is recomputed as if the applicable percentage were 100 percent, and thus such additional depreciation is $6,250 (that is, 100 percent of $6,250). Since no depreciation was allowed or allowable for the building in Smith's hands, the additional depreciation for the building attributable to Smith's total holding period (46 full months) is $6,250. Since the gain realized ($3,000, that is, amount realized, $153,000, minus adjusted basis, $150,000), is lower than the additional depreciation ($6,250), the gain recognized to Smith under section 1250(a)(2) is $2,220 (that is, 74 percent of $3,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the facts as in example (1) except that as a result of the distribution the partnership recognizes under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1 potential section 1250 income of $1,000 (that is, 80 percent of $1,250). The additional depreciation attributable to periods before the distribution, as determined under the provisions of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, is $5,000, that is, (
a
) the total potential section 1250 income in respect of the property, recomputed in example (1) as if the applicable percentage were 100 percent ($6,250), minus (
b
) the amount of potential section 1250 income which would have been recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1 if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent ($1,250, that is, 100 percent of $1,250).
(4)
Treatment of partnership property after certain transactions.
If under paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.751-1 (relating to certain distributions of partnership property other than section 751 property treated as sales or exchanges) a partnership is treated as purchasing section 1250 property (or a portion thereof) from a distributee who relinquishes his interest in such property (or portion), then after the date of such purchase the following rules shall apply:
(i) If only a portion of the property is treated as purchased, there shall be excluded from the additional depreciation for the remaining portion any additional depreciation in respect of the purchased portion for periods before such purchase.
(ii) In respect of the purchased property (or portion), (
a
) as of the date of purchase the amount of additional depreciation shall be zero, and (
b
) for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period shall begin on the day after the date of such purchase.
(5)
Cross reference.
See paragraph (f) of § 1.1250-1 for the amount of additional depreciation for partnership property in respect of a partner who acquired his partnership interest in certain transactions when an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustments to basis of partnership property) was in effect.
(g)
Disposition of principal residence
—(1)
In general.
(i) Section 1250(d)(7)(A) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition of property by a taxpayer to the extent the property is used by the taxpayer as his principal
residence (within the meaning of section 1034(a) and the regulations thereunder, relating to a sale or exchange of residence). Thus, for example, if a doctor sells a house, of which one portion was used as his principal residence within the meaning of section 1034(a) and the other portion was properly subject to the allowance for depreciation as property used in his trade or business, then, by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)(A), section 1250(a) does not apply in respect of the disposition of the portion used as his principal residence. The provisions of this subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether section 1034 applies. Thus, for example, if section 1034 did not apply to the sale because the doctor did not invest in a new principal residence within the period specified in section 1034, nevertheless section 1250(a) would not apply to the disposition of the portion used as a principal residence.
(ii) Section 1250(d)(7)(B) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition of section 1250 property by a taxpayer who, in respect of the property, satisfies the age and ownership requirements of section 121 (relating to exclusion from gross income of gain on sale or exchange of residence of individual who has attained age 65), but only to the extent the taxpayer satisfies the use requirements of section 121 in respect of such property. Thus, if a taxpayer has attained the age of 65 before the date on which he disposes of section 1250 property, and if during the 8-year period ending on the date of the disposition the property has been owned and used by the taxpayer solely as his principal residence for periods aggregating 5 years or more, then section 1250(a) does not apply in respect to the disposition. This result would not be changed even if the taxpayer does not or cannot make the election provided for in section 121 and even if section 121 applies to only a portion of the gain because the adjusted sales price exceeds the $20,000 limitation in section 121(b)(1). If, however, only a portion of the property has been used as his principal residence for such periods aggregating 5 years or more, then, by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)(B), section 1250(a) is inapplicable only to the portion so used. For special rules for determining whether the age, ownership, and use requirements of section 121 are treated as satisfied, and for the manner of applying such requirements, see section 121(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Concurrent operation of section 1250(d)(7) with other provisions.
Upon the disposition of a principal residence, gain computed under section 1250(a) may not be recognized in whole or in part by reason of the application of both the provisions of section 1250(d)(7) and the provisions of one of the other exceptions or limitations enumerated in section 1250(d). Thus, for example, if an entire house is transferred as a gift, and if section 1250(d)(7) applies to only a portion of the house, then section 1250(d)(1) excepts the disposition of the entire house from the application of section 1250(a).
(3)
Special rule.
If by reason of section 1250(d)(7) a disposition is partially excepted from the application of section 1250(a), and if no other paragraph of section 1250(d) excepts the disposition entirely from such application, then the gain to which section 1250(a) applies shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to (i) the gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to section 1250(d)(7)), as (ii) the fair market value of the portion of the property to which the exception in section 1250(d)(7) does not apply, bears to (iii) the total fair market value of the property. Thus, for example, if under paragraph (a)(2) of this section gain of $300 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a) (without regard to section 1250(d)(7)) upon a combined sale and gift of section 1250 property, and if the property has a fair market value of $25,000 of which $10,000 is properly allocable to a portion not used as a principal residence, then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a) would be $120 (10/25 of $300).
(4)
Treatment of property in hands of transferee.
If property is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) applies, and if its basis in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(1) (relating to gifts) or section 1250(d)(3) (relating to
certain tax-free transactions), then the treatment of the property in the hands of the transferee shall be determined under paragraph (a)(3) or (c)(3) (whichever is applicable) of this section
(5)
Treatment of property acquired in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.
If property is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) (relating to principal residence) and section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) apply, then:
(i) The basis of the property acquired shall be determined under the applicable provisions of paragraph (d) (2), (3), or (4) of this section, applied as if all gain computed under section 1250(a) (except any gain not recognized solely by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)) were not taken into account by reason of section 1250(d)(4)(A),
(ii) The additional depreciation for the property acquired shall be determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, so applied, and
(iii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period of the acquired property shall be determined under section 1250(e)(1).
(6)
Treatment of property acquired in section 1034 transaction.
If a principal residence is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1034 (relating to sale or exchange of residence) the basis of property acquired in the transaction is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the taxpayer of the property disposed of, then:
(i) The additional depreciation for the acquired property immediately after the transaction shall be an amount equal to (
a
) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property disposed of, minus (
b
) the amount of any gain which would have been taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent,
(ii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period of the acquired property includes the holding period of the disposed of property (see section 1250(e)(3)),
(iii) If the adjusted basis of the acquired property exceeds the adjusted basis immediately before the transfer of the property disposed of, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with more than one element), and
(iv) If the property disposed of consisted of two or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and the holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.
(h)
Limitation for disposition of qualified low-income housing
—(1)
Limitation on gain.
(i) Under section 1250(d)(8)(A), if section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1039 (relating to certain sales of low-income housing projects), then the amount of gain recognized by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the greater of:
(
a
) The amount of gain recognized under section 1039 (determined without regard to section 1250), or
(
b
) The excess, if any, of the amount of gain which would, but for section 1250(d)(8)(A), be taken into account under section 1250(a), over the cost of the section 1250 property acquired in the transaction.
For purposes of this paragraph the term
qualified housing project, approved disposition, reinvestment period,
and
net amount realized
shall have the same meaning as in section 1039 and § 1.1039-1.
(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Taxpayer A owns a qualified housing project and makes an approved disposition of the project on January 1, 1971. The net amount realized upon the disposition is $550,000, of which $475,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. The adjusted basis of the section 1250 property is $250,000 and the gain realized on the disposition of section 1250 property is $225,000. The additional depreciation for the property is $100,000, the applicable percentage is 48 percent, and if section 1250(d)(8)(A) did not apply to the disposition, $48,000 of gain would be recognized under section 1250(a). Within the reinvestment period, A purchases a replacement qualified housing project at a cost
of $525,000, of which $425,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. A properly elects under section 1039(a) and the regulations thereunder to limit the recognition of gain (determined without regard to section 1250) to $25,000, that is, the excess of the net amount realized ($550,000) over the cost of the replacement housing project ($525,000).
(ii) The amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) is limited to $25,000, that is, the greater of (
a
) the amount of gain recognized without regard to section 1250(a) ($25,000), or (
b
) the excess of (
1
) the amount of gain which would be taken into account under section 1250(a) if section 1250(d)(8)(A) did not apply ($225,000), over (
2
) the cost of the replacement section 1250 property ($425,000), or zero.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that only $180,000 of the cost of the replacement housing project is attributable to section 1250 property. Thus, the gain recognized under section 1250(a) is limited to $45,000, the greater of (
a
) the excess of (
1
) the amount of gain which would be taken into account under section 1250(a) if section 1250(d)(8)(A) did not apply ($225,000), over (
2
) the cost of the replacement section 1250 property ($180,000), or (
b
) the amount of gain recognized without regard to section 1250 ($25,000).
(2)
Replacement project consisting of more than one element.
(i) If (
a
) section 1250 property is disposed of, (
b
) any portion of the gain which would have been recognized under section 1250(a) is not recognized by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(A), and (
c
) the cost of the replacement section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period exceeds the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of, then the section 1250 property shall consist of two elements. For purposes of this paragraph, the
reinvestment element
is that portion of the section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period the cost of which does not exceed the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of, reduced by any gain recognized with respect to such property. The
additional cost element
is that portion of the section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period whose cost exceeds the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of.
(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example 1.
(i) Taxpayer B disposes of a qualified housing project consisting of section 1250 property with an adjusted basis of $500,000 and land with a basis of $100,000. The amount realized on the disposition is $750,000 of which $650,000 is attributable to the section 1250 property. B constructs a replacement housing project at a cost of $1,000,000 of which $850,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. B elects in accordance with the provisions of section 1039(a) and the regulations there under not to recognize the $150,000 gain realized.
(ii) Under section 1250(d)(8)(A) no gain is recognized under section 1250(a). The replacement section 1250 property consists of the two elements. The reinvestment element has a cost of $650,000, i.e., that portion of the replacement section 1250 property the cost of which does not exceed the amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of ($650,000), reduced by any gain recognized with respect to such property (zero). The additional cost element has a cost of $200,000, that is, the excess of the cost of the replacement section 1250 property ($850,000) over the amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of ($650,000).
(3)
Basis of property acquired.
(i) If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1039 (relating to certain sales of low-income housing projects), then the basis of the section 1250 property and other property acquired in the transaction shall be determined in accordance with the rules of this subparagraph. Generally, the basis of the property acquired in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies is its cost reduced by the amount of any gain not recognized attributable to the property disposed of (see section 1039(d)). In a case where the replacement section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired within the reinvestment period is treated as consisting of more than one element under section 1250(d)(8)(e), the aggregate basis of the property determined under section 1039(d) shall be allocated as follows: first, to the reinvestment element of the section 1250 property, in an amount equal to the amount determined under section 1250(d)(8)(E)(i) reduced by the amount of any gain not recognized attributable
to the section 1250 property disposed of; second, to the other replacement property (other than section 1250 property) in an amount equal to the amount of its cost reduced (but not below zero) by any remaining amount of gain not recognized; and finally, to the additional cost element of the section 1250 property, in an amount equal to the amount determined under section 1250(d)(8)(E)(ii) reduced by any amount of gain not recognized which has not been taken into account in determining the basis of the reinvestment element and the other replacement property that is not section 1250 property. See paragraph (h)(2) of this section for definition of the terms
reinvestment element
and
additional cost element.
(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The facts are the same as in example (1) of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. The basis of the replacement section 1250 property is $225,000, the amount of the reinvestment element ($425,000) minus the gain not recognized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of ($200,000).

# Example 2.
Taxpayer C disposes of a qualified housing project on January 1, 1971. The adjusted basis for the project is $3,800,000, of which $3,000,000 is attributable to section 1250 property and $800,000 is attributable to land. The amount realized on the disposition is $5,000,000, of which $4,000,000 is attributable to the section 1250 property and $1,000,000 is attributable to the land. The gain realized upon the disposition is $1,200,000, that is, amount realized ($5,000,000) minus adjusted basis ($3,800,000), of which $1,000,000 is attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of. Within the reinvestment period, C purchases another qualified housing project at a cost of $5,500,000, of which $4,000,000 is attributable to section 1250 property and $1,500,000 is attributable to other property. C makes an election under section 1039(a) and the regulations thereunder and none of the $1,200,000 gain realized on the disposition is recognized (determined without regard to section 1250). Under section 1250(d)(8)(A), none of the gain realized is recognized under section 1250(a). The basis of the replacement section 1250 property is $3,000,000, that is, the amount of the reinvestment element ($4,000,000) less the amount of gain not recognized attributable to section 1250 property disposed of ($1,000,000). The basis of the other property acquired is $1,300,000, that is, its cost ($1,500,000) reduced by the remaining gain not recognized ($200,000).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that the cost of the replacement section 1250 property is $4,500,000 and the cost of the other property is $1,000,000. Thus, the replacement section 1250 property consists of two elements under section 1250(d)(8)(E). The reinvestment element (section 1250(d)(8)(E)(i)) has a basis of $3,000,000, that is $4,000,000 (that portion of the section 1250 property acquired the cost of which does not exceed the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of), reduced by $1,000,000 (the gain not recognized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of). The basis of the other property is $800,000, that is, its cost ($1,000,000) reduced by the remaining gain not recognized ($200,000). The additional cost element (section 1250(d)(8)(E)(ii)) has a basis of $500,000, that is, the portion of the section 1250 property acquired the cost of which exceeds the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of. This amount ($500,000) is not reduced by any amount of gain not recognized because all of the gain not recognized has already been taken into account in determining the basis of the reinvestment element and the other replacement property that is not section 1250 property.
(4)
Additional depreciation for property acquired.
(i) If a qualified housing project is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies, the additional depreciation for the replacement property immediately after the transaction shall be an amount equal to (
a
) the amount of additional depreciation for the property disposed of, minus (
b
) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a). Thus, if no gain is recognized upon a disposition of a qualified housing project, the additional depreciation for the property acquired will be the same as for the property disposed of. On the other hand, if upon disposition of a project, gain of $40,000 was recognized under section 1250(a), and if the additional depreciation for the project and the applicable percentage were $100,000 and 80 percent, respectively, the additional depreciation for the replacement housing project would be $50,000, that is, $100,000 minus $50,000, the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce $40,000 of recognized gain where the applicable percentage is 80 percent.
(ii) If the property acquired in the transaction consists of more than one
element of section 1250 property by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(E), the additional depreciation under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be allocated solely to the reinvestment element.
(5)
Additional limitation.
If, in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies, gain is recognized by the taxpayer, the amount of gain recognized which is attributable to section 1250 property disposed of is, under section 1250(d)(8)(F)(i), limited to an amount equal to the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of reduced by the greater of (i) the adjusted basis of the section 1250 property disposed of, or (ii) the cost of the section 1250 property acquired. The limitation of section 1250(d)(8)(F)(i) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Taxpayer D owns property constituting a qualified housing project under section 1039(b)(1). In an approved disposition, the project is sold for $225,000. The net amount realized on the disposition is $225,000 of which $175,000 is attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of. The adjusted basis of such property is $150,000 and thus the gain realized upon the disposition of the section 1250 property is $25,000. Assume that the total gain realized upon disposition of the project is $45,000. Within the reinvestment period, D purchases another qualified housing project at a cost of $200,000, of which $160,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. D elects, in accordance with section 1039(a) and the regulations thereunder, to limit the recognition of gain to $25,000, that is, the net amount realized ($225,000), minus the cost of the replacement housing project ($200,000). Under this subparagraph, $15,000 of the $25,000 gain recognized is attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of, that is, the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of ($175,000), reduced by $160,000, the greater of the adjusted basis of the section 1250 property disposed of ($150,000) or the cost of the section 1250 property acquired ($160,000).
(6)
Allocation rule.
(i) If, in a transaction to which paragraph (h)(1) of this section applies, the section 1250 property disposed of is treated as consisting of more than one element by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(8)(E) with respect to a prior transaction, then the amount of gain recognized, the net amount realized, and the additional depreciation with respect to each such element shall be allocated to the elements of the replacement section 1250 property in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.
(ii) The portion of the net amount realized upon such a disposition which shall be allocated to each element of the section 1250 property disposed of is that amount which bears the same ratio to the net amount realized attributable to all the section 1250 property disposed of in the transaction as the additional depreciation for that element bears to the total additional depreciation for all elements disposed of. If any gain is recognized upon disposition of the section 1250 property, such gain shall be allocated to each element in the same proportion as the gain realized for that element bears to the gain realized for all elements disposed of. The additional depreciation for each reinvestment element of the replacement section 1250 property shall be the same as for the corresponding element of the property disposed of, decreased by the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce the amount of gain recognized for such element. The additional depreciation for any additional cost element shall be zero.
(iii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Taxpayer E disposes of a qualified housing project in an approved disposition. The net amount realized is $1,090,000 of which $900,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. The section 1250 property consists of (1) a reinvestment element with an adjusted basis of $300,000, additional depreciation of $100,000, and an applicable percentage of 50 percent, and (2) an additional cost element with an adjusted basis of $200,000, additional depreciation of $50,000, and an applicable percentage of 80 percent. Gain of $400,000 is realized on the disposition of the section 1250 property, that is, amount realized ($900,000) minus adjusted basis ($500,000). Within the reinvestment period, E purchases another qualified housing project at a cost of $1,000,000 of which $840,000 is attributable to section 1250 property. E elects, in accordance with section 1039 and the regulations thereunder, to limit recognition of gain (determined without regard to section 1250) to $90,000, that is, the excess of the net amount realized ($1,090,000) over the cost of the replacement project ($1,000,000). Under section 1250(d)(8)(A), the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) is limited to $90,000 (see subparagraph (1) of this paragraph). Under
section 1250(d)(8)(F)(ii) and this subparagraph, $600,000 of the $900,000 net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property is allocated to the reinvestment element, that is, additional depreciation for the element ($100,000) over total additional depreciation ($150,000) times the net amount realized ($900,000). The remaining $300,000 is allocated to the additional cost element. Thus, the gain realized attributable to the reinvestment element is $300,000, that is, net amount realized ($600,000) minus adjusted basis ($300,000). The gain realized attributable to the additional cost element is $100,000, that is, net amount realized ($300,000) minus adjusted basis ($200,000). Under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the gain recognized attributable to the section 1250 property is limited to $60,000, that is, the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of ($900,000) minus the greater of the adjusted basis of such property ($500,000) or the cost of the section 1250 property acquired in the transaction ($840,000). Under section 1250(d)(8)(F)(ii) and this subparagraph, $45,000 of the $60,000 gain recognized is attributable to the reinvestment element, that is, $60,000 multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the gain realized attributable to the reinvestment element ($300,000) and whose denominator is the total gain realized attributable to all the section 1250 property ($400,000). The remaining $15,000 of the gain recognized is attributable to the additional cost element. The new property acquired has no additional cost element. The reinvestment element of the new property acquired consists of 2 subelements corresponding to the reinvestment element and additional cost element of the property disposed of. The subelement corresponding to the reinvestment element has additional depreciation of $10,000, that is, its additional depreciation immediately before the disposition ($100,000), minus $90,000, the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce $45,000 of section 1250(a) gain where the applicable percentage is 50 percent. The subelement corresponding to the additional cost element has additional depreciation of $31,250, that is, its additional depreciation immediately before the disposition ($50,000), minus $18,750, the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce $15,000 of section 1250(a) gain where the applicable percentage is 80 percent.

§ 1.1250-4
Holding period.
(a)
General.
In general, for purposes only of determining the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250 (1)(C) and (2)(B)) of section 1250 property, the holding period of the property shall be determined under the rules of section 1250(e) and this section and not under the rules of section 1223. If the property is treated as consisting of two or more elements (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1250-5), see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 for application of this section to determination of holding period of each element. Section 1250(e) does not affect the determination of the amount of additional depreciation in respect of section 1250 property.
(b)
Beginning of holding period.
(1) For the purpose of determining the applicable percentage, in the case of property acquired by the taxpayer (other than by means of a transaction referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section), the holding period of the property shall begin on the day after the date of its acquisition. See section 1250(e)(1)(A). Thus, for example, if a taxpayer purchases section 1250 property on January 1, 1965, the holding period of the property begins on January 2, 1965. If he sells the property on October 1, 1966, the holding period on the day of the sale is 21 full months, and, accordingly, the applicable percentage is 99 percent. This result would not be changed even if the property initially had been used solely as the taxpayer's residence for a portion of the 21-month period. If, however, the property were sold on September 30, 1966, the holding period would be only 20 full months.
(2) For the purpose of determining the applicable percentage in the case of property constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer, the holding period of the property shall begin on the first day of the month during which the property is placed in service. See section 1250(e)(1)(B). Thus, for example, if a taxpayer constructs section 1250 property and places it in service on January 15, 1965, its holding period begins on January 1, 1965. If the taxpayer sells the property on December 31, 1966, its holding period on the day of sale is 24 full months, and, accordingly, the applicable percentage is 96 percent. For purposes of this subparagraph, property is placed in service on the date on which it is first used, whether in a
trade or business, in the production of income, or in a personal activity. Thus, for example, a residence constructed by a taxpayer for his personal use is placed in service on the date it is occupied as a residence. For purposes of determining the date property is placed in service, it is immaterial when the period begins for depreciation with respect to the property under any depreciation practice under which depreciation begins in any month other than the month in which the property is placed in service. If one or more units of a single property are placed in service on different dates before the completion of the property, see paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to treatment of each such unit as an element).
(c)
Property with transferred basis.
Under section 1250(e)(2), if the basis of property acquired in a transaction described in this subparagraph is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor, then the holding period of the property in the hands of the transferee shall include the holding period of the property in the hands of the transferor. The transactions described in this subparagraph are:
(1) A gift described in section 1250(d)(1).
(2) Certain transfers at death to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-3.
(3) Certain tax-free transactions to which section 1250(d)(3) applies. For application of section 1250 (d)(3) and (e)(2) to a distribution by a partnership to a partner, see paragraph (f)(1) of § 1.1250-3.
(4) A transfer described in paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to transaction under section 1081(d)(1)(A)).
(5) A transfer at death where the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022.
(d)
Principal residence acquired in certain transactions.
The holding period of a principal residence acquired in a transaction to which section 1034 and paragraph (g)(6) of § 1.1250-3 apply includes the holding period of the principal residence disposed of in such transaction. See section 1250(e)(3). The holding period of a principal residence acquired does not include the period beginning on the day after the date of the disposition and ending on the date of the acquisition.
(e)
Application of transferred basis and principal residence rules.
The determination of holding period under this section shall be made without regard to whether a transaction occurred prior to the effective date of section 1250 and without regard to whether there was any gain upon the transaction. Thus, for example, under paragraph (c) of this section a donee's holding period for property includes his donor's holding period notwithstanding that the gift occurred on or before December 31, 1963, or that there was no additional depreciation in respect of the property at the time of the gift.
(f)
Qualified low-income housing project acquired in certain transactions.
The holding period of a
reinvestment element
(and of subelements thereof) of section 1250 property (as defined in paragraph (h) (2) of § 1.1250-3) acquired in a transaction to which sections 1039(a) and 1250(d)(8)(A) apply includes the holding period of the corresponding element of the section 1250 property disposed of. See section 1250(e)(4). The holding period of the
additional cost element
(as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.1250-3) begins on the date the replacement project is acquired. The holding period of a
reinvestment element
of section 1250 property does not include the period beginning on the day after the date of the disposition and ending (1) on the date of the acquisition of the replacement housing project, or (2) on the date the replacement housing project constructed or reconstructed by the taxpayer is placed in service.
(g)
Cross reference.
If the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after a transaction to which paragraph (c) or (d) of this section applies exceeds its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transaction, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with two or more elements).
(h)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017,
see § 1.1250-4 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
[T.D. 7084, 36 FR 281, Jan. 8, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7400, 41 FR 5103, Feb. 4, 1976; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6241, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1250-5
Property with two or more elements.
(a)
Dispositions before January 1, 1970
—(1)
Amount treated as ordinary income.
If section 1250 property consisting of two or more elements (described in paragraph (c) of this section) is disposed of before January 1, 1970, the amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) shall be the sum, determined in three steps under subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph, of the amounts of gain for each element.
(2)
Step 1.
The first step is to make the following computations:
(i) In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)), and the gain realized. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange or involuntary conversion, the gain realized shall be considered to be the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis.
(ii) In respect of each element as if it were a separate property, compute the additional depreciation for the element, and the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250(a)(2)) for the element. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.
(3)
Step 2.
The second step is to determine the amount of gain for each element in the following manner:
(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the gain realized, then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element is the product of the additional depreciation for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage for the element.
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element is the product of:
(
a
) The additional depreciation for the element, multiplied by
(
b
) The applicable percentage for the element, and multiplied by
(
c
) A ratio, computed by dividing (
1
) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole or the gain realized, by (
2
) the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation.
(4)
Step 3.
The third step is to compute the sum of the amounts of gain for each element, as determined in step 2.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Gain of $35,000 is realized upon a sale, before January 1, 1970, of section 1250 property which consists of four elements (W, X, Y, and Z). Since on the date of the sale the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole ($24,000) is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation and is less than the gain realized, the additional depreciation for each element is determined under subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph. The amount of gain taken into account under section. 1250(a)(2) is $7,500, as determined in the following table in accordance with the additional facts assumed.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that in respect of the property as a whole the additional depreciation is $20,000 because with respect to element Y additional depreciation allowed was $4,000 less than straight line. Accordingly, the sum of the additional depreciation for each element
having additional depreciation is $24,000, that is, $4,000 greater than the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole. Thus, the additional depreciation for each element is determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph. The ratio referred to in subparagraph (3)(ii)(c) of this paragraph is twenty twenty-fourths, that is, the lower of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole ($20,000) or the gain realized ($35,000), divided by the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation ($24,000). The amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) is $6,250, as determined in the following table:

(b)
Dispositions after December 31, 1969
—(1)
Amount treated as ordinary income.
If section 1250 property consisting of two or more elements (described in paragraph (c) of this section) is disposed of after December 31, 1969, the amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a) shall be the sum, determined in 5 steps under subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this paragraph, of the amount of gain for each element. Steps 3 and 4 are used only if the gain realized exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of the property as a whole.
(2)
Step 1.
The first step is to make the following computations:
(i) In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)) attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, and the gain realized. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain realized shall be considered to be the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis.
(ii) In respect of each element as if it were a separate property, compute the additional depreciation for the element attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, and the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250(a)(1)) for the element. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.
(3)
Step 2.
The second step is to determine the amount of gain recognized for each element under section 1250(a) (1) in the following manner:
(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the gain realized, then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(1) is the product of the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1960, for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(1).
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account under section 1250(a)(1) for an element is the product of:
(
a
) The additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, for the element multiplied by
(
b
) The applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(1) for the element, and multiplied by
(
c
) A ratio, computed by dividing (
1
) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole which is attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or the gain realized, by (
2
) the sum of the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of each element having such additional depreciation.
(4)
Step (3).
If the gain realized exceeds the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods after December 31, 1969.
(i) Compute the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, and the remaining gain (or remaining potential gain in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), in respect of the property as a whole.
(ii) Compute the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, and the applicable percentage determined under section 1250(a)(2) in respect of each element as if it were a separate property. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period of an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.
(5)
Step (4).
The fourth step is to compute the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) for each element (if computation was required under step (3)) in the following manner:
(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the remaining gain (or remaining potential gain), then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(2) is the product of the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage determined under section 1250(a)(2) for the element.
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(2) is the product of:
(
a
) The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, for the element, multiplied by,
(
b
) The applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(2), and multiplied by,
(
c
) A ratio, computed by dividing (
1
) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole which is attributable to periods before January 1, 1970,
or the remaining gain (or remaining potential gain), by (
2
) the sum of the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, in respect of each element having additional depreciation.
(6)
Step (5).
The fifth step is to compute the sum of the amount of gain for each element, as determined in steps (2) and (4).
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Gain of $60,000 is realized upon a sale, after the December 31, 1969, of section 1250 property which was constructed by the taxpayer after such date. The property consists of four elements (W, X, Y, and Z). Since on the date of sale the amount of additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of the property as a whole ($32,000), is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation and is less than the gain realized, the gain recognized for each element is determined under subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph. The amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(1) is $28,500, as determined in the following table in accordance with the additional facts assumed:

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the property was acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 1970. Since the gain realized ($60,000) exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($32,000), section 1250(a)(2) applies to the remaining gain of $28,000. Since the additional depreciation
in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($21,000), is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation and is less than the remaining gain ($28,000), the amount of gain recognized for each element under section 1250(a)(2) is determined under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph. The amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(1) is $28,500 the same as in example (1). The amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) is $3,900, as determined in the following table in accordance with the additional facts assumed:

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in example (2) except that element Y has a deficit in additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, of $6,000 and thus the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of the property as a whole is $24,000. The sum of the additional depreciation for each element having additional depreciation is $30,000, or $6,000 more than the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole. Thus, the gain recognized for each element under section 1250(a)(1) is determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph. The ratio referred to in subparagraph (3)(ii) (
c
) of this paragraph is 24:30, that is, the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($24,000), or the gain realized ($60,000), divided by the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation ($30,000). The amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(1) is $21,280, as determined in the following table:

(ii) In addition, gain is recognized under section 1250(a)(2) since there is a remaining potential gain of $36,000, that is, gain realized ($60,000) minus the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969 ($24,000). The gain recognized in respect of each element and the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) ($3,900) are the same as in example (2), since the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970 ($21,000) is less than the remaining gain ($36,000).
(c)
Element
—(1)
General.
For purposes of this section, in the case of section 1250 property there shall be treated as separate elements the separate improvements, units, remaining property, special elements, and low-income housing elements which are respectively referred to in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.
(2)
Separate improvements.
There shall be treated as an element each
separate improvement
(as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) to the property.
(3)
Units.
If before completion of section 1250 property one or more units thereof are placed in service, each such unit of the section 1250 property shall be treated as an element.
(4)
Remaining property.
The remaining property which is not taken into account under subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph shall be treated as an element.
(5)
Special elements.
(i) If the basis of section 1250 property is reduced in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to property acquired from a decedent prior to his death) or in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to basis reduction under section 1071 or 1082(a)(2)), then such property shall be considered as having a special element with additional depreciation equal to the amount of additional depreciation included in the depreciation adjustments (referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1250-2) to which the basis reduction is attributable. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period of a special element under this subdivision shall be determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (e)(3)(iii) (whichever is applicable) of § 1.1250-3.
(ii) If a disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) of a portion of an item of property gives rise to an addition to capital account (described in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section)
which is not a separate improvement, then such property shall be considered as having a special element with additional depreciation and, for purposes of computing applicable percentage, a holding period determined under paragraph (d)(7) of § 1.1250-3.
(6)
Low-income housing elements.
If, in an approved disposition of a qualified housing project, a replacement qualified housing project is treated as consisting of more than one element of section 1250 property by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(E) (see paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.1250-3), the elements determined under such section shall be treated as elements for purposes of this section. For definition of the terms
qualified housing project
and
approved disposition,
see section 1039(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer constructs an apartment house which he places in service in three stages. The total cost is $1 million, of which $350,000 is allocable to the first stage, $500,000 to the second stage, and $150,000 to the third stage. The first stage, which is placed in service on January 1, 1965, consists of 300 apartments and certain facilities including a central heating system and a common lobby. The second stage, which is placed in service on July 15, 1965, consists of 550 apartments and certain facilities including the motor for a central air-conditioning system. The third stage, which is placed in service on January 19, 1966, consists of the residue of the apartment house. On December 31, 1968, the taxpayer disposes of the apartment house. On such date, the apartment house has three elements which are described in the table below:

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that on January 1, 1969, two new floors, which were added after the apartment house was completed, are placed in service and that on July 1, 1972, the taxpayer disposes of the building. Assume further that the two new floors are one separate improvement (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section). On the date disposed of, the property consists of four elements, that is, the three elements described in example (1) and the separate improvement.
(d)
Separate improvement
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, with respect to any section 1250 property, the term
separate improvement
means an
addition to capital account
described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which qualifies as an
improvement
under the 1-year test prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and which satisfies the 36-month test prescribed in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Addition to capital account.
(i) In the case of any section 1250 property, an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph is any addition to capital account in respect of such property after its initial acquisition or completion by the taxpayer or by any person who held the property during a period included in the taxpayer's holding period (see § 1.1250-4) for the property. An addition to the capital account of section 1250 property may arise, for example, if there is an expenditure for section 1250 property which is an improvement, replacement, addition, or alteration to such property (regardless of whether the cost thereof is capitalized or charged against the depreciation reserve). In such a case, the
addition to capital account
is the gross addition, unreduced by amounts attributable to replaced property, to the net capital account and not the net addition to such account. Thus, if a roof has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and is replaced by constructing a new roof at a cost of $50,000, the gross addition of $50,000 is an addition to capital account. (The adjusted basis of the old roof is no longer included in the capital account for the property.) For purposes of this section, the status of an addition to capital account is not affected by whether or not it is treated as a separate property for purposes of determining depreciation adjustments. In case of an addition to the capital account of property arising after December 31, 1963, upon a disposition referred to in section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) of a portion of an item of such property, the amount of such addition (and its basis for all purposes of the Code) shall be the basis thereof determined under paragraph (d) (2), (3), or
(4) (whichever is applicable) of § 1.1250-3, applied by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties.
(ii) An addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of section 1250 property in the hands of a transferee immediately after a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(2) (relating to holding period of property with transferred basis) over its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transaction. Thus, for example, such excess may arise from a gift which is in part a sale or exchange (see paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1250-3), from an increase in basis due to gift tax paid (see section 1015(d)), from a transfer referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to certain tax-free transactions) in which gain is partially recognized, or from a distribution by a partnership to a partner in which no gain is recognized by reason of the application of section 731. Similarly, an addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of a principal residence acquired in a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(3) over the adjusted basis of the principal residence disposed of, as well as to any increase in the adjusted basis of section 1250 property of a partnership by reason of an optional basis adjustment under section 734(b) or 743(b).
(iii) Whether or not an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph, as distinguished from a separate item of property, may depend on how the property or properties are disposed of. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer, who owns a motel consisting of 10 buildings with common heating and plumbing systems, adds to the motel three new buildings which are connected to the common systems, and if the taxpayer sells the motel to one person in one transaction, then for purposes of this subparagraph the cost of the three new buildings shall be treated as an addition to the capital account of the motel and, if the 1-year and 36-month tests of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph are satisfied, the motel consists of at least two elements. If, however, the 10-building group and the three-building group were individually sold in separate transactions to two different people each of whom would operate his group as a separate business, the motel would consist of two items of property.
(3)
One-year test for improvement.
(i) An addition to capital account of section 1250 property for any taxable year (including a short taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition occurs) shall be treated as an improvement only if the sum of all additions to the capital account of such property for such taxable year exceeds the greater of:
(
a
) $2,000, or
(
b
) One percent of the unadjusted basis of the property, determined as of the beginning (
1
) of such taxable year, or (
2
) of the holding period (within the meaning of § 1.1250-4) of the property, whichever is the later.
(ii) For purposes of this section, the term
unadjusted basis
means the adjusted basis of the property, determined without regard to the adjustments provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3) (relating to adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and depletion). For purposes of this paragraph, as of any particular date the unadjusted basis of section 1250 property (
a
) includes the cost of any addition to capital account for the property which arises prior to such date (regardless of whether such addition qualified under this subparagraph as an improvement), and (
b
) does not include the cost of a component retired before such date.
(iii) In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250 property by a person:
(
a
) There shall not be taken into account under the 1-year test for improvements in this subparagraph any addition to capital account which arises by reason of (or after) such disposition or which arises before the beginning of the holding period under § 1.1250-4 of such person for the property, and
(
b
) Such test shall be made in respect of each taxable year of such person (and of any prior transferor) any day of which is included under § 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except that (
1
) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such person only if such person actually owned
the property on at least 1 day of such taxable year, and (
2
) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such taxable year.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The unadjusted basis of section 1250 property as of the beginning of January 1, 1960, is $300,000. During the taxable year ending on December 31, 1960, the only additions to the capital account for the property are addition A on January 1, 1960, costing $1,000, and addition B on July 1, 1960, costing $600. Since the sum of the amounts added to capital account for such taxable year is less than $2,000, A and B are not treated as improvements. This result would not be changed if addition C, costing $600, were added on December 15, 1960, since although the sum of the additions ($1,000 plus $600 plus $600, or $2,200) exceeds $2,000, such sum is less than 1 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property as of the beginning of 1960 ($3,000, that is, 1 percent of $300,000). If however, C cost $1,500, then A, B, and C would each be considered an improvement since the sum of the amounts added to capital account $3,100) would exceed $3,000.

# Example 2.
Green and his son both use the calendar year as the taxable year. On February 1, 1965, Green makes addition A to a piece of section 1250 property. On June 15, 1965, Green transfers such property to his son as a gift which is in part a sale (see paragraph (a) of § 1.1250-3). Addition B arises by reason of the transfer. On August 1, 1965, the son makes addition C to the property. For purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) to Green upon the transfer, the determination of whether addition A is an improvement is made without taking into account additions B and C. For purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) upon a subsequent disposition of the property by the son, additions B and C would be taken into account in the determination of whether A is an improvement, and A would be taken into account in the determination of whether B and C are improvements.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2). Assume further that on September 15, 1965, the son transfers the property to a corporation in exchange for cash and stock in the corporation in a transaction qualifying under section 351 (see paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-3), and that the corporation uses a fiscal year ending November 30. For purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) upon a subsequent disposition by the corporation, the one-year test under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is made for the entire taxable year of Green and of the son ending on December 31, 1965, and in respect of the corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1965. Accordingly, if on December 7, 1965, addition D is made by the corporation, then, upon a subsequent disposition by the corporation, D is taken into account for purposes of the determination in respect of the entire taxable year of Green and of the son ending on December 31, 1965, and for the corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1966, but not for purposes of the corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1965. If D were made on January 3, 1966, D would still be taken into account for purposes of the determination in respect of the corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1966. However, since neither Green nor his son actually owned the property on any day of the taxable year ending December 31, 1966, no determination is made in respect of such taxable year of Green or of the son.
(4)
36-month test for separate improvement.
(i) If, during the 36-month period ending on the last day of any taxable year (including a short taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition occurs), the sum of the amounts treated under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as improvements for such period exceeds the greatest of:
(
a
) 25 percent of the adjusted basis of the property,
(
b
) 10 percent of the unadjusted basis (determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph) of the property, or
(
c
) $5,000,
Then each such improvement during such period shall be treated as a separate improvement, and thus as an element. For purposes of (
a
) and (
b
) of this subdivision, the adjusted basis (or unadjusted basis) of section 1250 property shall be determined as of the beginning of the 36-month period, or as of the beginning of the holding period of the property (within the meaning of § 1.1250-4), whichever is the later.
(ii) In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250 property by a person:
(
a
) There shall not be taken into account under the 36-month test for separate improvements in this subparagraph any amount treated under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as an improvement which arises by reason of (or after) the disposition or which
arises before the beginning of the holding period under § 1.1250-4 of such person for the property, and
(
b
) Such test shall be made in respect of each 36-month period ending on the last day of each taxable year of such person (and of any prior transferor) if at least 1 day of such period is included under § 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except that (
1
) such test shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the last day of a taxable year of such person only if such person actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such period, and (
2
) such test shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the last day of a taxable year of such prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such period.
(iii) For illustration of the principles of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, see examples (2) and (3) in subparagraph (3)(iv) of this paragraph.
(5)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(i) On December 31, 1967, X, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases an item of section 1250 property at a cost of $100,000. In the table below, the adjusted basis and unadjusted basis of the property are shown for the beginning of January 1 of each taxable year and it is assumed that each addition to capital was added on January 1 of the year shown.
Year
Adjusted basis
Unadjusted basis

$94,000
$100,000
$1,000

1970
97,030
110,000

120,000
1,200
1973
86,158
120,000
1,200
D-18,000
(ii) Since each addition to capital account for the property exceeds the greater of $2,000 or one percent of unadjusted basis, determined as of the beginning of the taxable year in which made, each addition to capital account qualifies as an improvement under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(iii) Since the beginning of the holding period of the property under § 1.1250-4 (Jan. 1, 1968) is later than the beginning of the 36-month period ending on December 31, 1969, the determination as to whether there are any separate improvements on the property as of December 31, 1969, is made by examining the adjusted basis (or unadjusted basis) of the property as of the beginning of January 1, 1968. As of December 31, 1969, there were no separate improvements on the property since the only amount treated as an improvement for the period beginning on January 1, 1968, and ending on December 31, 1969, in addition A (costing $10,000), which is less than $25,000, that is, 25 percent of the adjusted basis ($100,000) of the property as of the beginning of January 1, 1968.
(iv) As of December 31, 1970, there were no separate improvements on the property since the sum of the amounts treated as improvements for the 36-month period ending on December 31, 1970, is $14,000 (that is, $10,000 for A, plus $4,000 for B), and this sum is less than $25,000, that is, 25 percent of the adjusted basis ($100,000) of the property as of the beginning of January 1, 1968.
(v) As of December 31, 1971, there were no separate improvements on the property since the sum of the amounts treated as improvements for the 36-month period ending on December 31, 1971, is $20,000 (that is, $10,000 for A, plus $4,000 for B, plus $6,000 for C), and this sum is less than $23,500, that is, 25 percent of the adjusted basis ($94,000) of the property as of the beginning of January 1, 1969.
(vi) As of December 31, 1972, there were no separate improvements on the property since the sum of the amounts treated as improvements for the 36-month period ending on December 31, 1972, is $10,000 (that is, $4,000 for B plus $6,000 for C), and this sum is less than $24,258 that is, 25 percent of the adjusted basis ($97,030) of the property as of the beginning of January 1, 1970.
(vii) As of December 31, 1973, C and D are separate improvements (notwithstanding that as of December 31, 1971 and 1972, C was not a separate improvement) since the sum of the amounts added for the 36-month period ending December 31, 1973, is $24,000 (that is, $6,000 for C plus $18,000 for D), and this sum exceeds the greatest of:
(
a
) $23,510, that is, 25 percent of the adjusted basis ($94,041) of the section 1250 property as of the beginning of January 1, 1971,
(
b
) $11,400, that is, 10 percent of the unadjusted basis ($114,000) of the property as of the beginning of such first day, or
(
c
) $5,000.
(e)
Additional depreciation and holding period of property acquired in certain transactions
—(1)
Transferred basis.
If property consisting of two or more elements is disposed of, and if the holding period of the property in the hands of the transferee for purposes of computing applicable percentage includes the holding period of the transferor by reason of the application of paragraph (c) (other than subparagraph (2) thereof) of § 1.1250-4, then the additional depreciation for each element of the
property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer shall be computed in the manner set forth in this subparagraph. First, any element having a deficit in additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor immediately before such transfer shall be considered to have the same deficit in the hands of the transferee. Second, elements having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer shall be considered to have additional depreciation in the hands of the transferee. The sum of the transferee's additional depreciation for all elements of the property having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor shall be an amount equal to the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole immediately after the transfer increased by the sum of the deficits in addition depreciation for all elements having such deficits. In case there is more than one element having additional depreciation, the additional depreciation for any such element in the hands of the transferee shall be computed by multiplying (i) the amount computed under the preceding sentence by (ii) the additional depreciation for such element in the hands of the transferor divided by the sum of the additional depreciation for all such elements having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period for an element of such property in the hands of the transferee shall include the holding period of such element in the hands of the transferor.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Section 1250 property has additional depreciation of $16,000 of which $12,000 is additional depreciation for element X and $4,000 for element Y. The property is transferred to a corporation in exchange for cash of $6,000 and for stock in the corporation. Assume that recognition of gain under section 1250(a) is limited to $6,000 (the amount of cash received) by reason of the application of section 351(b) (relating to transfer to corporation controlled by transferor) and section 1250(d)(3) (relating to limitation on application of section 1250 in certain tax-free transactions). Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of § 1.1250-3, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the corporation immediately after the transfer is $10,000, that is, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer ($16,000) minus the gain under section 1250(a) recognized upon the transfer ($6,000). Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in the hands of the corporation immediately after the transfer element X has additional depreciation of $7,500 (
12/16
of $10,000) and element Y as additional depreciation of $2,500 (
4/16
of $10,000). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section there is an addition of $6,000 to the capital account for the property.
(3)
Principal residence.
If a principal residence consisting of two or more elements is disposed of, and if for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period of the principal residence acquired includes the holding period of the principal residence disposed of by reason of the application of paragraph (d) of § 1.1250-4, then the additional depreciation (or a deficit in additional depreciation) for an element of the principal residence acquired immediately after the transaction shall be determined in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period for an element of the principal residence acquired includes the holding period of such element of the principal residence disposed of, but not the period beginning on the day after the date of the disposition and ending on the date of the acquisition.
(f)
Holding period for small separate improvements
—(1)
General.
This paragraph prescribes a special holding period solely for the purpose of computing the applicable percentage of a separate improvement (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) which is treated as an element. See paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for determination of holding period under section 1223 for purposes of computing additional depreciation. In respect of section 1250 property, if the amount of a separate improvement does not exceed the greater of:
(i) $2,000, or
(ii) One percent of the unadjusted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) of such property, determined as of the beginning of the taxable year in which such separate improvement was made,
Then such separate improvement shall be treated for purposes of computing applicable percentage as placed in service on the first day, of a calendar month, which is the closest such first day to the middle of the taxable year. See the last sentence of section 1250(f)(4)(B). If two such first days are equally close to the middle of the taxable year, the earliest of such days is the applicable day.
(2)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(i) The unadjusted basis of section 1250 property as of the beginning of January 1, 1960, is $100,000. During the taxable year ending on December 31, 1960, the only additions to the capital account for the property are addition A on March 10, 1960, costing $1,200 and addition B on September 16, 1960, costing $1,400. Since the sum of the additions ($2,600) exceeds the greater of $2,000 and 1 percent of unadjusted basis ($1,000, that is, 1 percent of $100,000), each addition is an improvement under the 1-year test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Assume that the 36-month test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section is satisfied and, therefore, each addition is a separate improvement treated as an element.
(ii) Since each element is less than $2,000, the provisions of this paragraph apply. Since there are 366 days in 1960, the middle of the year is at the end of 183 days, or July 1. Thus, that first day of a calendar month in 1960, which is the closest first day (of a calendar month) to the middle of the taxable year, is July 1, 1960. Accordingly, for purposes of computing applicable percentage, elements A and B are each treated as placed in service on July 1, 1960.
[T.D. 7084, 36 FR 275, Jan. 8, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7193, 37 FR 12957, June 30, 1972; T.D. 7400, 41 FR 5103, Feb. 4, 1976]
§ 1.1251-1
General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of property used in farming where farm losses offset nonfarm income.
(a)
Applicability.
The provisions of section 1251, this section, and §§ 1.1251-2 through 1.1251-4 shall apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, but only if (1) there is a farm net loss (as defined in section 1251(e)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-3) for the taxable year, or (2) there is a balance in the excess deductions account (as described in § 1251-2) as of the close of the taxable year before subtracting any amount under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of § 1251-2. See section 1251(a). In general, a taxpayer who has a farm net loss and certain other taxpayers are required to establish and maintain an excess deductions account as provided in section 1251(b). Certain additions and subtractions are made to the excess deductions account, and upon the disposition of
farm recapture property
any gain to the extent of the balance in the excess deductions account is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). See paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
Farm recapture property
is, in general, certain farming property (other than section 1250 property) described in paragraph (1), (3), or (4) of section 1231(b). See paragraph (a) of § 1.1251-3.
(b)
Ordinary income
—(1)
General rule.
In general, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph, upon a disposition of an item of farm recapture property during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of which:
(i) In the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the amount realized, or
(ii) In the case of any other disposition, the fair market value of such property
exceeds the adjusted basis of such property shall be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) shall be determined separately for each item of farm recapture property in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraphs (4) and (5) of § 1.1245-1(a) (relating to gain from dispositions of certain depreciable property). Generally, such ordinary income treatment applies even though in the absence of section 1251(c)(1) no gain would be recognized under the Code. For example, if a corporation distributes farm recapture property as a dividend gain may be recognized as ordinary income to the corporation even though, in the absence of section 1251(c)(1), section 311(a) would preclude any recognition of gain to the
corporation. For purposes of section 1251, the term
disposition
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1245-1. For the relation of section 1251 to other provisions of the Code, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Limitation as to dispositions of land
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a disposition of land, gain shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) only to the extent of the land's
potential gain.
See section 1251(c)(2)(C).
(ii)
Potential gain.
For purposes of section 1251, the term
potential gain
means in respect of land an amount equal to the excess of its fair market value over its adjusted basis, but limited to the extent of the deductions allowable in respect to such land pursuant to an election (if any) under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation expenditures) and 182 (relating to expenditures by farmers for clearing land) for the taxable year of disposition and the four immediately preceding taxable years regardless of whether any such preceding taxable year begins before December 31, 1969. See section (e)(5).
(iii)
Cross reference.
For additional recapture of certain deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of farm land, see section 1252.
(3)
Exceptions and special rules.
The amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) after applying subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if applicable, shall be subject to the exceptions and special rules of section 1251(d) and § 1.1251-4.
(4)
Limitation as to amount in excess deductions account
—(i)
In general.
The aggregate of the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (after applying subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if applicable) shall not exceed the amount in the excess deductions account at the close of the taxable year after subtracting from the account the amount specified in section 1251(b)(3)(A) and paragraph (c)(1)(i) of § 1.1251-2. See section 1251(c)(2)(A). For transfer of amount in an excess deductions account, see section 1251(b)(5).
(ii)
Dispositions taken into account.
If the aggregate of the amount to which section 1251(c)(1) applies is limited for any taxable year by the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, section 1251(c)(1) shall apply in respect of dispositions of items of farm recapture property in the order made. See section 1251(c)(2)(B).
(5)
Relationship to section 1245.
If property is disposed of which qualifies as both section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) as well as farm recapture property, then gain shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) only to the extent that the amount of any gain realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), or to the extent that the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis (in the case of any other disposition), was not recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property (i) is taken into account under paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1251-3 for purposes of computing farm net loss (or farm net income) and (ii) is not under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of § 1.1251-2 subtracted from the excess deductions account.
(6)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, makes one disposition of farm recapture property during 1970. On June 30, 1970, he sells for $75,000 farm recapture property (other than land) with an adjusted basis of $43,000 for a realized gain of $32,000 none of which is recognized under section 1245. The balance in A's excess deductions account is $39,000 at the close of 1970 (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)). Hence, the entire gain of $32,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), and the balance remaining in A's excess deductions account is $7,000. If, however, the original balance in the excess deductions account were only $15,000, then only $15,000 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) and A's excess deductions account balance would be reduced to zero. The remaining gain of $17,000 may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.

# Example 2.
M, a calendar year corporation makes one disposition of farm recapture property during 1975. On January 15, 1975, M distributes as a dividend to its shareholders land which it had acquired on March 3, 1970.
On that date, the excess of the fair market value ($67,500) over the adjusted basis of land ($45,000) is $22,500 and the sum of the deductions allowable in respect of such land under sections 175 and 182 is $5,000 for 1970 and $13,000 for the taxable year of disposition and the four immediately preceding taxable years. Thus, the potential gain (as defined in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) is limited to $13,000. At the end of M's taxable year (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A) there is a balance of $25,000 in the excess deductions account of M. Since such balance exceeds the potential gain, M recognizes $13,000 as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) even though, in the absence of that provision, section 311(a) would preclude recognition of gain to M. The balance in M's excess deductions account is reduced by $13,000, from $25,000 to $12,000. With respect to the treatment of the remaining gain ($9,500) from the disposition of the land, see section 1252 and example (2) of paragraph (e) § 1.1252-1.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that M makes a second disposition of farm recapture property during 1975. On June 5, 1975. M sells for $55,000 a breeding herd of cattle having an adjusted basis of $35,000 for a realized gain of $20,000. M had acquired the herd on April 1, 1971. Assume further that $6,000 of the $20,000 gain realized is treated as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). Thus, the amount of gain M would recognize as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), computed before applying the excess deductions account limitation, is $14,000. In accordance with the computation in example (1) of paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1251-2, the excess deductions account limitations limit the maximum amount of gain which can be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) upon the disposition of the land and the breeding herd to $25,000. Under subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of such limitation, $25,000, is assigned to each property in the order of disposition. Thus, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251 is $13,000 (as in example (1) of this subparagraph) on the disposition of the land and $12,000 on the disposition of the breeding herd. The remaining gain of $2,000 (i.e., $14,000 minus $12,000) on the disposition of the breeding herd may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.
(c)
Instances of nonapplication
—(1)
In general.
Section 1251 does not apply with respect to dispositions of farm recapture property by a taxpayer during a taxable year if at the close of such year after making the necessary additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A), there is no balance in the taxpayer's excess deductions account.
(2)
Losses.
Section 1251(c)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1251(c)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is farm recapture property, nor does the section apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(3)
Certain dispositions of interests in land.
Section 1251(c)(1) does not apply to dispositions of interests in land with respect to which no deductions were allowable pursuant to an election under section 175 (relating to soil and water conservation expenditures) and 182 (relating to expenditures by farmers for clearing land) for the taxable year of disposition and the four immediately preceding taxable years. For possible application of section 1252 in such a case, see example (1) of paragraph (e) of § 1.1252-1.
(d)
Partnerships.
[Reserved]
(e)
Relation of section 1251 to other provisions
—(1)
General.
The provisions of section 1251 apply (after applying paragraph (b)(5) of this section, relating to section 1245 property) notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or special rule under section 1251(d) and § 1.1251-4 applies, gain under section 1251(c)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, section 1251 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in a trade or business). Accordingly, gain recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the balance in the taxpayer's excess deductions account, and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (3) of paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(2)
Nonrecognition sections overridden.
The nonrecognition of gain provisions of subtitle A of the Code which section
1251 overrides include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, and 512(b)(5). See section 1251(d) and § 1.1251-4 for the extent to which 1251(c)(1) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721, 1031, and 1033.
(3)
Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1251(c)(1).
For treatment of gain not recognized under section 1251(c)(1), the principles of paragraph (f) § 1.1251-6 shall be applicable. Thus section 1251 does not prevent gain which is not recognized under section 1251 from being considered as gain under another provision of the Code, such as for example, section 1252(a)(1) (relating to treatment of gain from disposition of farm land). See example (1) of paragraph (e) of § 1.1252-1.
(4)
Exempt income.
With regard to exempt income, the principles of paragraph (e) of § 1.1245-6 shall be applicable.
(5)
Normal retirement of asset in multiple asset account.
Section 1251(c)(1) does not require recognition of gain upon normal retirements of farm recapture property in a multiple asset account as long as the taxpayer's method of accounting, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.167(a)-8 (relating to accounting treatment of asset retirements), does not require recognition of such gain.
(6)
Installment method
—(i)
In general.
Gain from a disposition to which section 1251(c)(1) applies may be reported under the installment method if such method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such case, the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1251(c)(1) applies until all such gain has been reported, and the remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1251(c)(1) does not apply. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483. For adjustments in the excess deductions account, see paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of § 1.1251-2.
(ii)
Special rule.
If a taxpayer disposes of property used in the trade or business of farming which qualifies as both section 1245 property as well as farm recapture property and elects to report the gain from such disposition under the installment method, then the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall (
a
) first be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1245(a)(1) applies until all such gain has been reported, (
b
) The remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1251(e)(1) applies until all such gain has been reported, and (
c
) finally the remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which neither section 1245(a)(1) nor 1251 (c)(1) applies. See paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.1252-1 with respect to the installment method in regard to the disposition of property which is both farm recapture property as well as farm land (as defined in section 1252(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(3)(i) of § 1.1252-1).

§ 1.1251-2
Excess deductions account.
(a)
Establishment and maintenance of account
—(1)
General rule.
With respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, any taxpayer who:
(i) Has a farm net loss (as defined in section 1251(e)(2) and in paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-3) for such a taxable year, or
(ii) Has an excess deductions account balance as of the close of such a taxable year
shall establish (if not previously established) and maintain for purposes of section 1251 an excess deductions account. See section 1251(b)(1). Once an excess deductions account is established (or succeeded to under paragraph (e) of this section in the case of certain corporate transactions and gifts) all entries (including the entries prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section with respect to married taxpayers who file joint returns) with respect to the account must be part of the taxpayer's permanent records for all taxable years for which the account must be maintained. For purposes of applying section 1251 and this section, the term
taxpayer
in the case of a partnership means each partner of such partnership and in the case of an estate or trust means the estate or trust regardless of whether it is taxable under subpart A or E, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Distributions from estate or trust.
If farm recapture property is distributed from an estate or trust in a transaction to which section 1251(d) (1) or (2) (relating to exceptions for gifts and transfers at death) applies, then the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust shall be succeeded to by the distributee in the amount, if any, and manner prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence only, the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be applied by treating each distribution as a gift at the time made. Thus; for example, if all of the farm recapture property of an estate or trust is distributed to a distributee on the date the estate or trust terminates, the distributee will succeed on that date to the excess deductions account balance of the estate or trust.
(3)
Exception.
A taxpayer is not required to maintain an excess deductions account under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for a taxable year if:
(i) For such taxable year there would be no additions to the taxpayer's excess deductions account, and
(ii) For the immediately preceding taxable year the balance in the taxpayer's excess deductions account was reduced to zero by reason of section 1251 (b)(3) (relating to subtractions from the account) or section 1251(b)(5) (relating to transfer of account).
(b)
Additions to account
—(1)
General rule.
For each taxable year, there shall be added to the excess deductions account an amount equal to the taxpayer's farm net loss. See section 1251(b)(2)(A).
(2)
Exceptions.
In the case of an individual and, in the case of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply for a taxable year:
(i) Only if the taxpayer's nonfarm adjusted gross income (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 1.1251-3) for such year exceeds $50,000, and
(ii) Only to the extent the taxpayer's farm net loss for such year exceeds $25,000.
The limitations of this subparagraph apply to a person (other than a trust) to whom the tax rates set forth in section 1 are applicable and as prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph in respect of an electing small business corporation.
(3)
Electing small business corporation
—(i)
Taxable years ending before December 11, 1971.
For taxable years ending before December 11, 1971, in the case of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b):
(
a
) For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the term
the taxpayer
means such corporation or any one of its shareholders, and the term
such year,
in the case of a shareholder, means his taxable year with which or within which the taxable year of the corporation ends (see paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1251-3 for special rules relating to the computation of nonfarm adjusted gross income of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation), and
(
b
) The limitations in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall not apply to the corporation for a taxable year if on any day of such year there is a taxpayer who is a shareholder having, for his taxable year with which or within which the taxable year of such corporation ends, a farm net loss (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-3).
For purposes of determining whether a shareholder of such corporation has a farm net loss, there shall not be taken into account his pro rata share of farm net income or loss of any other electing small business corporation for such corporation's taxable year ending with or within his taxable year.
(
c
) The provisions of this subdivision (i) do not apply for purposes of determining whether the shareholder must make an addition to his excess deductions account and the amount of such addition.
(ii)
Taxable years ending after December 10, 1971.
[Reserved]
(4)
Married individuals
—(i)
Lower limitations for separate returns.
If married taxpayers file separate returns, then for purposes of this paragraph each spouse shall be treated as a separate individual. However, in such case, (
a
) the amount specified in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph shall be $25,000 in lieu of $50,000, and (
b
) the amount specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph shall be $12,500 in lieu of $25,000. The lower limitations in the
preceding sentence shall not apply if the spouse of the taxpayer does not have any nonfarm adjusted gross income for the taxable year. See section 1251(b)(2)(C).
(ii)
Joint return.
If married taxpayers for a taxable year file a joint return under section 6013, then for purposes of this paragraph they shall for such taxable year be treated as a single taxpayer. For rules applicable to establishing, maintaining, and allocating a joint excess deductions account, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For 1971, the M Corporation which uses the claendar year as its taxable year and which is not an electing small business corporation has a farm net loss of $40,000 and nonfarm taxable income of $45,000. Since subparagraph (2) of this paragraph does not apply to M, it is required to make a $40,000 addition to its excess deductions account.

# Example 2.
For 1971, A, an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, has a farm net loss of $33,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $65,000. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, A is required to make an addition of $8,000 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of the farm net loss, $33,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph). If, however, A were a trust, the limitation in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph would not apply and such trust would be required to add $33,000 (the amount of the entire farm net loss) to its excess deductions account.

# Example 3.
H and W each use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1971, H, a married taxpayer who files a separate return, has a farm net loss of $45,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $60,000. H's spouse W does not have any nonfarm adjusted gross income for 1971. Thus, the lower limitations in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph do not apply. Accordingly, H is required to make an addition of $20,000 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of the farm net loss, $45,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph).

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that for 1971 W has a farm net loss of $10,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $30,000. Thus, the lower limitations in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph do apply and H is required to make an addition of $32,500 to his excess deductions account (that is, the excess of his farm net loss, $45,000, over the $12,500 amount referred to in subparagraph (4)(i)(
b
) of this paragraph). Since, however, W did not have a farm net loss in excess of $12,500, she would not be required to make an addition to her excess deductions account. For the result if H and W were to file a joint return, see example (1) of paragraph (f)(6) of this section.

# Example 5.
For 1970, the M Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which is an electing small business corporation, has a farm net loss of $35,000 and nonfarm adjusted gross income of $60,000. A, B, and C, the sole equal shareholders of M, are cash method taxpayers and each uses a fiscal year ending on March 31. For the taxable year ending March 31, 1971, A has a farm net loss of $5,000. Thus, as M's taxable year ends within the taxable year of A during which A has a farm net loss, the limitations in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph do not apply with respect to M for 1970. See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, to add $35,000 to its excess deductions account.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example (5), except that A's farm net loss occurred in his fiscal year ending March 31, 1970, and no shareholder of M has a farm net loss for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1971. Thus, the limitations in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph do apply with respect to M for 1970, and accordingly M is required to add $10,000 to its excess deductions account for 1970 (that is, the excess of M's farm net loss $35,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph).

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in example (6), except that M has $45,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income for 1970 and A, for his taxable year ending March 31, 1971, has $40,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income, computed without regard to his interest in M. Assume the M paid no dividends. Since, under paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1251-3, A's income from M under section 1373(b) is computed on the basis of M's nonfarm adjusted gross income, A's gross income from M is $15,000 (
1/3
of $45,000), and A's total nonfarm adjusted gross income is $55,000. Accordingly, M would be required to add $10,000 to its excess deductions account for 1970 for the reasons stated in example (6).

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in example (7). Assume further that A is one of two equal shareholders in N, another electing small business corporation with a taxable year ending on January 31, and that N for its taxable year ending on January 31, 1971, has a $42,000 nonfarm loss and farm net income of $23,000. Assume that N paid no dividends. Thus, A for purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, would only have a total of $34,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($55,000) computed per example (7) minus $21,000 (A's share of N's nonfarm net operating loss (
1/2
of $42,000) computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1251-3)). Assuming that no other shareholder of M
has nonfarm adjusted gross income in excess of $50,000, by reason of the $50,000 limitation in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, M makes no addition for 1971 to its excess deductions account. (N would make no addition to its excess deductions account as it does not have a farm net loss.) If, however, N were to have a nonfarm loss of only $8,000, A for purposes of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph would have a total of $51,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($51,000 of nonfarm adjusted gross income ($55,000, minus
1/2
of N's nonfarm loss of $8,000)). Hence, with respect to M the result would be the same as in example (7) (and N would make no addition to its excess deductions account since it does not have a farm net loss).

# Example 9.
D and E are equal individual shareholders in corporations X, Y, and Z, the stock of each corporation having recently been purchased from a different unrelated person. X, Y, and Z are electing small business corporations. D, E, and the corporations all use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1970, the farm net income of D and E (determined without regard to their respective pro rata shares of the farm net income or loss of X, Y, and Z) are $100,000 and zero, respectively. For 1970, the farm net income or loss of the corporations are losses of $80,000 and $20,000 for X and Z, respectively, and income of $60,000 for Y. For 1970, the determinations under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph as to whether a shareholder of corporation X or Z (no determination is necessary with respect to Y since Y does not have a farm net loss) has a farm net loss are made as follows:
Determinations as to whether D or E has a farm net loss

Accordingly, since the determination as to X indicates that neither D nor E has a farm net loss, the limitations of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph apply to X. Thus, assuming that X, D, or E has nonfarm adjusted gross income in excess of $50,000, X will add $55,000 to its excess deductions account, i.e., the excess of the farm net loss, $80,000, over the $25,000 amount referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph. Since, however, the determination as to Z indicates that E has a farm net loss, such limitations do not apply to Z. Thus, the addition for 1970 to Z's excess deductions account is the entire amount of its farm net loss, $20,000.
(c)
Subtractions from account
—(1)
General rule.
Under section 1251(b)(3), if there is any amount in the excess deductions account at the close of a taxable year (determined after making any addition required under paragraph (b) of this section for such year but before making any reduction under this paragraph for such year), then the excess deductions account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by subtracting:
(i) An amount equal to (
a
) the farm net income (as defined in section 1251 (e)(3) and in paragraph (c) of § 1.1251-3) for such year, plus (
b
) the amount (as determined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) necessary to adjust the account for deductions for any taxable year which did not result in a reduction of the taxpayer's tax under subtitle A of the Code for such taxable year or any preceding taxable year, and
(ii) After making any addition to the excess deductions account under paragraph (b) of this section and any reduction under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for the taxable year, an amount equal to the sum of the amounts recognized as ordinary income solely by reason of the application of section 1251(c)(1). See section 1251(b)(3)(B). Thus, no amount shall be subtracted under this subdivision for gain recognized by reason of the application of section 1245(a)(1) or 1252(a)(1). For effect on computation of farm net loss or income of gain recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm recapture property, see paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1251-3. In the case of an installment sale of farm recapture property, the taxpayer's excess deductions account shall be reduced under this
subdivision in the year of such sale by an amount equal to the gain (computed in the year of sale) to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that there is no subtraction for lack of tax benefit under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph:

# Example 1.
Assume the same facts as in example (3) of paragraph (b)(6) of § 1.1251-1. M's excess deductions account balance as of the close of 1975 is computed, in accordance with the additional facts assumed, in the table below:

Computed by treating the section 1245 gain of $6,000 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of § 1.1251-3 as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming.
For allocation of the $25,000 of gain recognized as ordinary income to the land and herd, and for treatment of the gain recognized in excess of $25,000 see example (3) of paragraph (b)(6) of § 1.1251-1.

# Example 2.
A is an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. In 1971, A makes a single disposition of farm recapture property (other than land) realizing a gain of $46,000 of which $15,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). The gain to which section 1251(c)(1) applies (computed before applying the excess deductions account limitation in section 1251(c)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(4)(i) of § 1.1251-1) is $31,000 (i.e., $46,000 minus $15,000). The treatment of the gain realized on the disposition in excess of the $15,000 recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1) and the balance in A's excess deductions account as of the close of 1971 is computed, in accordance with the facts assumed, in the table below:

(3)
Amount necessary to adjust the excess deductions account with respect to deductions which did not result in a reduction of the taxpayer's tax
—(i)
In general.
Under section 1251(b)(3)(A), a subtraction is made from the excess deductions account to adjust the account for deductions that did not result in a reduction of the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year or any preceding taxable year. The amounts to be subtracted are determined under subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph in accordance with the rules in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph. This subtraction shall be made before determining the amount of gain to which section 1251(c) applies. The amount subtracted under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is a temporary subtraction made solely to determine the amount in the excess deductions account for purposes of the limitation in section 1251(c)(2).
(ii)
Temporary subtraction.
The amount temporarily subtracted from the excess deductions account for a taxable year is the sum of the farm portion of (
a
) any net operating loss for such taxable year which does not reduce taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) in a prior year, and (
b
) any net operating loss from a prior taxable year which is carried to such taxable year but which does not reduce taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) in such taxable year.
(iii)
Permanent subtraction.
The amount permanently subtracted from the excess deductions account for a taxable year is the excess of the farm portion of any net operating loss which may be carried to the preceding year (reducing by the portion of such loss which reduced taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction under section 172(a)) for such preceding year) over the amount of such loss which may be carried to the taxable year, but the subtraction shall not be made earlier than the taxable year in which the excess deductions account is increased by reason of such loss.
(iv)
Rules of application.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the following rules shall apply:
(
a
) The farm portion of a net operating loss is that portion of such loss attributable to the trade or business of farming. Such portion and the remaining portion (hereinafter referred to as the nonfarm loss) shall be absorbed pro rata. If a farm net loss is not added to the excess deductions account in the year in which such loss occurs, the net operating loss (if any) for such year shall be treated as a nonfarm loss.
(
b
) In the case of an individual (other than a trust), the farm portion of a net operating loss shall be decreased by an amount, if any, equal to the excess of $25,000 (or the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) over the nonfarm adjusted gross income. Such amount shall be added to the nonfarm portion of such net operating loss.
(
c
) The amounts considered as reducing taxable income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in the taxable year shall be determined on the basis of a tentative computation of taxable income for such year in which the gain realized from the disposition of property to which section 1251(c)(1) applied shall be computed without regard to the excess deductions account limitation.
(v)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A is an unmarried individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year. For the years 1970 through 1974, A's items of income and deductions are as shown in the table below. A's personal deductions are disregarded. A had no income or loss for any year prior to 1970. Based upon such amounts and the computations shown below, A must recognize as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $35,325 for 1971, $10,000 for 1972, $3,925 for 1973, and $150,000 for 1974.

Electing small business corporation. (a)
In the case of an electing small business corporation, the amounts to be subtracted under subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, shall be the sum of the amounts under such subdivisions computed with respect to each shareholder of the corporation for the taxable year of the shareholder with which or within which the taxable year of the corporation ends, by applying (
b
) of this subdivision (vi), in lieu of subdivision (iv)(
a
) of this subparagraph.
(
b
) For purposes of (
a
) of this subdivision, the farm portion of a shareholder's net operating loss is that portion of the net operating loss of such shareholder attributable to the corporation's farm net loss, and such portion and the remaining portion shall be considered to be absorbed pro rata. If a corporation's farm net loss is not added to its excess deduction account in the year in which such loss occurs, no portion of a shareholder's net operating loss for the taxable year of the shareholder with which or within which such taxable year of the corporation ends shall be attributable to such corporation's farm net loss.
(d)
Exception for taxpayers using certain accounting methods
—(1)
General rule.
Under section 1251(b)(4), except to the extent that a taxpayer has succeeded to an excess deductions account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section (relating to receipt of farm recapture property in certain corporate and gift transactions), additions to the account shall not be required by a taxpayer who elects to compute taxable income from the trade or business of farming (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1251-3:
(i) By using inventories for all property which may be inventoried except as to property to which subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies, and
(ii) In accordance with subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, by charging to capital account all expenditures paid or incurred which are properly chargeable to capital account including such expenditures which the taxpayer may, under chapter 1 of the Code or regulations prescribed thereunder, otherwise treat or elect to treat as expenditures which are not chargeable to capital account.
For rules as to procedure of making the election, effect of a change in method of accounting upon making the election, and conditions for revoking the election, see subparagraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively, of this paragraph.
(2)
Inventories.
The absence of property which may be inventories shall not preclude a taxpayer from making an election under section 3251(b)(4). Any acceptable inventory method will satisfy the requirement of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph.
(3)
Property chargeable to capital account
—(i)
In general.
Property subject to the capitalization requirement prescribed in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph includes all property described in section 1231(b) (1) and (3), without regard to any holding period therein provided, which is used in the trade or business of farming. Thus, for example, property subject to the capitalization requirement includes property used in the trade or business of farming of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation and real property so used regardless of the period held, and livestock used in the trade or business of farming which is held for draft, breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes regardless of the period held.
(ii)
Expenditures which must be capitalized.
Expenditures subject to the requirement of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph are all expenditures, whether direct or indirect, paid or incurred, which are properly chargeable to capital account. For examples of the meaning of the term
properly chargeable to capital account,
see §§ 1.61-4, 1.162-12, 1.263(a)-1, and 1.263(a)-2, and paragraph (a)(4) (ii) and (iii) of § 1.446-1. Other examples of expenditures referred to in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph are expenditures under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation), 180 (relating to fertilizer, etc.), 182 (relating to land clearing), and 266 (relating to certain carrying charges) which (without regard to section 1251) a taxpayer may treat or elect to treat as expenditures which are not chargeable to capital account. Thus, for example, with respect to developing a farm, ranch, orchard, or grove, amounts properly chargeable to capital account include amounts paid or incurred for upkeep, taxes, interest, and other carrying charges, water for irrigation, fertilizing, controlling undergrowth, and the cultivating and spraying of trees. For a further example, with respect to a produced animal, amounts properly chargeable to capital account for the animal include all expenditures paid or incurred for producing the animal, such as for stud, breeding, and veterinary services, as well as all amounts paid or incurred with respect to the
brood animal during the gestation period of the produced animal including all amounts paid or incurred for feed, maintenance, utilities, indirect overhead, depreciation, insurance, and carrying charges. Direct and indirect expenditures properly chargeable to capital account with respect to raising an animal may include, in addition to expenditures for feed, maintenance, etc., expenditures for training. Direct and indirect expenditures with respect to feed may include, in the case of a grazing operation, fees for the rental of grazing land, and the portion of all labor, taxes, interest, fencing costs, and carrying charges paid or incurred by the taxpayer allocable to grazing. For purposes of this subparagraph, reasonable allocations shall be made by the taxpayer of items between animals held for different purposes and as to each animal held. However, all amounts allocated to a brood animal during the period of gestation are, for purposes of this subparagraph, entirely chargeable to the capital of the produced animal.
(iii)
Unharvested crops.
With respect to unharvested crops to which section 1231(b)(4) applies, see section 268 and paragraph (g) of § 1.1016-5 (relating, respectively, to disallowance of certain deductions and to adjustments to basis).
(iv)
Changes in character of property.
If, in a taxable year subsequent to the first taxable year to which an election under section 1251(b)(4) applies, property which was not subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph becomes subject to such requirements, then the following rules shall apply:
(
a
) The adjusted basis of such property at the beginning of the taxable year in which it becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall be equal to the amount its adjusted basis would have been on such date had it been accounted for in accordance with such requirements (taking into account, if applicable, the depreciation which would have been allowed as determined by the taxpayer using a period, salvage value, and methods that would have been proper).
(
b
) At the beginning of the taxable year in which such property becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph:
(
1
) If such property was not included in the opening inventory, the amount equal to the excess of its adjusted basis as computed in (
a
) of this subdivision over its adjusted basis as of the close of the preceding taxable year, or
(
2
) If such property was included in the opening inventory, such opening inventory shall be reduced by the inventory value of such property included therein and the amount of the difference between the adjusted basis for the property computed in (
a
) of this subdivision and such inventory value,
Shall be added to gross income for such taxable year and shall be treated as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of § 1.1251-3, except that if the difference in (
b)(2
) of this subdivision represents an excess of such inventory value over the adjusted basis for the property computed in (
a
) of this subdivision then such excess shall be subtracted from gross income for such taxable year and shall be treated as a deduction allowed which is directly connected with carrying on the trade or business of farming under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of § 1.1251-3.
(
c
) If any deductions for depreciation are treated as amounts which would have been allowed in a prior taxable year or years for purposes of (
a
) of this subdivision, such deduction shall be treated as having been allowed for purposes of applying sections 1245 and 1250 in the same taxable year or years and thus included in the amount of adjustments reflected in adjusted basis within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.1245-2 or depreciation adjustments within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1250-2 (as the case may be).
(
d
) For purposes of this subparagraph (3), if during a taxable year property becomes subject to the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, it shall be considered subject to such requirements on each day it is held during such year.
(
e
) The adjusted basis under (
a
) of this subdivision of property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation shall be its basis for which
deductions may be computed under section 167.
(v)
Example.
The provisions of subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
On January 1, 1974, A, an individual taxpayer who in a previous year had elected under section 1251(b)(4) to compute income from the trade or business of farming by using inventories and by charging to capital account all items properly chargeable to capital under the rules of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, purchases a herd of six-month-old feeder calves for $13,000. During 1974, in connection with such herd, A incurred raising costs of $4,000 and carrying charges of $1,600 which would have been properly chargeable to capital account within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph if the herd had not been included in inventory. A determines under his unit-livestock method that on December 31, 1974, the inventory value of the herd is $17,000. On March 1, 1975, A decides to use one-half of the herd for breeding purposes with such part of the herd becoming subject to the capitalization requirements. On January 1, 1975, the adjusted basis for the animals held for breeding purposes, computed under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(a) of this subparagraph, is $9,300 (that is, the aggregate of one-half of the purchase price of $13,000 for the entire herd of feeder calves, $6,500, one-half of the carrying charges of $1,600 incurred during 1974 in connection with the entire herd, $800, and one-half of the $4,000 of raising costs incurred during 1974 for the entire herd, $2,000). There is no adjustment for the depreciation which would have been allowed since no animal in the herd had reached an acceptable breeding age. Therefore, A as of January 1, 1975, must under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(
b)(2
) of this subparagraph subtract $8,500 from his opening inventory value of $17,000. However, A has not changed his method of accounting with respect to such animals. Under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(
b)(2
) of this subparagraph, A for 1975 will add $800 to his gross income (that is, the difference between the adjusted basis for the calves to be used for breeding purposes, $9,300, over the inventory value of such animals, $8,500). Such amount under the provisions of subdivision (iv)(
b
) shall be treated as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming under paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1251-3.
(4)
Time and manner of making election
—(i)
In general.
The election under section 1251(b)(4) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be filed within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. Such election shall be made and filed by attaching a statement of such election signed by the taxpayer to the return for the first taxable year for which the election is made. The statement shall contain a declaration that the taxpayer is making an election under section 1251(b)(4) of the Code and that taxable income from the trade or business of farming is computed by using inventories for all property, which may be inventoried and by charging to capital account all expenditures paid or incurred which are properly chargeable to capital account (including such expenditures which the taxpayer may, under chapter 1 of the Code or regulations prescribed thereunder, otherwise treat or elect to treat as expenditures which are not properly chargeable to capital account). Additionally, the statement must contain the information prescribed by subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, if applicable.
(ii)
Joint return.
If for a taxable year taxpayers file a joint return under section 6013, the election referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph must be made by both such taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. If, however, in such case either of such taxpayers has for a previous taxable year made such an election, then only the taxpayer who has not made such election is required to comply with the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. The taxpayer who previously made such an election shall attach a statement to the return specifying the taxable year for which the election was made and with whom the election was filed.
(5)
Change in method of accounting, etc.
—(i)
In general.
If, in order to comply with an election made under section 1251(b)(4), a taxpayer must change his method of accounting (in computing taxable income from the trade or business of farming) by placing in inventory a class of items not previously treated as in an inventory or by charging to capital account a class of items which had been consistently treated as an expense or as part of inventory (see paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(
b
) of § 1.446-1), the taxpayer will be deemed
to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner as to such change in method of accounting solely as to such items and there shall be taken into account in accordance with section 481 of the Code and the regulations thereunder those adjustments which are determined to be necessary by reason of such change solely as to such items in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. For purposes of section 481(a)(2), such change in method of accounting with respect to only such items shall be treated as a change not initiated by the taxpayer and, thus, under paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.481-1, no part of the adjustments required under section 481 with respect to such items shall be based on amounts which are taken into account in computing income (or which should have been taken into account had the new method of accounting been used) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, or ending before August 17, 1954.
(ii)
Additional information.
If, in order to comply with an election made under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph a taxpayer (or in the case of a joint return one or both taxpayers) changes his method of accounting, then in addition to the information required to be filed under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph the taxpayer must file on Form 3115 as part of such election all the information described in paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.446-1 (relating to change in method of accounting), but the time prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.446-1 for filing Form 3115 shall not apply.
(iii)
Election made before May 7, 1976.
If an election referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph was made before May 7, 1976, the taxpayer shall file not later than August 5, 1976, such information referred to in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph not previously required by applicable regulations to be filed in order to make such election, and, in addition, if subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies, the taxpayer shall file not later than August 5, 1976, on Form 3115 the information referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph with the district director, or the director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the election was filed. For this purpose, Form 3115 shall be attached to a statement clearly identifying the election referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and the first taxable year to which it applied.
(6)
Revocability of election
—(i)
In general.
An election referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is binding on the taxpayer or in the case of a joint return both taxpayers) for the taxable year of such election and for all subsequent taxable years (regardless of whether they continue to file a joint return) and may not be revoked except with the consent of the Commissioner. Since revocation would constitute a change in method of accounting, in order to secure the Commissioner's consent to the revocation of such an election and to a change of the taxpayer's method of accounting, all the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.446-1 must be met including the requirement that Form 3115 must be filed within 180 days after the beginning of the taxable year in which it is desired to make the change. See section 481 and the regulations thereunder (relating to certain adjustments required by such changes).
(ii)
Revocation of elections made prior to May 7, 1976.
If on or before May 7, 1976, an election under section 1251(b)(4) has been made, such election may be revoked without permission of the Commissioner by filing on or before August 5, 1976, with the district director or the director of the internal revenue service center with whom the election was filed a statement of revocation of an election under section 1251(b)(4). If such election to revoke is for a period which falls within one or more taxable years for which an income tax returns shall be filed for any such taxable years for which the computation of taxable income is affected by reason of such revocation.
(e)
Transfer of excess deductions account
—(1)
Certain corporate transactions
—(i)
In general.
Under section 1251(b)(5)(A), in the case of a transfer described in section 1251(d)(3) and paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1251-4 to which section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings), 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations), or 381 (relating to
carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account as of the close of the day of distribution or transfer the excess deductions account of the transferor. Determinations under this subdivision shall be made under subdivisions (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph regardless of whether section 381 applies. For treatment as farm recapture property of stock or securities received in certain transfers to controlled corporations to which section 1251(d)(3) (but not section 1251(b)(5)(A)) applies, see section 1251(d)(6) and paragraph (f) of § 1.1251-4.
(ii)
Acquiring corporation.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, determinations as to which corporation is the acquiring corporation shall be made under paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.381(a)-1.
(iii)
Certain operating rules.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the operating rules of section 381(b) and § 1.381(b)-1 shall apply. Thus, for example, except in the case of a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F) (whether or not such reorganization also qualifies under any other provision of section 368(a)(1)), the amount of the excess deductions account of the transferor shall be computed, as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer (as determined under paragraph (b) of § 1.381(b)-1), as if the taxable year of the transferor closed on such date (regardless of whether the taxable year actually closed). In the case of a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F) (whether or not such reorganization also qualifies under any other provision of section 368(a)(1)), the acquiring corporation's excess deductions account shall be treated for purposes of section 1251 just as the transferor corporation's excess deductions account would have been treated if there had been no reorganization.
(iv)
Excess deductions account balance.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the amount in the transferor's excess deductions account as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer referred to in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall be the amount in such account determined after making all the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (other than subtractions under paragraph (5)(A) of section 1251(b) and this subparagraph) for the taxable year ending (or considered ending) on such date including a subtraction by reason of gain (if any) recognized under section 1251(c)(1) by reason of a disposition which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift transaction to which section 1251(d)(1) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1251-4 apply.
(2)
Certain gifts
—(i)
In general.
If farm recapture property is disposed of by gift (including for purposes of this paragraph in a transaction which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift or a transaction treated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a gift), and if such gift is made during any
1-year period
(described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) for which the
potential gain limitation percentage
(as computed in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) exceeds 25 percent, then the provisions of subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph shall apply in respect of such gift.
(ii)
One-year period.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a
1-year period
is a period of 365 days beginning on the date a gift is made by the donor.
(iii)
Potential gain limitation percentage.
Under this subdivision, the
potential gain limitation percentage
for any such 1-year period is a percentage equal to (
a
) the sum of the potential gains (determined as of the first day of such period) on each item of farm recapture property held by such taxpayer on such first day disposed of by gift by the taxpayer during such period, divided by (
b
) the sum of the potential gains (determined as of the first day of such period) on all farm recapture property held by such taxpayer on such first day.
(iv)
Allocation ratio.
With respect to each gift of property (to which the provisions of this subdivision apply) made during a taxable year, each donee shall succeed (at the time the first of such gifts is made during such taxable year) to the same proportion of (
a
) the donor's excess deductions account determined, as of the close of such taxable year of the donor, after making all the applicable additions and subtractions
under section 1251(b) (other than subtractions under section 1251(b)(5) and this paragraph), as (
b
) the potential gain (determined immediately prior to the time the first of such gifts is made during such taxable year) on the property (held by the donor immediately prior to such time) received by such donee bears to (
c
) The aggregate potential gain (determined immediately prior to such time) on all farm recapture property held by the donor immediately prior to such time.
(v)
Definitions and certain special rules.
For purposes of this subparagraph:
(
a
) The term
potential gain
means an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of property over its adjusted basis, but, in the case of land, limited under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1 to the extent of the deductions allowable in respect of such land pursuant to an election (if any) under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation expenditures) and 182 (relating to expenditures by farmers for clearing land) for the taxable year of disposition and the four immediately preceding taxable years regardless of whether any such preceding taxable year begins before December 31, 1969. See section 1251(e)(5).
(
b
) Property held on the first day of a one-year period shall include property received by gift during such one-year period and the potential gain with respect to such property, for purposes of making the computations under this subparagraph, shall be the potential gain in the hands of the donor reduced by the amount of gain (in the case of an exchange which is part a sale and part a gift) taken into account by the donor.
(
c
) Property held by a taxpayer on the first day of a one-year period which property becomes farm recapture property in the hands of such taxpayer during such one-year period shall be considered to be farm recapture property on each day of such one-year period.
(vi)
Part-sale-part-gift transaction.
If property is disposed of in a transaction which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, then for purposes of subdivisions (iii)(
a
) and (iv)(
b
) of this subparagraph the potential gain with respect to the property transferred shall be reduced by the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor.
(vii)
Joint return.
For application of the provisions of this subparagraph with respect to a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, see paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that all taxpayers are unmarried individuals.

# Example 1.
The only farm recapture property A owns is a farm, consisting of farm land and certain farm equipment which is farm recapture property. During the period involved, there was no deduction allowable under section 175 or 182 to any person owning an interest in the farm. A, who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, makes a series of gifts of undivided interests in the farm. In these circumstances, computations may be made by reference to percentages of undivided interests in the farm. The potential gain limitation percentages for each applicable 1-year period are computed, in accordance with the additional facts assumed, in the table below:

Since the potential gain limitation percentage for the 1-year period beginning on September 1, 1970, exceeds 25 percent, a portion of A's excess deductions account, under the provisions of subparagraph (2)(iv) of this paragraph, is succeeded to by C and D. Similarly, since such percentage for the 1-year period beginning May 1, 1973, exceeds 25 percent, such provisions apply to the gift made to F. Since, however, such percentage is 25 percent or less for all 1-year periods in which the gift to E falls (i.e., 25 percent and 14.28 percent for the 1-year periods beginning, respectively, on August 1, 1971, and March 1, 1972) such provisions do not apply to the gift to E.

# Example:
2. (i) G uses the calendar year as his taxable year and H uses a taxable year ending June 30. As of the close of 1972, G has $100,000 in his excess deductions account, determined before any subtractions under section 1251(b)(5) and this paragraph. G owns only three items of farm recapture property, none of which is land. On May 1, 1972, G makes a gift of farm recapture property No. 1 to his son and on September 1, 1972, G sells to H for $80,000 farm recapture property No. 2 in a transaction which is in part a sale and in part a gift. G owns throughout all relevant periods farm recapture property No. 3. The potential gain limitation percentage for G's one-year period beginning May 1, 1972, is computed in accordance with the additional facts assumed in the table below:
Farm Recapture Property
No. 1
No. 2
No. 3
Total
(1) Fair market value 5/1/72
$25,000

(4) Sum of potential gains on properties disposed of by gift during period less gain taken into account by transferor on part-sale-part-gift
$15,000
$20,000
$35,000
(5) Potential gain limitation percentage (total line (4), divided by total line (3))
58

%
Since the potential gain limitation percentage for the one-year period beginning on May 1, 1972, exceeds 25 percent, the provisions of subparagraph (2)(iv) of this paragraph apply to the gift to the son and that portion of the disposition to H which is a gift.
(ii) The portion of G's excess deductions account determined, as of the close of 1972, before any subtraction under section 1251(b)(5) and this paragraph, allocated to the son and to H as of May 1, 1972, is computed in the table below:

Accordingly, the amount of G's excess deduction account succeeded to as of May 1, 1972, is $25,000 by the son and $33,333 by H.
(f)
Joint return
—(1)
Joint excess deductions account.
If for a taxable year a taxpayer and his spouse file a joint return under section 6013, then for such taxable year each taxpayer shall (if necessary) establish and maintain a joint excess deductions account. Such joint excess deductions account shall consist of the aggregate of the separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse. A separately maintained excess deductions account shall be computed under the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except that for each taxable year a joint return is filed:
(i) The $50,000 amount in the nonfarm adjusted gross income limitation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be considered satisfied if the combined nonfarm adjusted gross income of both spouses exceeds $50,000,
(ii) The $25,000 amount in the farm net loss exclusion in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be allocated between the two spouses in proportion to the farm net loss of each spouse having a farm net loss, and
(iii) The separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse shall be reduced, if necessary, below zero, by the amount of such spouse's farm net income (computed as if a separate return were filed) plus the amount of gain (computed under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) which is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) in respect of a disposition of farm recapture property owned by the taxpayer.
(2)
Surviving spouse.
For purposes of this paragraph, a joint return does not include a return of a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2 relating to a spouse who died during either of his two taxable years immediate preceding the taxable year) which is treated as a joint return of a husband and wife under section 6013.
(3)
Application of excess deductions account limitation in joint return year.
In the case of a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, the aggregate of the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (after applying paragraph (b) (2)(o) and (3) of § 1.125-1, if applicable) shall not exceed the amount in the joint excess deductions account (that is, the aggregate of the separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse) at the close of the taxable year after subtracting from each such separately maintained account the amount specified in section 1251(b) (3) (A) and paragraph (c) (1) (i) of this section as modified by the rules of this paragraph. For the amount of limitation for a taxable year for which a separate return is filed, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section. For determinations as to which dispositions are taken into account for any taxable year, see paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.1251-1.
(4)
Certain gifts
—(i)
In general.
If farm recapture property is transferred as a gift by a spouse to a person other than a spouse during a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, the spouses shall for purposes of applying the provisions of section 1251(b) (5) (B) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section be treated as a single taxpayer. Thus, under paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.1251-2, the potential gain limitation percentage and the proportion for allocating the amount in the joint excess deductions account to one or more donees shall be determined by treating the spouses as a single taxpayer. However, with respect to each gift by a spouse, such
spouse's separately maintained excess deductions account shall be reduced (below zero, if necessary) by the amount of the joint excess deductions account balance to which the donee of such gift succeeded under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Gift between spouses.
If farm recapture property is transferred by gift by one spouse to another spouse during a taxable year for which a joint return is filed, such gift shall not affect the balance in the joint excess deductions account but its effect on the separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse shall be determined as if separate returns were filed, but only after applying subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(5)
Allocation of joint excess deductions account upon filing separate returns
—(i)
In general.
If for any reason a taxpayer and his spouse cease to file a joint return, then except as provided in this subparagraph the amount of the separately maintained excess deductions account of each spouse as of the close of the last taxable year for which a joint return was filed shall be the amount of such spouse's excess deductions account as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which they cease filing a joint return.
(ii)
Deficit.
If under subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph one of the spouses has a deficit in his separately maintained excess deductions account as of the close of the last taxable year for which a joint return was filed, then as of the beginning of the first taxable year for which they cease filing a joint return:
(
a
) The spouse who had such deficit shall have an excess deductions account of zero, and
(
b
) The other spouse shall have an excess deductions account equal to the amount prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph minus the amount of such deficit.
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (4) of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, except that H and W file a joint return under section 6013 and that H has a farm net loss of only $40,000. Thus, since the nonfarm adjusted gross income for calendar year 1971 was $60,000 for H and $30,000 for W, their combined nonfarm adjusted gross income exceeds $50,000, thereby satisfying under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph the $50,000 limitation of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Assume further that for 1971 only W makes a dispostion of farm recapture property (other than land and section 1245 property). As a result of such disposition, W realizes a gain of $14,000. Accordingly, for 1971, the separately maintained excess deductions accounts of H and W, their joint excess deductions account, and the treatment of the gain realized by W on the disposition of the farm recapture property are computed, in accordance with the facts assumed in the table below:

§ 1.1251-3
Definitions relating to section 1251.
(a)
Farm recapture property
—(1)
In general.
(i) The term
farm recapture property
means any property (other than section 1250 property as defined in section 1250(c)) which, in the hands of the taxpayer is or was property:
(
a
) Which is described in section 1231(b)(1) (relating to business property held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), section 1231(b)(3) (relating to livestock), or section 1231(b)(4) (relating to an unharvested crop), and
(
b
) Which, at the time the property qualifies under (
a
) of this subdivision, is used in the trade or business of farming (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section).
(ii) The term
farm recapture property
also includes:
(
a
) Property acquired by gift and property acquired in a transaction to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, if such property was farm recapture property within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph in the hands of the transferor, and
(
b
) Property the basis of which in the hands of the taxpayer holding such property is determined by reference to the basis of other property which in the hands of such taxpayer was farm recapture property within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this paragraph. For purposes of (
b
) of this subdivison (ii) property whose basis is determined in accordance with the last sentence of section 1033(c) shall be considered as having as basis determined by reference to the property whose conversion gave rise to the application of such section.
(iii)
Leasehold of farm recapture property.
If property is farm recapture property under this subparagraph, a leasehold of such property is also farm recapture property is also farm recapture property to the same extent as described in, and in accordance with the principles of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1245-3.
(iv) If property described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is stock or securities received in certain corporate transactions described in section 1251(d)(6), see paragraph (f) of § 1.1251-4 for determination as to extent such stock or securities is farm recapture property.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
On December 15, 1971, A, an individual calendar year taxpayer engaged in the trade or business of farming (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) exchanges in a transaction which qualifies under section 1031(a) (relating to an exchange of property held for productive use or investment) tractor No. 1 which A acquired on March 1, 1971, for tractor No. 2. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, tractor No. 1 is farm recapture property as the tractor was used in the trade or business of farming and was held for a period in excess of 6 months. Under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, tractor No. 2 is farm recapture property as the basis of tractor No. 2 in the hands of A is determined with reference to the adjusted basis of tractor No. 1.
(b)
Farm net loss
—(1)
In general.
The term
farm net loss
means the amount by which:
(i) The deductions allowed or allowable for the taxable year by chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code which are directly connected with the carrying on of the trade or business of farming, exceed
(ii) The gross income derived from such trade or business.
(2)
Disposition of farm recapture property.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, no gain or loss (regardless of how treated) resulting from
the disposition of farm recapture property shall be taken into account, except that under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph gain upon disposition of such property which is recognized as ordinary income by reason of section 1245(a)(1) shall be taken into account. Thus, for example, if land used in the trade or business of farming were disposed of and gain of $3,000 was realized, then none of such gain would be taken into account in computing farm net loss and farm net income even if all or a portion of such gain is recognized as ordinary income by reason of section 1251(c)(1), section 1252(a)(1), or both. If such land were disposed of at a loss, the result would be the same. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to the exclusion of gain or loss from the disposition of farm recapture property from the computation of nonfarm adjusted gross income.
(3)
Amount of deduction under section 172(a) attributable to farm net loss.
(i) If all or a portion of a net operating loss (within the meaning of section 172(c)) for a taxable year is absorbed in another taxable year as a carryover or carry back, then for purposes of determining the amount of deductions referred to in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for such other taxable year the portion of the amount absorbed in such other taxable year which is attributable to amounts directly connected with the carrying on of the trade or business of farming shall be an amount equal to the amount absorbed, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the farm net loss for the taxable year the net operating loss arose (but not in excess of the net operating loss for such year) and the denominator of which is the amount of the net operating loss for such year.
(ii) No portion of a farm net loss added to the excess deductions account in the year a net operating loss arose (or which would have been added to such account but for the application of the $25,000 or $12,500 farm net loss exclusion under paragraph (b) (2)(ii) or (4)(i)(
b
) of § 1.1251-2) shall be taken into account under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph in any other taxable year. Accordingly the same farm net loss shall not be added to the excess deductions account more than once and a farm net loss for any taxable year shall not be subject to the $25,000 or $12,500 exclusion more than once.
(iii) If a net operating loss for a current taxable year attributable in whole or part to a farm net loss is carried back and absorbed in a preceding taxable year no redetermination shall be made with respect to (
a
) the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) and paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-1 in any taxable year preceding the current taxable year, and (
b
) the amount of the taxpayer's excess deductions account allocated under paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.1251-2 to a donee as of the close of any taxable year preceding the current taxable year.
(4)
Special rules as to estates and trusts.
In the case of an estate or trust, computations of amounts under this paragraph shall be made without regard to any deductions under section 651 or 661. If on the termination of an estate or trust the beneficiaries succeeding to its property are allowed a deduction under section 642(h) (relating to unused loss carryovers and excess deductions on termination available to beneficiaries), to the extent the carryover or excess deduction is attributable to a farm loss it shall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust. The amount of a carryover or of excess deductions from a particular taxable year of an estate or trust succeeded to under section 642(h) shall be allocated between amounts attributable to a farm net loss and other amounts in the same proportion as the farm net loss for such year bears to the amount of such carryover or of excess deductions. If there is more than one beneficiary, the total farm net loss succeeded to by all the beneficiaries shall be allocated to each beneficiary in proportion to the deduction of each under section 642(h).
(c)
Farm net income.
The term
farm net income
means the amount by which the amount referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds the amount referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(d)
Nonfarm adjusted gross income
—(1)
In general.
The term
nonfarm adjusted gross income
means adjusted gross income (taxable income in the case of a
taxpayer other than an individual) computed without regard to:
(i) Income or deductions taken into account in computing farm net loss and farm net income,
(ii) Gains and losses (regardless of how treated) resulting from the disposition of farm recapture property, and
(iii) In the case of an estate or trust, the principles of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, to the extent applicable, shall apply.
(2)
Special rules.
The following rules in addition to the rules of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall apply in computing the adjusted gross income of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation:
(i) The amount of any distribution described in section 1373 (c)(2) made by the corporation shall be disregarded,
(ii) For purposes of computing the amount includible in the gross income of a shareholder under section 1373(b), the corporation's undistributable taxable income shall equal the corporation's nonfarm adjusted gross income (as defined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) minus the amount described in section 1373(c)(1), and
(iii) For purposes of computing a shareholder's deduction under section 1374, the corporation's net operating loss shall be computed without regard to the items referred to in subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.
(e)
Trade or business of farming
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 1251, the term
trade or business of farming
includes any trade or business with respect to which the taxpayer may compute gross income under § 1.61-4, expenses under § 1.162-12, make an election under section 175, 180, or 182, or use an inventory method referred to in § 1.471-6. Such term does not include any activity not engaged in for profit within the meaning of section 183 and section 183-2.
(2)
Horse racing.
If a taxpayer is engaged in the raising of horses, including horses which are bred or purchased, then for purposes of section 1251 the term
trade or business of farming
also includes the racing of such horses by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer purchases a yearling and develops it to the racing stage, the term
trade or business of farming
includes the racing of such horse.
(3)
Several businesses of farming.
If a taxpayer is engaged in more than one trade or business of farming, all such trades and businesses shall be treated as one trade or business.

§ 1.1251-4
Exceptions and limitations.
(a)
Exception for gifts
—(1)
General rule.
Section 1251(d)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
gift
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1245-4 shall apply. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of farm recapture property, see section 170(e) and § 1.170A-4.
(2)
Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.
Where a disposition of farm recpature property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed:
(i) In the case of farm recapture property other than land, the excess of the amount realized over adjusted basis, and
(ii) In the case of land, the lower of the amount in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or the potential gain (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1.
(3)
Treatment of land in hand of transferee.
See paragraph (g) of this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of land to which this paragraph applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar year taxpayer, makes one disposition of farm recapture property during 1976. On March 2, 1976, A makes a gift to B (also a calendar year taxpayer) of a parcel of land which he had on January 15, 1971. On the date of such disposition, the excess of the fair market value ($65,000) over the adjusted basis of the land ($40,000) is $25,000 and the sum of the deductions allowable in respect of such land under
sections 175 and 182 is $21,000 for 1971 and $3,000 (attributable to 1975) for the taxable year of disposition and the four immediately preceding taxable years. Thus, the potential gain (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1) is limited to $3,000. At the end of 1976 (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)), there is a balance in A's excess deductions account of $25,000. However, upon making the gift, A recognizes no gain under section 1251(c)(1) or section 1252(a)(1). See subparagraph (a)(1) of this paragraph and paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1252-2. For treatment of the land in the hands of B, see example (1) of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For effect of the gift on the excess deductions accounts of A and B, see paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.1251-2.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that A transfers the land to B for $50,000. Thus, the gain realized is $10,000 (amount realized, $50,000, minus adjusted basis $40,000), and A has made a gift of $15,000 (fair market value, $65,000, minus amount realized, $50,000). Since under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the potential gain ($3,000) is lower than the gain realized ($10,000), the gain to which section 1251(c)(1) could apply is limited by subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph to $3,000. Thus, as A has $25,000 in his excess deductions account, $3,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). See example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.1252-2 for computation of gain of $7,000 which is recognized as ordinary income by A under section 1252(a)(1). For treatment of the land in the hands of B, see example (2) of paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(b)
Exception for transfers at death
—(1)
General rule.
Section 1251(d)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
transfer at death
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply.
(2)
Treatment of land in hands of transferee.
If as of the date a person acquires land which is farm recapture property from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then on such date the potential gain in respect to such land is zero.
(c)
Certain corporate transactions
—(1)
Limitation on amount of gain.
Under section 1251(d)(3), upon a transfer of property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1251) over (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). For purposes of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, in case of a transfer of both farm recapture property and property other than farm recapture property in a single transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the farm recapture property (as determined in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1) shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of farm recapture property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1251) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). Section 1251(d)(3) does not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Transfers covered.
The transfers referred to in subparagraphs (1) of this paragraph are transfers of farm recapture property in which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For the application of section 1251(d)(3) to such a complete
liquidation, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, for example, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply to a liquidating distribution of farm recapture property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.
(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to corporation controlled by transferor).
(iii) Section 351 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).
(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).
(3)
Partnerships.
For the application of section 1251 to partnerships, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Treatment of land in hands of transferee.
See paragraph (g) of this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of land to which this paragraph applies.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, makes one disposition of farm recapture property during 1971. On January 20, 1971. A transfers farm recapture property (other than land and section 1245 property), having an adjusted basis of $22,000, to corporation M in exchange for stock in M worth $35,000 plus $15,000 in cash in a transaction qualifying under section 351. Thus, the amount realized is $50,000, and the gain realized is the excess of the amount realized, $50,000, over the adjusted basis, $22,000, or $28,000. Without regard to section 1251, A would recognize gain of $15,000 under section 351(b), and M's basis for the farm recapture property would be determined under section 362(a) by reference to its basis in the hands of A. Assume further that the balance in A's excess deductions account (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)) at the close of 1971 is $20,000. Thus, since such balance in the excess deductions account ($20,000) is lower than the gain realized ($28,000), is subparagraph (1) of this paragraph did not apply, gain of $20,000 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). However, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph limits the amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) to $15,000.
(ii) If, however, A transferred the farm recapture property to M solely in exchange for stock worth $50,000, then, because of the application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph he would not recognize any gain under section 1251(c)(1). If, instead, A transferred the farm recapture property to M in exchange for stock worth $25,000 and $25,000 cash, only $20,000 (the amount of such balance in the excess deductions account) of the gain of $25,000 recognized under section 351(b) would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). The remaining $5,000 of gain recognized under section 351(b) may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231. In the hands of M, the property received from A is farm recapture property under the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(ii) of § 1.1251-3. For treatment of the property received by A in such transaction; see section 1251(d)(6) and paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in subdivision (i) of example (1), except that the farm recapture property is section 1245 property. Assume further than $5,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1), and that as of the close of 1971, A has a balance of $15,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A) which, under paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-3, is computed by treating the $5,000 of gain to which section 1245 applies as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) is $10,000, computed as follows:
(1) Amount of gain under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph):
(a) Portion of gain realized ($28,000) in excess of amount recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1) ($5,000)
$23,000
(b) Excess deductions account balance
15,000
(c) Lower of (a) or (b)
15,000
(2) Limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
(a) Gain recognized (determined without regard to section 1251)
15,000
(b) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1)
5,000
(c) Difference
10,000
(3) Lower of line (1)(c) or line (2)(c)
10,000
(d)
Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions
—(1)
General rule.
Under section 1251(d)(4), if farm recapture property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1251) is not recognized in whole
or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1251) or (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns a herd of breeding cattle having an adjusted basis of $75,000 which he acquired on March 30, 1970, A receives insurance proceeds of $90,000. Thus, the gain realized is $15,000 (that is, the excess of the amount realized, $75,000), A makes no other disposition of farm recapture property during 1970. Assume that had the herd been sold at its fair market value on March 15, 1970, no gain would have been recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). As of the close of 1970, A has a balance of $12,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)). Thus, since the balance in the excess deductions account, $12,000, is lower than the gain realized, $15,000, the amount of gain which would be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) would be $12,000.
(ii) Assume further that A spends $72,000 of the insurance proceeds to purchase another breeding herd, $10,000 to purchase stock in the acquisition of control of a corporation which owns property similar or related in service or use to the destroyed breeding herd, and retains cash of $8,000. Both of the acquisitions by A qualify under section 1033(a)(3)(A), and A properly elects under section 1033(a)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder to limit recognition of gain to $8,000 (that is, the amount by which the amount realized from the conversion, $90,000 exceeds the cost of the stock and other property acquired to replace the converted property, $72,000 plus $10,000). Thus, since $8,000 is the amount of gain which would be recognized under section 1033(a)(3) (determined without regard to section 1251), and since that amount is lower than the gain of $12,000 which would be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the amount of gain recognized under section 1251(c)(1) is limited to $8,000. The stock purchased for $10,000 qualifies under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of § 1.1251-3 as farm recapture property.

# Example 2.
(i) A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns land which he had acquired on March 7, 1970, having an adjusted basis of $48,000, and a fair market value of $67,500. On January 15, 1975, A, as a result of a condemnation action, receives $67,500 (its fair market value) for the land. The aggregate of the deductions allowable in respect of such land under sections 175 and 182 is $18,000, with $5,000 of such aggregate attributable to 1970 and $13,000 of such aggregate attributable to 1970 and $13,000 of such aggregate attributable to 1975 and the four preceding taxable years. Thus, the potential gain (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1) is limited to $13,000, since that amount is lower than $19,500 (the excess of the fair market value of the land, $67,500, over its adjusted basis, $48,000). The gain realized by A is also $19,500. At the end of A's taxable year (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A)) there is a balance of $21,000 in the excess deductions account of A. Since the potential gain, $13,000, is lower than both the excess deductions account balance, $21,000, and the gain realized, $19,500, A would recognize $13,000 as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph).
(ii) Assume further that A spends the entire amount received, $67,500, to purchase stock in the acquisition of control of a corporation which owns property similar or related in service or use to A's condemned land which qualifies under section 1033(a)(3)(A), and A properly elects under section 1033(a)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder to limit recognition of gain to zero (that is, the amount by which the amount realized from the conversion, $67,500, exceeds the cost of the stock acquired to replace the converted land, $67,500). Thus, since no gain would be recognized under section 1033(a)(3) (determined without regard to section 1251), under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, no gain is recognized under section 1251(c)(1). The stock purchased for $67,500 qualifies under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of § 1.1251-3 as farm recapture property. See example (1) of paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1252-2 for a computation of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1).

# Example 3.
B, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns a herd of breeding cattle having an adjusted basis of $25,000 which he acquired on March 30, 1970. On March 15, 1976, the entire herd is destroyed by a blizzard and on March 20, 1976, B receives insurance proceeds of $90,000. Thus, the gain realized is $65,000 (that is, the excess of the amount realized, $90,000, over the adjusted basis, $25,000). B makes no other disposition of farm recapture property during 1976. B
spends $60,000 of the insurance proceeds to purchase another breeding herd and retains cash of $30,000. The acquisition by B qualifies under section 1033(a)(3)(A), and B properly elects under section 1033(a)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder to limit recognition of gain to $30,000 (that is, the amount by which the amount realized from the conversion, $90,000, exceeds the cost of the property acquired to replace the converted property, $60,000). Assume that the amount of gain recognized under section 1245(a)(1) is $20,000, and that as of the close of 1976 B has a balance of $100,000 in his excess deductions account (after making the applicable additions and subtractions under section 1251(b) (2) and (3)(A) which, under paragraph (b) of § 1.1251-3, is computed by treating the $20,000 of gain to which section 1245 applies as gross income derived from the trade or business of farming). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) is $10,000, computed as follows:
(1) Amount of gain under section 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph):
(a) Portion of gain realized ($65,000) in excess of amount recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1) ($20,000)
$45,000
(b) Excess deductions account balance
100,000
(c) Lower of (a) or (b)
45,000
(2) Limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
(a) Gain recognized (determined without regard to section 1251)
30,000
(b) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1)
$20,000
(c) Difference
10,000
(3) Lower of line (1)(c) or line (2)(c)
10,000
(3)
Application to single disposition of farm recapture property of one class and property of different class.
(i) If upon a sale of farm recapture property of one class gain would be recognized under section 1251(c)(1), and if such farm recapture property together with property of a different class or classes is disposed of in a single transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (without regard to section 1251(c)(1), then rules consistent with the principles of paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable realty) shall apply for purposes of allocating the amount realized to each of the classes of property disposed of and for purposes of determining what property the amount realized for each class consists of.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of property other than farm recapture property are (
a
) section 1245 property, (
b
) section 1250 property, and (
c
) other property.
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of farm recapture property are (
a
) hand, (
b
) farm recapture property other than land which is section 1245 property and (
c
) farm recapture property other than land which is not section 1245 property.
(4)
Treatment of land received in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.
The aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of land acquired in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall include the aggregate of the deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land transferred or converted (as the case may be) in such transaction minus the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) with respect to the land transferred or converted. Upon a subsequent disposition of such land, such deductions shall be treated as having been allowable in the same taxable year as they were allowable with respect to the land transferred or converted.
(e)
Partnerships.

(f)
Property transferred to controlled corporation.

(g)
Treatment of land received by a transferee in a disposition by gift and certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General rule.
If farm recapture property which is land is disposed of in a transaction which is either a gift to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies or a completely tax-free transfer to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, then for purposes of section 1251:
(i) The aggregate of the deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of such deductions for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition,
(ii) Upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee (including a computation of potential gain as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1), such
deductions in the hands of the transferee shall be treated as having been allowable with respect to the transferee in the same taxable year they were allowable to the transferor, and
(iii) If the taxable years of the transferor and transferee regularly end on different dates, then the aggregate of such deductions allowable for taxable year with respect to the transferor shall be treated in the hands of the transferee as allowable in the transferee's taxable year in which the taxable year of the transferor regularly ends.
(2)
Certain partially tax-free transfers.
If farm recapture property which is land is disposed of in a transaction which either is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, or is a partially tax-free transfer to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, then for purposes of section 1251:
(i) The amount determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) to the extent such gain is attributable to the sections 175 and 182 deductions for the taxable year and the preceding four taxable years (determined by attributing gain under section 1252(a) to the oldest years first) by the transferor upon the disposition, and
(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of such gain recognized under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) shall reduce the aggregate of deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 for the taxable year and each of the preceding four taxable years on a pro rata basis.

# Example 1.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Therefore, on the date B receives the land in the gift transaction, under subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, the aggregate of the deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land in the hands of B is the amount in the hands of A, $24,000, and for purposes of applying section 1251 upon a subsequent disposition by B (including the computation of potential gain) such deductions in the hands of B shall be treated as allowable in the same year as they were allowable to A. Thus, in respect to the land in the hands of B, the allowable section 175 and 182 deductions of $3,000 shall be treated as allowable in 1975.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) of Paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Under paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the aggregate of the allowable sections 175 and 182 deductions with respect to the land which pass over to B for purposes of section 1251 is zero ($3,000 deduction allowable under sections 175 and 182 for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years minus $3,000 gain taken into account by A in accordance with example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section).

§ 1.1252-1
General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of farm land.
(a)
Ordinary income
—(1)
General rule.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.1252-2, if farm land is disposed of during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, then under section 1252(a)(1) there shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income) the lower of:
(
a
) The applicable percentage of the amount computed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, or
(
b
) The amount computed in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) The amount computed in this subdivision is an amount equal to:
(
a
) The aggregate of the deductions allowed, in any taxable year any day of which falls within the period the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the farm land, under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation expenditures) and 182 (relating to expenditures by farmers for clearing land) for expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, with respect to the farm land disposed of, minus
(
b
) The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (relating to gain from disposition of property used in farming where farm losses offset nonfarm income) upon such disposition of such land.
(iii) The amount computed in this subdivision is an amount equal to:
(
a
) The gain realized, that is, the excess of the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) or the fair market value of the farm land (in the case of any other disposition), over the adjusted basis of the farm land, minus
(
b
) The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) upon such disposition of such land.
(iv) If a deduction under section 175 is allowed in respect of the farm land disposed of for a taxable year every day of which falls within the period after the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the farm land, and if the deduction is attributable to expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, with respect to such land during the period the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the land, then the amount of such deduction shall be applied to increase the amount computed (without regard to this subdivision) under subdivision (ii)(
a
) of this subparagraph.
(2)
Application of section.
Any gain treated as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall be recognized as ordinary income notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. For special rules with respect to the application of section 1252, see § 1.1252-2. For the relation of section 1252 to other provisions see paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Meaning of terms.
For purposes of section 1252:
(i) The term
farm land
means any land with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 175 or 182. See section 1252(a)(2).
(ii) The period for which farm land shall be considered to be held shall be determined under section 1223.
(iii) The term
disposition
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1245-1.
(iv) The applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:
If the farm land is disposed of—
The applicable
percentage is—
Within 5 years after the date it was acquired
100 percent.
Within the sixth year after it was acquired
80 percent.
Within the seventh year after it was acquired
60 percent.
Within the eighth year after it was acquired.
40 percent.
Within the ninth year after it was acquired.
20 percent.
Within the 10th year after it was acquired and thereafter.
0 percent.
(4)
Portion of parcel.
The amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall be determined separately for each parcel of farm land in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraphs (4) and (5) of § 1.1245-1(a) (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property). If (i) only a portion of a parcel of farm land is disposed of in a transaction, or if two or more portions of a single parcel are disposed of in one transaction, and (ii) the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 with respect to any such portion cannot be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, then the aggregate of the deductions in respect of the entire parcel shall be allocated to each portion in proportion to the fair market value of each at the time of the disposition.
(b)
Instances of non-application
—(1)
In general.
Section 1252 does not apply if a taxpayer disposes of farm land for which the holding period is in excess of 9 years or with respect to which no deductions have been allowed under sections 175 and 182.
(2)
Losses.
Section 1252(a)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1252(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is farm land, nor does the section apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(c)
Treatment of partnerships and partners.
[Reserved]
(d)
Relation of section 1252 to other provisions
—(1)
General.
The provisions of section 1252 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under § 1.1252-2 applies, gain under section 1252(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1252 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1252(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm land will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if
any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (1) of paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Nonrecognition sections overridden.
The nonrecognition of gain provisions of subtitle A of the Code which section 1252 overrides include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, and 512(b)(5). See § 1.1252-2 for the extent to which section 1252(a)(1) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721, 731, 1031, and 1033.
(3)
Installment method.
Gain from a disposition to which section 1252(a)(1) applies may be reported under the installment method if such method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such case, the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall (i) first be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1251(c)(1) applies (if applicable) until all such gain has been reported, (ii) the next portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1252(a)(1) applies until all such gain has been reported, and (iii) finally the remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which neither section 1251(c)(1) nor 1252(a)(1) applies. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483.
(4)
Exempt income.
With regard to exempt income, the principles of paragraph (e) of § 1.1245-6 shall be applicable.
(5)
Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1252(a)(1).
For treatment of gain not recognized under this section, the principles of paragraph (f) of § 1.1245-6 shall be applicable.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Individual A uses the calendar year as his taxable year. On April 10, 1975, he sells for $75,000 a parcel of farm land which he had acquired on January 5, 1970, with an adjusted basis of $52,500 for a realized gain of $22,500. The aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 with respect to such land is $18,000 and all of such amount was allowed for 1970. Under the stated facts, none of the $22,500 gain realized is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) as there is no potential gain (as defined in section 1251(e)(5)) with respect to the farm land. Since no gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), and since the applicable percentage, 80 percent, of the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182, $18,000, or $14,400, is lower than the gain realized, $22,500, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) is $14,400. The remaining $8,100 of the gain may be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) of paragraph (b)(6) of § 1.1251-1. Assume further that the aggregate of the amount of sections 175 and 182 deductions allowable to the M corporation is equal to the amount allowed. Under paragraph (a)(1) of the section, $5,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) upon the disposition of the land as a dividend, computed as follows:
(1) Aggregate of deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182
$18,000
(2) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
$13,000
(3) Difference
$5,000
(4) Multiply: Applicable percentage for property disposed of within the fifth year after it was acquired
100%
(5) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
a
) of this section
$5,000
(6) Gain realized (fair market value $67,500, less adjusted basis, $45,000)
$22,500
(7) Minus: Amount in line (2)
$13,000
(8) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section
$9,500
(9) Lower of line (5) or line (8)
$5,000
The
gain realized,
$22,500, minus the sum of the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $13,000, and under section 1252(a)(1), $5,000, equals $4,500. Assuming section 311(d) (relating to certain distributions of appreciated property to redeem stock) does not apply, under section 311(a) the corporation does not recognize gain on account of the $4,500.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) of this paragraph, except that M contracted to sell the land for $67,500 which would be paid in 10 equal payments of $6,750 each, plus a sufficient amount of interest so that section 483 does not apply. Assume further that the remaining gain of $4,500 is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property described in section 1231. M properly elects under section 453 to report under the installment method gain of $13,000 to which section 1251(c)(1) applies, gain of $5,000 to which section 1252(a)(1) applies, and gain of $4,500 to which section 1231 applies. Since the total gain realized on the sale was
$22,500, the gross profit realized on each installment payment is $2,250, i.e., $6,750 × ($67,500). Accordingly, the treatment of the income to be reported on each installment payment is as follows:

§ 1.1252-2
Special rules.
(a)
Exception for gifts
—(1)
General rule.
In general, no gain shall be recognized under section 1252(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm land by gift. For purposes of section 1252 and this paragraph, the term
gift
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of farm land, see section 170(e) and § 1.170A-4.
(2)
Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.
Where a disposition of farm land is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the amount of gain which shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall be computed under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1252-1, applied by treating the gain realized (for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(
a
) of § 1.1252-1) as the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the farm land.
(3)
Treatment of farm land in hands of transferee.
See paragraph (f) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 2, 1976, A, a calendar year taxpayer, makes a gift to B of a parcel of land having an adjusted basis of $40,000, a fair market value of $65,000, and a holding period of 6 years (A, having purchased the land on January 15, 1971). On the date of such gift, the aggregate of the deductions allowed to A under sections 175 and 182 with respect to the land is $24,000 with $21,000 of such amount attributable to 1971. Upon making the gift, A recognizes no gain under section 1251(c)(1) or section 1252(a)(1). See paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1251-4 and subparagraph 1 of this paragraph. For treatment of the farm land in the hands of B, see example (1) of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. For effect of the gift on the excess deductions accounts of A and of B, see paragraph (e)(2) of § 1.1251-2.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that A transfers the land to B for $50,000. Thus, the gain realized is $10,000 (amount realized, $50,000, minus adjusted basis, $40,000), and A has made a gift of $15,000 (fair market value, $65,000, minus amount realized, $50,000).
(ii) Upon the transfer of the land to B, A recognizes $3,000 of gain under section 1251(c)(1). See example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.1251-4. Thus, A recognizes $7,000 as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1), computed under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as follows:
(1) Aggregate of deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182
$24,000
(2) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
$3,000
(3) Difference
$21,000
(4) Multiply: Applicable percentage for land disposed of within sixth year after it was acquired
80%
(5) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
a
) of § 1.1252-1
$16,800
(6) Gain realized (see subdivision (i) of this example)
$10,000
(7) Minus: Amount in line (2)
$3,000
(8) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
) of § 1.1252-1, applied in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph
$7,000
(9) Lower of line (5) or line (8)
$7,000
Thus, the entire gain realized on the transfer, $10,000, is recognized as ordinary income since that amount is equal to the sum of the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $3,000, and under section 1252(a)(1), $7,000. For treatment of the farm land in the hands of B, see example (2) of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(b)
Exception for transfers at death
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1252(a)(1) upon a
transfer at death. For purposes of section 1252 and this paragraph, the term
transfer at death
shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply.
(2)
Treatment of farm land in hands of transferee.
If as of the date a person acquires farm land from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternative valuation date), then on such date the aggregate of the sections 175 and 182 deductions allowed with respect to the farm land in the hands of such transferee is zero.
(c)
Limitation for certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
Limitation on amount of gain.
Upon a transfer of farm land described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1252) over (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). For purposes of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, in the case of a transfer of farm land and property other than farm land in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the farm land (as determined in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1) shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the farm land bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1252) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1). The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Transfers covered.
The transfers referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are transfers of farm land in which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to such a complete liquidation, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, for example, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply to a liquidating distribution of farm land by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.
(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).
(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).
(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).
(vi) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest). See paragraph (e) of this section.
(vii) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For special carryover of basis rule, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of farm land in the hands of tranferee.
See paragraph (f) of this section for treatment of the transferee in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 4, 1975, A, an individual calendar year taxpayer, owns a parcel of farm land, which he acquired on March 25,
1970, having an adjusted basis of $15,000 and a fair market value of $40,000. On that date he transfers the parcel to corporation M in exchange for stock in the corporation worth $40,000 in a transaction qualifying under section 351. On the date of such transfer, the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 with respect to the land is $18,000. Without regard to section 1252, A would recognize no gain under section 351 upon the transfer and M's basis for the land would be determined under section 362(a) by reference to its basis in the hands of A. Thus, as a result of the disposition, no gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) or section 1252(a)(1) by A since the amount of gain recognized under such sections is limited to the amount of gain which is recognized under section 351 (determined without regard to sections 1251 and 1252). See paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1251-4 and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For treatment of the farm land in the hands of B, see paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For effect of the transfer on the excess deductions account of A and of B, see paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1251-2.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts in example (1), except that A transferred the land to M for stock in the corporation worth $32,000 and $8,000 cash. The gain realized is $25,000 (amount realized, $40,000, minus adjusted basis, $15,000). Without regard to section 1252, A would recognize $8,000 of gain under section 351(b). Assume further that no gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). Therefore, since the applicable percentage, 100 percent, of the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182, $18,000, is lower than the gain realized, $25,000, the amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) would be $18,000 if the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply. Since under section 351(b) gain in the amount of $8,000 would be recognized to the transferor without regard to section 1252, the limitation provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph limits the gain taken into account by A under section 1252(a)(1) to $8,000.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that $5,000 of gain is recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) is $3,000 computed as follows:
(1) Amount of gain under section 1252(a)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph):
(a) Aggregate of deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182
$18,000
(b) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
$5,000
(c) Difference
$13,000
(d) Multiply: Applicable percentage for property disposed of within the fifth year after it was acquired
100%
(e) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
a
) of § 1.1252-1
$13,000
(f) Gain realized (amount realized $40,000, less adjusted basis, $15,000)
$25,000
(g) Minus: Amount in line (b)
$5,000
(h) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
) of § 1.1252-1
$20,000
(i) Lower of line (e) or (h)
$13,000
(2) Limitation in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
(a) Gain recognized (determined without regard to section 1252)
$8,000
(b) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
$5,000
(c) Difference
$3,000
(3) Lower of line (1)(i) or line (2)(c)
$3,000
Thus, the entire gain recognized under section 351(b) (determined without regard to sections 1251 and 1252), $8,000, is recognized as ordinary income since that amount is equal to the sum of the gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), $5,000, and under section 1252(a)(1), $3,000.
(d)
Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions
—(1)
General rule.
If farm land is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1252) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1252(a)(1) shall not exceed the sum of:
(i) The excess (if any) of (
a
) the amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1252) over (
b
) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1), plus
(ii) The fair market value of property acquired which is not farm land and which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (that is, the fair market value of property other than farm land acquired which is qualifying property under section 1031 or 1033, as the case may be).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Assume the same facts as in example (2)(ii) of paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.1251-4. Assume further that the aggregate of the amount of sections 175 and 182 deductions allowable is equal to the amount allowed. Under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1252-1, $18,000
would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), computed as follows:
(1) Aggregate of deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182
$18,000
(2) Minus: Gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1)
0
(3) Difference
$18,000
(4) Multiply: Applicable percentage for property disposed of within the fifth year after it was acquired
100%
(5) Amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
a

(ii) Although no gain was recognized under section 1251(c)(1) and the stock purchased by A for $67,500 is farm recapture property for purposes of section 1251, it is not farm land for purposes of section 1252. Nevertheless, although no gain would be recognized under sections 1033(a)(3) and 1251(c)(1) (determined without regard to section 1252), the limitation under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is $67,500 (that is, the fair market value of property other than farm land acquired which is qualifying property under section 1033). Since the amount of gain which would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) (determined without regard to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), $18,000 (as computed in subdivision (i) of this example), is lower than the amount of such limitation, $67,500, accordingly, only $18,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1). For determination of basis of the stock acquired, see subparagraph (5) of this paragraph.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in example (1) of this subparagraph, except that the cost of the stock was $62,500 (its fair market value). Thus, the amount of gain recognized on the disposition under section 1033(a)(3) (determined without regard to sections 1251 and 1252) is $5,000, that is, $67,500 minus $62,500. Assume further that $5,000 (the amount of gain recognized under section 1033(a)(3) (so determined)) was recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) is $13,000, computed as follows:

Application to single disposition of farm land and property of different class.
(i) If upon a sale of farm land gain would be recognized under section 1252(a)(1), and if such land together with property of a different class or classes is disposed of in one transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or 1033 (without regard to section 1252(a)(1)), then rules consistent with the principles of paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable realty) shall apply for purposes of allocating the amount realized to each of the classes of property disposed of and for purposes of determining what property the amount realized for each class consists of.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of property other than farm recapture property (as defined in section 1251(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1251-3) are (
a
) section 1245 property, (
b
) section 1250 property, and (
c
) other property.
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of farm recapture property are (
a
) land, (
b
) section 1245 property, and (
c
) other property.

Treatment of farm land received in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.
The aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of land acquired in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall include the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land transferred or converted (as the cr sections 175 and 182 in respect of land acquired in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall include the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land transferred or converted (as the case may be) in such transaction minus the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) with respect to the land transferred or converted. Upon a subsequent disposition of such land, the holding period shall include the holding period with respect to the land transferred or converted.
(5)
Basis adjustment.
In order to reflect gain recognized under section 1252(a)(1) if property is acquired in a transaction to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, its basis shall be determined under the rules of section 1031(d) or 1033(c).

Treatment of farm land received by a transferee in a disposition by gift and certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General rule.
If farm land is disposed of in a transaction which is either a gift to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies, or a completely tax-free transfer to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies, then for purposes of section 1252:
(i) The aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land in the hands of the tranferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to the amount of such aggregate in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, and
(ii) For purposes of applying section 1252 upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee (including a computation of the applicable percentage), the holding period of the transferee shall include the holding period of the transferor.
(2)
Certain partially tax-free transfers.
If farm land is disposed of in a transaction which either is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift to which paragraph (a)(2)of this section applies, or is a partially tax-free transfer to which paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies, then for purposes of section 1252 the amount determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shallbe reduced by the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) by the transferor upon the disposition. Upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee, the holding period for purposes of computing the amount under section 1252(a)(1)(A), with respect to the 175 and 182 deductions taken by the transferor, shall include the holding period of the transferor. With respect to the 1975 and 182 deductions taken by the transferee, the holding period shall not include the holding period of the transferor.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Therefore, on the date B receives the farm land in the gift transaction, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the farm land in the hands of B is the amount in the hands of A, $24,000, and for purposes of applying section 1252 upon a subsequent disposition by B (including a computation of the applicable percentage) the holding period of B includes the holding period of A.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the aggregate of the sections 175 and 182 deductions which pass over to B for purposes of section 1252 is $14,000 ($24,000 deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 minus $3,000 gain recognized under section 1251(c) in accordance with example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.1251-4, minus $7,000 gain recognized under section 1252(a) in acordance with example (2) of paragraph (a)(4) of this section), B's holding period includes the holding period of A (i.e., the period back to January 15, 1971) with respect to A's deductions.
(g)
Disposition of farm land not specifically covered.
If farm land is disposed of in a transaction not specifically covered under § 1.1252-1 and this section,
then the principles of section 1245 shall apply.

§ 1.1254-1
Treatment of gain from disposition of natural resource recapture property.
(a)
In general.
Upon any disposition of section 1254 property or any disposition after December 31, 1975 of oil, gas, or geothermal property, gain is treated as ordinary income in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the section 1254 costs (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) with respect to the property, or the amount, if any, by which the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, or the fair market value of the property on any other disposition, exceeds the adjusted basis of the property. However, any amount treated as ordinary income under the preceding sentence is not included in the taxpayer's
gross income from the property
for purposes of section 613. Generally, the lesser of the amounts described in this paragraph (a) is treated as ordinary income even though, in the absence of section 1254(a), no gain would be recognized upon the disposition under any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code. For the definition of the term
section 1254 costs,
see paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For the definition of the terms
section 1254 property, oil, gas, or geothermal property,
and
natural resource recapture property,
see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For rules relating to the
disposition
of natural resource recapture property, see paragraphs (b)(3), (c), and (d) of this section. For exceptions and limitations to the application of section 1254(a), see § 1.1254-2.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Section 1254 costs
—(i)
Property placed in service after December 31, 1986.
With respect to any property placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986, the term
section 1254 costs
means—
(A) The aggregate amount of expenditures that have been deducted by the taxpayer or any person under section 263, 616, or 617 with respect to such property and that, but for the deduction, would have been included in the adjusted basis of the property or in the adjusted basis of certain depreciable property associated with the property; and
(B) The deductions for depletion under section 611 that reduced the adjusted basis of the property.
(ii)
Property placed in service before January 1, 1987.
With respect to any property placed in service by the taxpayer before January 1, 1987, the term
section 1254 costs
means—
(A) The aggregate amount of costs paid or incurred after December 31, 1975, with respect to such property, that have been deducted as intangible drilling and development costs under section 263(c) by the taxpayer or any other person (except that section 1254 costs do not include costs incurred with respect to geothermal wells commenced before October 1, 1978) and that, but for the deduction, would be reflected in the adjusted basis of the property or in the adjusted basis of certain depreciable property associated with the property; reduced by
(B) The amount (if any) by which the deduction for depletion allowed under section 611 that was computed either under section 612 or sections 613 and 613A, with respect to the property, would have been increased if the costs (paid or incurred after December 31, 1975) had been charged to capital account rather than deducted.
(iii)
Deductions under section 59 and section 291.
Amounts capitalized pursuant to an election under section 59(e) or pursuant to section 291(b) are treated as section 1254 costs in the year in which an amortization deduction is claimed under section 59(e)(1) or section 291(b)(2).
(iv)
Suspended deductions.
If a deduction of a section 1254 cost has been suspended as of the date of disposition of section 1254 property, the deduction is not treated as a section 1254 cost if it is included in basis for determining gain or loss on the disposition. On the other hand, if the deduction will eventually be claimed, it is a section 1254 cost as of the date of disposition. For example, a deduction suspended pursuant to the 65 percent of taxable income limitation
of section 613A(d)(1) may either be included in basis upon disposition of the property or may be deducted in a year after the year of disposition. See § 1.613A-4(a)(1). If it is included in the basis then it is not a section 1254 cost, but if it is deductible in a later year it is a section 1254 cost as of the date of the disposition.
(v)
Previously recaptured amounts.
If an amount has been previously treated as ordinary income pursuant to section 1254, it is not a section 1254 cost.
(vi)
Nonproductive wells.
The aggregate amount of section 1254 costs paid or incurred on any property includes the amount of intangible drilling and development costs incurred on nonproductive wells, but only to the extent that the taxpayer recognizes income on the foreclosure of a nonrecourse debt the proceeds from which were used to finance the section 1254 costs with respect to the property. For this purpose, the term nonproductive well means a well that does not produce oil or gas in commercial quantities, including a well that is drilled for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, or extent of an oil or gas reservoir (e.g., a delineation well). The term
nonproductive well
does not include an injection well (other than an injection well drilled as part of a project that does not result in production in commercial quantities).
(vii)
Calculation of amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (hypothetical depletion offset)
—(A)
In general.
In calculating the amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the taxpayer shall apply the following rules. The taxpayer may use the 65-percent-of-taxable-income limitation of section 613A(d)(1). If the taxpayer uses that limitation, the taxpayer is not required to recalculate the effect of such limitation with respect to any property not disposed of. That is, the taxpayer may assume that the hypothetical capitalization of intangible drilling and development costs with respect to any property disposed of does not affect the allowable depletion with respect to property retained by the taxpayer. Any intangible drilling and development costs that, if they had not been treated as expenses under section 263(c), would have properly been capitalized under § 1.612-4(b)(2) (relating to items recoverable through depreciation under section 167 or cost recovery under section 168) are treated as costs described in § 1.612-4(b)(1) (relating to items recoverable through depletion). The increase in depletion attributable to the capitalization of intangible drilling and development costs is computed by subtracting the amount of cost or percentage depletion actually claimed from the amount of cost or percentage depletion that would have been allowable if intangible drilling and development costs had been capitalized. If the remainder is zero or less than zero, the entire amount of intangible drilling and development costs attributable to the property is recapturable.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A).

# Example: Hypothetical depletion offset.
In 1976, A purchased undeveloped property for $10,000. During 1977, A incurred $200,000 of productive well intangible drilling and development costs with respect to the property. A deducted the intangible drilling and development costs as expenses under section 263(c). Estimated reserves of 150,000 barrels of recoverable oil were discovered in 1977 and production began in 1978. In 1978, A produced and sold 30,000 barrels of oil at $8 per barrel, resulting in $240,000 of gross income. A had no other oil or gas production in 1978. A claimed a percentage depletion deduction of $52,800 (i.e., 22% of $240,000 gross income from the property). If A had capitalized the intangible drilling and development costs, assume that $200,000 of the costs would have been allocated to the depletable property and none to depreciable property. A's cost depletion deduction if the intangible drilling and development costs had been capitalized would have been $42,000 (i.e., (($200,000 intangible drilling and development costs + $10,000 acquisition costs) × 30,000 barrels of production)/ 150,000 barrels of estimated recoverable reserves). Since this amount is less than A's depletion deduction of $52,800 (percentage depletion), no reduction is made to the amount of intangible drilling and development costs ($200,000). On January 1, 1979, A sold the oil property to B for $360,000 and calculated section 1254 recapture without reference to the 65-percent-of-taxable-income limitation. A's gain on the sale is the entire $360,000, because A's basis in the property at the beginning of 1979 is zero (i.e., $10,000 cost less $52,800 depletion deduction for 1978). Since the section 1254 costs ($200,000) are less than
A's gain on the sale, $200,000 is treated as ordinary income under section 1254(a). The remaining amount of A's gain ($160,000) is not subject to section 1254(a).
(2)
Natural resource recapture property
—(i)
In general.
The term
natural resource recapture property
means section 1254 property or oil, gas, or geothermal property as those terms are defined in this section.
(ii)
Section 1254 property.
The term
section 1254 property
means any property (within the meaning of section 614) that is placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986, if any expenditures described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section (relating to costs under section 263, 616, or 617) are properly chargeable to such property, or if the adjusted basis of such property includes adjustments for deductions for depletion under section 611.
(iii)
Oil, gas, or geothermal property.
The term
oil, gas, or geothermal property
means any property (within the meaning of section 614) that was placed in service by the taxpayer before January 1, 1987, if any expenditures described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section are properly chargeable to such property.
(iv)
Property to which section 1254 costs are properly chargeable.
(A) An expenditure is properly chargeable to property if—
(
1
) The property is an operating mineral interest with respect to which the expenditure has been deducted;
(
2
) The property is a nonoperating mineral interest (e.g., a net profits interest or an overriding royalty interest) burdening an operating mineral interest if the nonoperating mineral interest is carved out of an operating mineral interest described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section;
(
3
) The property is a nonoperating mineral interest retained by a lessor or sublessor if such lessor or sublessor held, prior to the lease or sublease, an operating mineral interest described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section; or
(
4
) The property is an operating or a nonoperating mineral interest held by a taxpayer if a party related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) held an operating mineral interest (described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section) in the same tract or parcel of land that terminated (in whole or in part) without being disposed of (e.g., a working interest which terminated after a specified period of time or a given amount of production), but only if there exists between the related parties an arrangement or plan to avoid recapture under section 1254. In such a case, the taxpayer's section 1254 costs with respect to the property include those of the related party.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (2)(iv)(A)(
4
) of this section:

# Example: Arrangement or plan to avoid recapture.
C, an individual, owns 100% of the stock of both X Co. and Y Co. On January 1, 1998, X Co. enters into a standard oil and gas lease. X Co. immediately assigns to Y Co. 1% of the working interest for one year, and 99% of the working interest thereafter. In 1998, X Co. and Y Co. expend $300 in intangible drilling and development costs developing the tract, of which $297 are deducted by X Co. under section 263(c). On January 1, 1999, Y Co. sells its 99% share of the working interest to an unrelated person. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the arrangement between X Co. and Y Co. is part of a plan or arrangement to avoid recapture under section 1254. Therefore, Y Co. must include in its section 1254 costs the $297 of intangible drilling and development costs deducted by X Co.
(v)
Property the basis of which includes adjustments for depletion deductions.
The adjusted basis of property includes adjustments for depletion under section 611 if—
(A) The basis of the property has been reduced by reason of depletion deductions; or
(B) The property has been carved out of or is a portion of property the basis of which has been reduced by reason of depletion deductions.
(vi)
Property held by a transferee.
Property held by a transferee is natural resource recapture property if the property was natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferor and the transferee's basis in the property is determined with reference to the transferor's basis in the property (e.g., a gift) or is determined under section 732.
(vii)
Property held by a transferor.
Property held by a transferor of natural resource recapture property is natural resource recapture property if the transferor's basis in the property received is determined with reference to the transferor's basis in the property transferred by the transferor (e.g., a like kind exchange). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), property described in this paragraph (b)(2)(vii) is treated as placed in service at the time the property transferred by the transferor was placed in service by the transferor.
(3)
Disposition
—(i)
General rule.
The term
disposition
has the same meaning as in section 1245, relating to gain from dispositions of certain depreciable property.
(ii)
Exceptions.
The term
disposition
does not include—
(A) Any transaction that is merely a financing device, such as a mortgage or a production payment that is treated as a loan under section 636 and the regulations thereunder;
(B) Any abandonment (except that an abandonment is a disposition to the extent the taxpayer recognizes income on the foreclosure of a nonrecourse debt);
(C) Any creation of a lease or sublease of natural resource recapture property;
(D) Any termination or election of the status of an S corporation;
(E) Any unitization or pooling arrangement;
(F) Any expiration or reversion of an operating mineral interest that expires or reverts by its own terms, in whole or in part; or
(G) Any conversion of an overriding royalty interest that, at the option of the grantor or successor in interest, converts to an operating mineral interest after a certain amount of production.
(iii)
Special rule for carrying arrangements.
In a carrying arrangement, liability for section 1254 costs attributable to the entire operating mineral interest held by the carrying party prior to reversion or conversion remains attributable to the reduced operating mineral interest retained by the carrying party after a portion of the operating mineral interest has reverted to the carried party or after the conversion of an overriding royalty interest that, at the option of the grantor or successor in interest, converts to an operating mineral interest after a certain amount of production.
(c)
Disposition of a portion of natural resource recapture property
—(1)
Disposition of a portion (other than an undivided interest) of natural resource recapture property
—(i)
Natural resource recapture property subject to the general rules of § 1.1254-1.
For purposes of section 1254(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (c) (1)(ii) and (3) of this section, in the case of the disposition of a portion (that is not an undivided interest) of natural resource recapture property, the entire amount of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property is treated as allocable to that portion of the property to the extent of the amount of gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies. If the amount of the gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies is less than the amount of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property, the balance of the section 1254 costs remaining after allocation to the portion of the property that was disposed of remains subject to recapture by the taxpayer under section 1254(a)(1) upon disposition of the remaining portion of the property. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which A has deducted intangible drilling and development costs under section 263(c). If A sells the north 40 acres, the entire amount of the section 1254 costs with respect to the 80-acre tract is treated as allocable to the 40-acre portion sold (to the extent of the amount of gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies).
(ii)
Natural resource recapture property subject to the exceptions and limitations of § 1.1254-2.
For purposes of section 1254(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in the case of the disposition of a portion (that is not an undivided interest) of natural resource recapture property to which section 1254(a)(1) does not apply by reason of the application of § 1.1254-2 (certain nonrecognition transactions), the following rule for allocation of costs applies. An amount of the section 1254
costs that bears the same ratio to the entire amount of such costs with respect to the entire natural resource recapture property as the value of the property transferred bears to the value of the entire natural resource recapture property is treated as allocable to the portion of the natural resource recapture property transferred. The balance of the section 1254 costs remaining after allocation to that portion of the transferred property remains subject to recapture by the taxpayer under section 1254(a)(1) upon disposition of the remaining portion of the property. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which A has deducted intangible drilling and development costs under section 263(c). If A gives away the north 40 acres, and if 60 percent of the value of the 80-acre tract were attributable to the north 40 acres given away, 60 percent of the section 1254 costs with respect to the 80-acre tract is allocable to the north 40 acres given away.
(2)
Disposition of an undivided interest
—(i)
Natural resource recapture property subject to the general rules of § 1.1254-1.
For purposes of section 1254(a)(1), except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section, in the case of the disposition of an undivided interest in natural resource recapture property (or a portion thereof), a proportionate part of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property is treated as allocable to the transferred undivided interest to the extent of the amount of gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which A has deducted intangible drilling and development costs under section 263(c). If A sells an undivided 40 percent interest in the 80-acre tract, 40 percent of the section 1254 costs with respect to the 80-acre tract is allocable to the transferred 40 percent interest in the 80-acre tract. However, if the amount of gain recognized on the sale of the 40 percent undivided interest were equal to only 35 percent of the amount of section 1254 costs attributable to the 80-acre tract, only 35 percent of the section 1254 costs would be treated as attributable to the undivided 40 percent interest. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for an alternative allocation rule.
(ii)
Natural resource recapture property subject to the exceptions and limitations of § 1.1254-2.
For purposes of section 1254(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in the case of a disposition of an undivided interest in natural resource recapture property (or a portion thereof) to which section 1254 (a)(1) does not apply by reason of § 1.1254-2, a proportionate part of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property is treated as allocable to the transferred undivided interest. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for an alternative allocation rule.
(3)
Alternative allocation rule
—(i)
In general.
The rules for the allocation of costs set forth in section 1254(a)(2) and paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section do not apply with respect to section 1254 costs that the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner do not relate to the transferred property. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a taxpayer may satisfy this requirement only by receiving a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the section 1254 costs do not relate to the transferred property.
(ii)
Portion of property.
Upon the transfer of a portion of a natural resource recapture property (other than an undivided interest) with respect to which section 1254 costs have been incurred, a taxpayer may treat section 1254 costs as not relating to the transferred portion if the transferred portion does not include any part of any deposit with respect to which the costs were incurred.
(iii)
Undivided interest.
Upon the transfer of an undivided interest in a natural resource recapture property with respect to which section 1254 costs have been incurred, a taxpayer may treat costs as not relating to the transferred interest if the undivided interest is an undivided interest in a portion of the natural resource recapture property, and the portion would be eligible for the alternative allocation rule under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Substantiation.
If a taxpayer treats section 1254 costs incurred with respect to a natural resource recapture property as not relating to a transferred interest in a portion of the property, the taxpayer must indicate on his or her tax return that the costs do not relate to the transferred portion and maintain the records and supporting evidence that substantiate this position.
(d)
Installment method.
Gain from a disposition to which section 1254(a)(1) applies is reported on the installment method if that method otherwise applies under section 453 or 453A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. The portion of each installment payment as reported that represents income (other than interest) is treated as gain to which section 1254(a)(1) applies until all of the gain (to which section 1254(a)(1) applies) has been reported, and the remaining portion (if any) of the income is then treated as gain to which section 1254(a)(1) does not apply. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see sections 483, 1274, and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 8586, 60 FR 2502, Jan. 10, 1995]
§ 1.1254-2
Exceptions and limitations.
(a)
Exception for gifts and section 1041 transfers
—(1)
General rule.
No gain is recognized under section 1254(a)(1) upon a disposition of natural resource recapture property by a gift or by a transfer in which no gain or loss is recognized pursuant to section 1041 (relating to transfers between spouses). For purposes of this paragraph (a), the term
gift
means, except to the extent that paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, a transfer of natural resource recapture property that, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1015(a) or 1015(d) (relating to basis of property acquired by gift) or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010). For rules concerning the potential reduction in the amount of the charitable contribution in the case of natural resource recapture property, see section 170(e) and § 1.170A-4. See § 1.1254-3(b)(1) for determination of potential recapture of section 1254 costs on property acquired by gift. See § 1.1254-1 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii) for apportionment of section 1254 costs on a gift of a portion of natural resource recapture property.
(2)
Part gift transactions.
If a disposition of natural resource recapture property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the gain that is treated as ordinary income pursuant to section 1254(a)(1) is the lower of the section 1254 costs with respect to the property or the excess of the amount realized upon the disposition of the property over the adjusted basis of the property. In the case of a transfer subject to section 1011(b) (relating to bargain sales to charitable organizations), the adjusted basis for purposes of the preceding sentence is the adjusted basis for determining gain or loss under section 1011(b).
(b)
Exception for transfers at death.
Except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain is recognized under section 1254(a)(1) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
transfer at death
means a transfer of natural resource recapture property that, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1014(a) (relating to basis of property acquired from a decedent) because of the death of the transferor. See § 1.1254-3 (a)(4) and (c) for the determination of potential recapture of section 1254 costs on property acquired in a transfer at death.
(c)
Limitation for certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General rule.
Upon a transfer of property described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of gain treated as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1254(a)(1) may not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1254). In the case of a transfer of both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the natural resource recapture property is deemed to be equal to the amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount realized as the fair market value of the natural resource recapture property bears to the
aggregate fair market value of all the property transferred. The preceding sentence is applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1254) that may be recognized as ordinary income under section 1254(a)(1).
(2)
Special rule for dispositions to certain tax-exempt organizations.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a disposition of natural resource recapture property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) that is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code. The preceding sentence does not apply to a disposition of natural resource recapture property to an organization described in section 511 (a)(2) or (b)(2) (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc., organizations) if, immediately after the disposition, the organization uses the property in an unrelated trade or business as defined in section 513. If any property with respect to which gain is not recognized by reason of the exception of this paragraph (c)(2) ceases to be used in an unrelated trade or business of the organization acquiring the property, that organization is, for purposes of section 1254, treated as having disposed of the property on the date of the cessation.
(3)
Transfers described.
The transfers referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are transfers of natural resource recapture property in which the basis of the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(i) Section 332 (relating to certain liquidations of subsidiaries). See paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).
(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(iv) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest).
(v) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For purposes of this paragraph, the basis of natural resource recapture property distributed by a partnership to a partner is deemed to be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership.
(4)
Special rules for section 332 transfers.
In the case of a distribution in complete liquidation of a subsidiary to which section 332 applies, the limitation provided in this paragraph (c) is confined to instances in which the basis of the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferee is determined, under section 334(b)(1), by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor. Thus, for example, the limitation may apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary corporation to the parent corporation, but does not apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property to a minority shareholder. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a liquidating distribution of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined under section 334(b)(2) (as in effect before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a liquidating distribution under section 332 of natural resource recapture property by a subsidiary to its parent if gain is recognized and there is a corresponding increase in the parent's basis in the property (e.g., certain distributions to a tax-exempt or foreign corporation).
(d)
Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions
—(1)
General rule.
If natural resource recapture property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1254) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1254(a)(1) may not exceed the sum of—
(i) The amount of gain recognized on the disposition (determined without regard to section 1254); plus
(ii) The fair market value of property acquired that is not natural resource recapture property (determined without regard to § 1.1254-1(b)(2)(vii)) and is not taken into account under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (that is, qualifying property under section 1031 or 1033 that is not natural resource recapture property).
(2)
Disposition and acquisition of both natural resource recapture property and other property.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), if both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property are acquired as the result of one disposition in which both natural resource recapture property and property that is not natural resource recapture property are disposed of—
(i) The total amount realized upon the disposition is allocated between the natural resource recapture property and the property that is not natural resource recapture property disposed of in proportion to their respective fair market values;
(ii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the natural resource recapture property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the natural resource recapture property acquired as is not in excess of the amount realized from the natural resource recapture property disposed of, and the remaining portion (if any) of the amount realized upon the disposition of such property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the property that is not natural resource recapture property acquired as is not in excess of the remaining portion; and
(iii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the property that is not natural resource recapture property is deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of all the property acquired which was not taken into account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. Except as provided in section 1060 and the regulations thereunder, if a buyer and seller have adverse interests as to such allocation of the amount realized, any arm's-length agreement between the buyer and seller is used to establish the allocation. In the absence of such an agreement, the allocation is made by taking into account the appropriate facts and circumstances.
[T.D. 8586, 60 FR 2505, Jan. 10, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8684, 61 FR 53063, Oct. 10, 1996; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6241, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1254-3
Section 1254 costs immediately after certain acquisitions.
(a)
Transactions in which basis is determined by reference to cost or fair market value of property transferred
—(1)
Basis determined under section 1012.
If, on the date a person acquires natural resource recapture property, the person's basis for the property is determined solely by reference to its cost (within the meaning of section 1012), the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the person's hands is zero on the acquisition date.
(2)
Basis determined under section 301(d), 334(a), or 358(a)(2).
If, on the date a person acquires natural resource recapture property, the person's basis for the property is determined solely by reason of the application of section 301(d) (relating to basis of property received in a corporate distribution), section 334(a) (relating to basis of property received in a liquidation in which gain or loss is recognized), or section 358(a)(2) (relating to basis of other property received in certain exchanges), the amount of the section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the person's hands is zero on the acquisition date.
(3)
Basis determined solely under former section 334(b)(2) or former section 334(c).
If, on the date a person acquires natural resource recapture property, the person's basis for the property is determined solely under the provisions of section 334(b)(2) (prior to amendment of that section by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982) or (c) (prior to repeal of that section by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) (relating to basis of property received in certain corporate liquidations), the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the person's hands is zero on the acquisition date.
(4)
Basis determined by reason of the application of section 1014(a).
If, on the date a person acquires natural resource
recapture property from a decedent, the person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the person's hands is zero on the acquisition date. See paragraph (c) of this section for the treatment of certain transfers at death.
(b)
Gifts and certain tax-free transactions
—(1)
General rule.
If natural resource recapture property is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition is an amount equal to—
(i) The amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition (and in the case of an S corporation or partnership transferor, the section 1254 costs of the shareholders or partners with respect to the natural resource recapture property); minus
(ii) The amount of any gain taken into account as ordinary income under section 1254(a)(1) by the transferor upon the disposition (and in the case of an S corporation or partnership transferor, any such gain taken into account as ordinary income by the shareholders or partners).
(2)
Transactions covered.
The transactions to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply are—
(i) A disposition that is a gift or in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift;
(ii) A transaction described in section 1041(a);
(iii) A disposition described in § 1.1254-2(c)(3) (relating to certain tax-free transactions); or
(iv) A transfer at death where basis of property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022.
(c)
Certain transfers at death.
If natural resource recapture property is acquired in a transfer at death, the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer includes the amount, if any, of the section 1254 costs deducted by the transferee before the decedent's death, to the extent that the basis of the natural resource recapture property (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under the second sentence of section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis where the property is acquired from a decedent prior to death).
(d)
Property received in a like kind exchange or involuntary conversion
—(1)
General rule.
If natural resource recapture property is disposed of in a like kind exchange under section 1031 or involuntary conversion under section 1033, then immediately after the disposition the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to any natural resource recapture property acquired for the property transferred is an amount equal to—
(i) The amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property disposed of (including the section 1254 costs of the shareholders of an S corporation or of the partners of a partnership with respect to the natural resource recapture property); minus
(ii) The amount of any gain taken into account as ordinary income under section 1254(a)(1) by the transferor upon the disposition (and in the case of an S corporation or partnership transferor, any such gain taken into account as ordinary income by the shareholders or partners).
(2)
Allocation of section 1254 costs among multiple natural resource recapture properties acquired.
If more than one parcel of natural resource recapture property is acquired at the same time from the same person in a transaction referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the total amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the parcels is allocated to the parcels in proportion to their respective adjusted bases.
(e)
Property transferred in cases to which section 1071 or 1081(b) applies.
Rules similar to the rules of section 1245(b)(5) shall apply under section 1254.
[T.D. 8586, 60 FR 2506, Jan. 10, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8684, 61 FR 53063, Oct. 10, 1996; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6242, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1254-4
Special rules for S corporations and their shareholders.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for applying the provisions of section 1254 to S corporations and their shareholders upon the disposition by an S corporation (and a corporation that was formerly an S corporation) of natural resource recapture property and upon the disposition by a shareholder of stock of an S corporation that holds natural resource recapture property.
(b)
Determination of gain treated as ordinary income under section 1254 upon a disposition of natural resource recapture property by an S corporation
—(1)
General rule.
Upon a disposition of natural resource recapture property by an S corporation, the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 1254 is determined at the shareholder level. Each shareholder must recognize as ordinary income under section 1254 the lesser of—
(i) The shareholder's section 1254 costs with respect to the property disposed of; or
(ii) The shareholder's share of the amount, if any, by which the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, or the fair market value of the property upon any other disposition (including a distribution), exceeds the adjusted basis of the property.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:

# Example 1. Disposition of natural resource recapture property other than oil and gas property.
A and B are equal shareholders in X, an S corporation. On January 1, 1997, X acquires for $90,000 an undeveloped mineral property, its sole property. During 1997, X expends and deducts $100,000 in developing the property. On January 15, 1998, X sells the property for $250,000 when X's basis in the property is $90,000. Thus, X recognizes gain of $160,000 on the sale. A and B's share of the $160,000 gain recognized is $80,000 each. Each shareholder has $50,000 of section 1254 costs with respect to the property. Under these circumstances, A and B each are required to recognize $50,000 of the $80,000 of gain on the sale of the property as ordinary income under section 1254.

# Example 2. Disposition of oil and gas property the adjusted basis of which is allocated to the shareholders under section 613A(c)(11).
C and D are equal shareholders in Y, an S corporation. On January 1, 1997, Y acquires for $150,000 an undeveloped oil and gas property, its sole property. During 1997, Y expends in developing the property $40,000 in intangible drilling costs which it elects to expense under section 263(c). On January 15, 1998, Y sells the property for $200,000. C and D's share of the $200,000 amount realized on the sale is $100,000 each. C and D each have a basis of $75,000 in the property and $20,000 of section 1254 costs with respect to the property. Under these circumstances, C and D each are required to recognize $20,000 of the $25,000 gain on the sale of the property as ordinary income under section 1254.
(c)
Character of gain recognized by a shareholder upon a sale or exchange of S corporation stock
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if an S corporation shareholder recognizes gain upon a sale or exchange of stock in the S corporation (determined without regard to section 1254), the gain is treated as ordinary income under section 1254 to the extent of the shareholder's section 1254 costs (with respect to the shares sold or exchanged).
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Gain not attributable to section 1254 costs
—(A)
General rule.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to any portion of the gain recognized on the sale or exchange of the stock that the taxpayer establishes is not attributable to section 1254 costs. The portion of the gain recognized that is not attributable to section 1254 costs is that portion of the gain recognized that exceeds the amount of ordinary income that the shareholder would have recognized under section 1254 (with respect to the shares sold or exchanged) if, immediately prior to the sale or exchange of the stock, the corporation had sold at fair market value all of the corporation's property the disposition of which would result in the recognition by the shareholder of ordinary income under section 1254.
(B)
Substantiation.
To establish that a portion of the gain recognized is not attributable to a shareholder's section
1254 costs so as to qualify for the exception contained in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the shareholder must attach to the shareholder's tax return a statement detailing the shareholder's share of the fair market value and basis, and the shareholder's section 1254 costs, for each of the S corporation's natural resource recapture properties held immediately before the sale or exchange of stock.
(ii)
Transactions entered into as part of a plan to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254.
In the case of a contribution of property prior to a sale or exchange of stock pursuant to a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply. Instead, the amount recognized as ordinary income under section 1254 is the amount of ordinary income the selling or exchanging shareholder would have recognized under section 1254 (with respect to the shares sold or exchanged) had the S corporation sold its natural resource recapture property the disposition of which would have resulted in the recognition of ordinary income under section 1254. The amount recognized as ordinary income under the preceding sentence reduces the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the stock.
This reduced amount realized is used in determining any gain or loss on the sale or exchange.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Application of general rule upon a sale of S corporation stock.
C and D are equal shareholders in Y, an S corporation. As of January 1, 1997, Y holds two mining properties: Blackacre, with an adjusted basis of $5,000 and a fair market value of $35,000, and Whiteacre, with an adjusted basis of $20,000 and a fair market value of $15,000. Y also holds securities with a basis of $5,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. On January 1, 1997, D sells 50 percent of D's Y stock to E for $15,000. As of the date of the sale, D's adjusted basis in the Y stock sold is $7,500, and D has $18,000 of section 1254 costs with respect to Blackacre and $12,000 of section 1254 costs with respect to Whiteacre. Under this paragraph (c), the gain recognized by D upon the sale of Y stock is treated as ordinary income to the extent of D's section 1254 costs with respect to the stock sold, unless D establishes that a portion of such excess is not attributable to D's section 1254 costs. However, because D would recognize $7,500 in ordinary income under section 1254 with respect to the stock sold if Y sold Blackacre (the only asset the disposition of which would result in ordinary income to D under section 1254), the $7,500 of gain recognized by D upon the sale of D's Y stock is attributable to D's section 1254 costs. Therefore, upon the sale of stock to E, D recognizes $7,500 of ordinary income under this paragraph (c).

# Example 2. Sale of S corporation stock where gain is not entirely attributable to section 1254 costs.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Blackacre has a fair market value of $25,000, and the securities have a fair market value of $20,000. Immediately prior to the sale of stock to E, if Y had sold Blackacre (its only asset the disposition of which would result in the recognition of ordinary income to D under section 1254), D would recognize $5,000 in ordinary income with respect to the stock sold under section 1254. D attaches a statement to D's tax return for 1997 detailing D's share of the fair market values and bases, and D's section 1254 costs with respect to Blackacre and Whiteacre. Therefore, upon the sale of stock to E, of the $7,500 gain recognized by D, $5,000 is ordinary income under this paragraph (c).

# Example 3. Contribution of property prior to sale of S corporation stock as part of a plan to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254.
H owns all of the stock of Z, an S corporation. As of January 1, 1997, H has $3,000 of section 1254 costs with respect to property P, which is natural resource recapture property and Z's only asset. Property P has an adjusted basis of $5,000 and a fair market value of $8,000. H has a basis of $5,000 in Z stock, which has a fair market value of $8,000. On January 1, 1997, H contributes securities to Z which have a basis of $7,000 and a fair market value of $4,000. On April 15, 1997, H sells all of the Z stock to J for $12,000. On that date, H's adjusted basis in the Z stock is also $12,000. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the sale of stock is part of a plan (along with the contribution by H of the securities to Z) that has a principal purpose to avoid recognition of ordinary income under section 1254. Consequently, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, H must recognize $3,000 as ordinary income under section 1254, the amount of ordinary income that H would recognize as ordinary income under section 1254 if property P were sold at fair market value. In addition, H reduces the amount realized on the sale of the stock ($12,000) by $3,000. As a result, H also recognizes a $3,000 capital loss on the sale of the stock ($9,000 amount realized less $12,000 adjusted basis).
(d)
Section 1254 costs of a shareholder.
An S corporation shareholder's section 1254 costs with respect to any natural
resource recapture property held by the corporation include all of the shareholder's section 1254 costs with respect to the property in the hands of the S corporation. See § 1.1254-1(b)(1) for the definition of section 1254 costs.
(e)
Section 1254 costs of an acquiring shareholder after certain acquisitions
—(1)
Basis determined under section 1012.
If stock in an S corporation that holds natural resource recapture property is acquired and the acquiring shareholder's basis for the stock is determined solely by reference to its cost (within the meaning of section 1012), the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the corporation in the acquiring shareholder's hands is zero on the acquisition date.
(2)
Basis determined under section 1014(a).
If stock in an S corporation that holds natural resource recapture property is acquired from a decedent and the acquiring shareholder's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the stock on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the corporation in the acquiring shareholder's hands is zero on the acquisition date.
(3)
Basis determined under section 1014(b)(9).
If stock in an S corporation that holds natural resource recapture property is acquired before the death of the decedent, the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the corporation in the acquiring shareholder's hands includes the amount, if any, of the section 1254 costs deducted by the acquiring shareholder before the decedent's death, to the extent that the basis of the stock (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis when the property is acquired before the death of the decedent).
(4)
Gifts and section 1041 transfers.
If stock is acquired in a transfer that is a gift, in a transfer that is a part sale or exchange and part gift, in a transfer that is described in section 1041(a), or in a transfer at death where the basis of property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022, the amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the corporation in the acquiring shareholder's hands immediately after the transfer is an amount equal to—
(i) The amount of section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the corporation in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer; minus
(ii) The amount of any gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1254 by the transferor upon the transfer.
(f)
Special rules for a corporation that was formerly an S corporation or formerly a C corporation
—(1)
Section 1254 costs of an S corporation that was formerly a C corporation.
In the case of a C corporation that holds natural resource recapture property and that elects to be an S corporation, each shareholder's section 1254 costs as of the beginning of the corporation's first taxable year as an S corporation include a pro rata share of the section 1254 costs of the corporation as of the close of the last taxable year that the corporation was a C corporation.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section:

# Example 1. Sale of natural resource recapture property held by an S corporation that was formerly a C corporation.
(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation effective January 1, 1997. On that date, Y owns Oil Well, which is natural resource recapture property and a capital asset. Y has section 1254 costs of $20,000 as of the close of the last taxable year that it was a C corporation. On January 1, 1997, Oil Well has a value of $200,000 and a basis of $100,000. Thus, under section 1374, Y's net unrealized built-in gain is $100,000. Also on that date, Y's basis in Oil Well is allocated to A, Y's sole shareholder, under section 613A(c)(11) and the section 1254 costs are allocated to A under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, A has a basis in A's Y stock of $100,000.
(ii) On November 1, 1997, Y sells Oil Well for $250,000. During 1997, Y has taxable income greater than $100,000, and no other transactions or items treated as recognized built-in gain or loss. Under section 1374, Y has net recognized built-in gain of $100,000. Assuming a tax rate of 35 percent on capital gain, Y has a tax of $35,000 under section 1374. The tax of $35,000 is treated as a capital loss under section 1366(f)(2). A has a realized gain on the sale of $150,000 ($250,000 minus
$100,000) of which $20,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1254, and $130,000 is recognized as capital gain. Consequently, A recognizes ordinary income of $20,000 and net capital gain of $95,000 ($130,000 minus $35,000) on the sale.

# Example 2. Sale of stock followed by sale of natural resource recapture property held by an S corporation that was formerly a C corporation.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
(i). On November 1, 1997, A sells all of A's Y stock to P for $250,000. A has a realized gain on the sale of $150,000 ($250,000 minus $100,000) of which $20,000 is recognized as ordinary income under section 1254, and $130,000 is recognized as capital gain.
(ii) On November 2, 1997, Y sells Oil Well for $250,000. During 1997, Y has taxable income greater than $100,000, and no other transactions or items treated as recognized built-in gain or loss. Under section 1374, Y has net recognized built-in gain of $100,000. Assuming a tax rate of 35 percent on capital gain, Y has a tax of $35,000 under section 1374. The tax of $35,000 is treated as a capital loss under section 1366(f)(2). P has a realized gain on the sale of $150,000 ($250,000 minus $100,000), which is recognized as capital gain. Consequently, P recognizes net capital gain of $115,000 ($150,000 minus $35,000) on the sale.
(3)
Section 1254 costs of a C corporation that was formerly an S corporation.
In the case of an S corporation that becomes a C corporation, the C corporation's section 1254 costs with respect to any natural resource recapture property held by the corporation as of the beginning of the corporation's first taxable year as a C corporation include the sum of its shareholders' section 1254 costs with respect to the property as of the close of the last taxable year that the corporation was an S corporation. In the case of an S termination year as defined in section 1362(e)(4), the shareholders' section 1254 costs are determined as of the close of the S short year as defined in section 1362(e)(1)(A). See paragraph (g)(5) of this section for rules on determining the aggregate amount of the shareholders' section 1254 costs.
(g)
Determination of a shareholder's section 1254 costs upon certain stock transactions
—(1)
Issuance of stock.
Upon an issuance of stock (whether such stock is newly-issued or had been held as treasury stock) by an S corporation in a reorganization described in section 368 or otherwise—
(i) Each recipient of shares must be allocated a pro rata share (determined solely with respect to the shares issued in the transaction) of the aggregate of the S corporation shareholders' section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by the S corporation immediately before the issuance (as determined pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section); and
(ii) Each pre-existing shareholder must reduce his or her section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by the S corporation immediately before the issuance by an amount equal to the pre-existing shareholder's section 1254 costs immediately before the issuance multiplied by the percentage of stock of the corporation issued in the transaction.
(2)
Natural resource recapture property acquired in exchange for stock.
If natural resource recapture property is transferred to an S corporation in exchange for stock of the S corporation (for example, in a section 351 transaction, or in a reorganization described in section 368), the S corporation must allocate to its shareholders a pro rata share of the S corporation's section 1254 costs with respect to the property immediately after the transaction (as determined under § 1.1254-3(b)(1)).
(3)
Treatment of nonvested stock.
Stock issued in connection with the performance of services that is substantially nonvested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)) is treated as issued for purposes of this section at the first time it is treated as outstanding stock of the S corporation for purposes of section 1361.
(4)
Exception.
Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to stock issued in exchange for stock of the same S corporation (as for example, in a recapitalization described in section 368(a)(1)(E)).
(5)
Aggregate of S corporation shareholders' section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by the S corporation
—(i)
In general.
The aggregate of S corporation shareholders' section 1254 costs is equal to the sum of each shareholder's section 1254 costs. The S corporation must determine each shareholder's section 1254 costs under either paragraph (g)(5)(ii) (written data) or paragraph (g)(5)(iii) (assumptions) of this section. The S
corporation may determine the section 1254 costs of some shareholders under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section and of others under paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Written data.
An S corporation may determine a shareholder's section 1254 costs by using written data provided by a shareholder showing the shareholder's section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by the S corporation unless the S corporation knows or has reason to know that the written data is inaccurate. If an S corporation does not receive written data upon which it may rely, the S corporation must use the assumptions provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section in determining a shareholder's section 1254 costs.
(iii)
Assumptions.
An S corporation that does not use written data pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section to determine a shareholder's section 1254 costs must use the following assumptions to determine the shareholder's section 1254 costs—
(A) The shareholder deducted his or her share of the amount of deductions under sections 263(c), 616, and 617 in the first year in which the shareholder could claim a deduction for such amounts, unless in the case of expenditures under sections 263(c) or 616 the S corporation elected to capitalize such amounts;
(B) The shareholder was not subject to the following limitations with respect to the shareholder's depletion allowance under section 611, except to the extent a limitation applied at the corporate level: the taxable income limitation of section 613(a); the depletable quantity limitations of section 613A(c); or the limitations of sections 613A(d)(2), (3), and (4) (exclusion of retailers and refiners).
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1. Transfer of natural resource recapture property to an S corporation in a section 351 transaction.
As of January 1, 1997, A owns all the stock (20 shares) in X, an S corporation. X holds property that is not natural resource recapture property that has a fair market value of $2,000 and an adjusted basis of $2,000. On January 1, 1997, B transfers natural resource recapture property, Property P, to X in exchange for 80 shares of X stock in a transaction that qualifies under section 351. Property P has a fair market value of $8,000 and an adjusted basis of $5,000. Pursuant to section 351, B does not recognize gain on the transaction. Immediately prior to the transaction, B's section 1254 costs with respect to Property P equaled $6,000. Under § 1.1254-2(c)(1), B does not recognize any gain under section 1254 on the section 351 transaction and, under § 1.1254-3(b)(1), X's section 1254 costs with respect to Property P immediately after the contribution equal $6,000. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, each shareholder is allocated a pro rata share of X's section 1254 costs. The pro rata share of X's section 1254 costs that is allocated to A equals $1,200 (20 percent interest in X multiplied by X's $6,000 of section 1254 costs). The pro rata share of X's section 1254 costs that is allocated to B equals $4,800 (80 percent interest in X multiplied by X's $6,000 of section 1254 costs).

# Example 2. Contribution of money in exchange for stock of an S corporation holding natural resource recapture property.
As of January 1, 1997, A and B each own 50 percent of the stock (50 shares each) in X, an S corporation. X holds natural resource recapture property, Property P, which has a fair market value of $20,000 and an adjusted basis of $14,000. A's and B's section 1254 costs with respect to Property P are $4,000 and $1,500, respectively. On January 1, 1997, C contributes $20,000 to X in exchange for 100 shares of X's stock. Under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, X must allocate to C a pro rata share of its shareholders' section 1254 costs. Using the assumptions set forth in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section, X determines that A's section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by X equal $4,500. Using written data provided by B, X determines that B's section 1254 costs with respect to Property P equal $1,500. Thus, the aggregate of X's shareholders' section 1254 costs equals $6,000. C's pro rata share of the $6,000 of section 1254 costs equals $3,000 (C's 50 percent interest in X multiplied by $6,000). Under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, A's section 1254 costs are reduced by $2,000 (A's actual section 1254 costs ($4,000) multiplied by 50 percent). B's section 1254 costs are reduced by $750 (B's actual section 1254 costs ($1,500) multiplied by 50 percent).

# Example 3. Merger involving an S corporation that holds natural resource recapture property.
X, an S corporation with one shareholder, A, holds as its sole asset natural resource recapture property that has a fair market value of $120,000 and an adjusted basis of $40,000. A has section 1254 costs with respect to the property of $60,000. For valid business reasons, X merges into Y, an S corporation with one shareholder, B, in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A). Y holds property that is not natural resource recapture property that has a fair market value of
$120,000 and basis of $120,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, A does not recognize ordinary income under section 1254 upon the exchange of stock in the merger because A did not otherwise recognize gain on the merger. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, Y must allocate to A and B a pro rata share of its $60,000 of section 1254 costs. Thus, A and B are each allocated $30,000 of section 1254 costs (50 percent interest in X, each, multiplied by $60,000).
[T.D. 8684, 61 FR 53063, Oct. 10, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6242, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1254-5
Special rules for partnerships and their partners.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for applying the provisions of section 1254 to partnerships and their partners upon the disposition of natural resource recapture property by the partnership and certain distributions of property by a partnership. See section 751 and the regulations thereunder for rules concerning the treatment of gain upon the transfer of a partnership interest.
(b)
Determination of gain treated as ordinary income under section 1254 upon the disposition of natural resource recapture property by a partnership
—(1)
General rule.
Upon a disposition of natural resource recapture property by a partnership, the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1254 is determined at the partner level. Each partner must recognize as ordinary income under section 1254 the lesser of—
(i) The partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property disposed of; or
(ii) The partner's share of the amount, if any, by which the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, or the fair market value of the property upon any other disposition, exceeds the adjusted basis of the property.
(2)
Exception to partner level recapture in the case of abusive allocations.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply in determining the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1254 upon a disposition of section 1254 property by a partnership if the partnership has allocated the amount realized or gain recognized from the disposition with a principal purpose of avoiding the recognition of ordinary income under section 1254. In such case, the amount of gain on the disposition recaptured as ordinary income under section 1254 is determined at the partnership level.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are illustrated by the following examples which assume that capital accounts are maintained in accordance with section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder:

# Example 1.
Partner level recapture—In general. A, B, and C, have equal interests in capital in Partnership ABC that was formed on January 1, 1985. The partnership acquired an undeveloped domestic oil property on January 1, 1985, for $120,000. The partnership allocated the property's basis to each partner in proportion to the partner's interest in partnership capital, so each partner was allocated $40,000 of basis. In 1985, the partnership incurred $60,000 of productive well intangible drilling and development costs with respect to the property. The partnership elected to deduct the intangible drilling and development costs as expenses under section 263(c). Each partner deducted $20,000 of the intangible drilling and development costs. Assume that depletion allowable under section 613A(c)(7)(D) for each partner for 1985 was $10,000. On January 1, 1986, the partnership sold the oil property to an unrelated third party for $210,000. Each partner's allocable share of the amount realized is $70,000. Each partner's basis in the oil property at the end of 1985 is $30,000 ($40,000 cost—$10,000 depletion deductions claimed). Each partner has a gain of $40,000 on the sale of the oil property ($70,000 amount realized—$30,000 adjusted basis in the oil property). Assume that each partner's depletion allowance would not have been increased if the intangible drilling and development costs had been capitalized. Each partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property are $20,000. Thus, A, B, and C each must treat $20,000 of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1254(a).

# Example 2. Special allocation of intangible drilling and development costs.
K and L form a partnership on January 1, 1997, to acquire and develop a geothermal property as defined under section 613(e)(2). The partnership agreement provides that all intangible drilling and development costs will be allocated to partner K, and that all other items of income, gain, or loss will be allocated equally between the two partners. Assume these allocations have substantial economic effect under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. The partnership acquires a lease covering undeveloped acreage located in the United States for $50,000. In 1997, the partnership incurs $50,000 of intangible drilling and
development costs that are allocated to partner K. The partnership also has $30,000 of depletion deductions, which are allocated equally between K and L. On January 1, 1998, the partnership sells the geothermal property to an unrelated third party for $160,000 and recognizes a gain of $140,000 ($160,000 amount realized less $20,000 adjusted basis ($50,000 unadjusted basis less $30,000 depletion deductions)). This gain is allocated equally between K and L. Because K's section 1254 costs are $65,000 and L's section 1254 costs are $15,000, K recognizes $65,000 as ordinary income under section 1254(a) and L recognizes $15,000 as ordinary income under section 1254(a). The remaining $5,000 of gain allocated to K and $55,000 of gain allocated to L is characterized without regard to section 1254.

# Example 3. Section 59(e) election to capitalize intangible drilling and development costs.
Partnership DK has 50 equal partners. On January 1, 1995, the partnership purchases an undeveloped oil and gas property for $100,000. The partnership allocates the property's basis equally among the partners, so each partner is allocated $2,000 of basis. In January 1995, the partnership incurs $240,000 of intangible drilling and development costs with respect to the property. The partnership elects to deduct the intangible drilling and development costs as expenses under section 263(c). Each partner is allocated $4,800 of intangible drilling and development costs. One of the partners, H, elects under section 59(e) to capitalize his $4,800 share of intangible drilling and development costs. Therefore, H is permitted to amortize his $4,800 share of intangible drilling and development costs over 60 months. H takes a $960 amortization deduction in 1995. Each of the remaining 49 partners deducts his $4,800 share of intangible drilling and development costs in 1995. Assume that depletion allowable for each partner under section 613A(c)(7)(D) for 1995 is $1,000. On December 31, 1995, the partnership sells the property for $300,000. Each partner is allocated $6,000 of amount realized. Each partner that deducted the intangible drilling and development costs has a basis in the oil property at the end of 1995 of $1,000 ($2,000 cost − $1,000 depletion deductions claimed). Each of these partners has a gain of $5,000 on the sale of the oil property ($6,000 amount realized − $1,000 adjusted basis in the property). The section 1254 costs of each partner that deducted intangible drilling and development costs are $5,800 ($4,800 intangible drilling and development costs deducted + $1,000 depletion deductions claimed). Because each partner's section 1254 costs ($5,800) exceed each partner's share of amount realized less each partner's adjusted basis ($5,000), each partner must treat his $5,000 gain recognized on the sale of the oil property as ordinary income under section 1254(a). Because H elected under section 59(e) to capitalize the $4,800 of intangible drilling and development costs and amortized only $960 of the costs in 1995, the $3,840 of unamortized intangible drilling and development costs are included in H's basis in the oil property. Therefore, at the end of 1995 H's basis in the oil property is $4,840 (($2,000 cost + $4,800 capitalized intangible drilling and development costs) − ($960 intangible drilling and development costs amortized + $1,000 depletion deduction claimed)). H's gain on the sale of the oil property is $1,160 ($6,000 amount realized − $4,840 adjusted basis). H's section 1254 costs are $1,960 ($960 intangible drilling and development costs amortized + $1,000 depletion deductions claimed). Because H's section 1254 costs ($1,960) exceed H's share of amount realized less H's adjusted basis ($1,160), H must treat the $1,160 of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1254(a).
(c)
Section 1254 costs of a partner
—(1)
General rule.
A partner's section 1254 costs with respect to property held by a partnership include all of the partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property in the hands of the partnership. In the case of property contributed to a partnership in a transaction described in section 721, a partner's section 1254 costs include all of the partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property prior to contribution. Section 1.1254-1(b)(1)(iv), which provides rules concerning the treatment of suspended deductions, applies to amounts not deductible pursuant to section 704(d).
(2)
Section 1254 costs of a transferee partner after certain acquisitions
—(i)
Basis determined under section 1012.
If a person acquires an interest in a partnership that holds natural resource recapture property (transferee partner) and the transferee partner's basis for the interest is determined by reference to its cost (within the meaning of section 1012), the amount of the transferee partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property held by the partnership is zero on the acquisition date.
(ii)
Basis determined by reason of the application of section 1014(a).
If a transferee partner acquires an interest in a partnership that holds natural resource recapture property from a decedent and the transferee partner's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the partnership interest on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date
provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), the amount of the transferee partner's section 1254 costs with respect to property held by the partnership is zero on the acquisition date.
(iii)
Basis determined by reason of the application of section 1014(b)(9).
If an interest in a partnership that holds natural resource recapture property is acquired before the death of the decedent, the amount of the transferee partner's section 1254 costs with respect to property held by the partnership shall include the amount, if any, of the section 1254 costs deducted by the transferee partner before the decedent's death, to the extent that the basis of the partner's interest (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis when the property is acquired before the death of the decedent).
(iv)
Gifts and section 1041 transfers.
If an interest in a partnership is transferred in a transfer that is a gift, in a transfer that is a part sale or exchange and part gift, in a transfer that is described in section 1041(a), or in a transfer at death where the basis of property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022, the amount of the transferee partner's section 1254 costs with respect to property held by the partnership immediately after the transfer is an amount equal to—
(A) The amount of the transferor partner's section 1254 costs with respect to the property immediately before the transfer; minus
(B) The amount of any gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1254 by the transferor partner upon the transfer.
(d)
Property distributed to a partner
—(1)
In general.
The section 1254 costs for any natural resource recapture property received by a partner in a distribution with respect to part or all of an interest in a partnership include—
(i) The aggregate of the partners' section 1254 costs with respect to the natural resource recapture property immediately prior to the distribution; reduced by
(ii) The amount of any gain taken into account as ordinary income under section 751 by the partnership or the partners (as constituted after the distribution) on the distribution of the natural resource recapture property.
(2)
Aggregate of partners' section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by a partnership
—(i)
In general.
The aggregate of partners' section 1254 costs is equal to the sum of each partner's section 1254 costs. The partnership must determine each partner's section 1254 costs under either paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) (written data) or paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) (assumptions) of this section. The partnership may determine the section 1254 costs of some of the partners under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section and of others under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(A)
Written data.
A partnership may determine a partner's section 1254 costs by using written data provided by a partner showing the partner's section 1254 costs with respect to natural resource recapture property held by the partnership unless the partnership knows or has reason to know that the written data is inaccurate. If a partnership does not receive written data upon which it may rely, the partnership must use the assumptions provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section in determining a partner's section 1254 costs.
(B)
Assumptions.
A partnership that does not use written data pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section to determine a partner's section 1254 costs must use the following assumptions to determine the partner's section 1254 costs:
(
1
) The partner deducted his or her share of deductions under section 263(c), 616, or 617 for the first year in which the partner could claim a deduction for such amounts, unless in the case of expenditures under section 263(c) or 616, the partnership elected to capitalize such amounts;
(
2
) The partner was not subject to the following limitations with respect to the partner's depletion allowance under section 611, except to the extent a limitation applied at the partnership level: the taxable income limitation of section 613(a); the depletable quantity limitations of section 613A(c); or the limitations of section 613A(d)(2), (3),
and (4) (exclusion of retailers and refiners).

§ 1.1254-6
Effective/applicability date.
(a) Sections 1.1254-1 through 1.1254-3 and 1.1254-5 are effective with respect to any disposition of natural resource recapture property occurring after March 13, 1995. The rule in § 1.1254-1(b)(2)(iv)(A)(
2
), relating to a nonoperating mineral interest carved out of an operating mineral interest with respect to which an expenditure has been deducted, is effective with respect to any disposition occurring after March 13, 1995, of property (within the meaning of section 614) that is placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986. Section 1.1254-4 applies to dispositions of natural resource recapture property by an S corporation (and a corporation that was formerly an S corporation) and dispositions of S corporation stock occurring on or after October 10, 1996. Sections 1.1254-2(d)(1)(ii) and 1.1254-3(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(i), and (d)(1)(ii) are effective for dispositions of property occurring on or after October 10, 1996.
(b) The provisions of §§ 1.1254-2(a)(1), 1.1254-3(b)(2), 1.1254-4(e)(4), and 1.1254-5(c)(2)(iv) that relate to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.

§ 1.1256(e)-1
Identification of hedging transactions.
(a)
Identification and recordkeeping requirements.
Under section 1256(e)(2), a taxpayer that enters into a hedging transaction must identify the transaction as a hedging transaction before the close of the day on which the taxpayer enters into the transaction.
(b)
Requirements for identification.
The identification of a hedging transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2) must satisfy the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f)(1). Solely for purposes of section 1256(f)(1), however, an identification that does not satisfy all of the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f)(1) is nevertheless treated as an identification under section 1256(e)(2).
(c)
Consistency with § 1.1221-2.
Any identification for purposes of § 1.1221-2(f)(1) is also an identification for purposes of this section. If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of § 1.1221-2(g)(1)(ii), the transaction is treated as if it were not identified as a hedging transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2).
(d)
Effective date.
The rules of this section apply to transactions entered into on or after March 20, 2002.

§ 1.1256(e)-2
Special rules for syndicates.
(a)
Allocation of losses.
For purposes of section 1256(e)(3),
syndicate
means any partnership or other entity (other than a corporation that is not an S corporation) if more than 35 percent of the losses of such entity during the taxable year are allocated to limited partners or limited entrepreneurs (within the meaning of section 461(k)(4)).
(b)
Determination of loss amount.
For purposes of section 1256(e)(3), the amount of losses to be allocated under paragraph (a) of this section is calculated without regard to section 163(j).
(c)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules in this section:
(1)
Facts.
Entity is an S corporation that is equally owned by individuals A and B. A provides all of the goods and services provided by Entity. B provided all of the capital for Entity but does not participate in Entity's business. For the current taxable year, Entity has gross receipts of $5,000,000, non-interest expenses of $4,500,000, and interest expense of $600,000.
(2)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, Entity has a net loss of $100,000 ($5,000,000 minus $5,100,000) for the current taxable year. One half (50 percent) of this loss is allocated to B, a limited owner. Therefore, for the current taxable year, Entity is a syndicate within the meaning of section 1256(e)(3)(B).
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after March 22, 2021. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) (determined without regard to section 267(c)(3)) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules in this section for a
taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before March 22, 2021, provided that those taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply all of the rules of this section to that taxable year and each subsequent taxable year.
[T.D. 9943, 86 FR 5540, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.1258-1
Netting rule for certain conversion transactions.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to provide taxpayers with a method to net certain gains and losses from positions of the same conversion transaction before determining the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 1258(a).
(b)
Netting of gain and loss for identified transactions
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer disposes of or terminates all the positions of an identified netting transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within a 14-day period in a single taxable year, all gains and losses on those positions taken into account for Federal tax purposes within that period (other than built-in losses as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) are netted solely for purposes of determining the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 1258(a). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a taxpayer is treated as disposing of any position that is treated as sold under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder (for example, under section 1256(a)(1)).
(2)
Identified netting transaction.
For purposes of this section, an identified netting transaction is a conversion transaction (as defined in section 1258(c)) that the taxpayer identifies as an identified netting transaction on its books and records. Identification of each position of the conversion transaction must be made before the close of the day on which the position becomes part of the conversion transaction. No particular form of identification is necessary, but all the positions of a single conversion transaction must be identified as part of the same transaction and must be distinguished from all other positions.
(c)
Definition of built-in loss.
For purposes of this section, built-in loss means—
(1) Built-in loss as defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B); and
(2) If a taxpayer realizes gain or loss on any one position of a conversion transaction (for example, under section 1256), as of the date that gain or loss is realized, any unrecognized loss in any other position of the conversion transaction that is not disposed of, terminated, or treated as sold under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder within 14 days of and within the same taxable year as the realization event.
(d)
Examples.
These examples illustrate this section:

# Example 1.
Identified netting transaction with simultaneous actual dispositions. (i) On December 1, 1995, A purchases 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for $100,000 and enters into a forward contract to sell 1,000 shares of XYZ stock on November 30, 1997, for $110,000. The XYZ stock is actively traded as defined in § 1.1092(d)-1(a) and is a capital asset in A's hands. A maintains books and records on which, on December 1, 1995, it identifies the two positions as all the positions of a single conversion transaction. A owns no other XYZ stock. On December 1, 1996, when the applicable imputed income amount for the transaction is $7,000, A sells the 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for $95,000. On the same day, A terminates its forward contract with its counterparty, receiving $10,200. No dividends were received on the stock during the time it was part of the conversion transaction.
(ii) The XYZ stock and forward contract are positions of a conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially all of A's expected return from the overall transaction is attributable to the time value of the net investment in the transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1).
(iii) A disposed of or terminated all the positions of the conversion transaction within 14 days and within the same taxable year as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The transaction is an identified netting transaction because it meets the identification requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Solely for purposes of section 1258(a), the $5,000 loss realized ($100,000 basis less $95,000 amount realized) on the disposition of the XYZ stock is netted against the $10,200 gain recognized on the disposition of the forward contract. Thus, the net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of section 1258(a) is $5,200 ($10,200 gain less $5,000 loss). Only the $5,200 net gain is recharacterized as ordinary income under section 1258(a) even though the applicable imputed income amount is $7,000. For Federal tax purposes other than section 1258(a), A
has recognized a $10,200 gain on the disposition of the forward contract ($5,200 of which is treated as ordinary income) and realized a separate $5,000 loss on the sale of the XYZ stock.

# Example 2. Identified netting transaction with built-in loss.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A had purchased the XYZ stock for $104,000 on May 15, 1995. The XYZ stock had a fair market value of $100,000 on December 1, 1995, the date it became part of a conversion transaction.
(ii) The results are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A has built-in loss (in addition to the $5,000 loss that arose economically during the period of the conversion transaction), as defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B), of $4,000 on the XYZ stock. That $4,000 built-in loss is not netted against the $10,200 gain on the forward contract for purposes of section 1258(a). Thus, the net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of section 1258(a) is $5,200, the same as in
Example 1.
The $4,000 built-in loss is recognized and has a character determined without regard to section 1258.
(e)
Effective date and transition rule
—(1)
In general.
These regulations are effective for conversion transactions that are outstanding on or after December 21, 1995.
(2)
Transition rule for identification requirements.
In the case of a conversion transaction entered into before February 20, 1996, paragraph (b)(2) of this section is treated as satisfied if the identification is made before the close of business on February 20, 1996.

§ 1.1271-1
Special rules applicable to amounts received on retirement, sale, or exchange of debt instruments.
(a)
Intention to call before maturity
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 1271(a)(2), all or a portion of gain realized on a sale or exchange of a debt instrument to which section 1271 applies is treated as interest income if there was an intention to call the debt instrument before maturity. An intention to call a debt instrument before maturity means a written or oral agreement or understanding not provided for in the debt instrument between the issuer and the original holder of the debt instrument that the issuer will redeem the debt instrument before maturity. In the case of debt instruments that are part of an issue, the agreement or understanding must be between the issuer and the original holders of a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue. An intention to call before maturity can exist even if the intention is conditional (e.g., the issuer's decision to call depends on the financial condition of the issuer on the potential call date) or is not legally binding. For purposes of this section, original holder means the first holder (other than an underwriter or dealer that purchased the debt instrument for resale in the ordinary course of its trade or business).
(2)
Exceptions.
In addition to the exceptions provided in sections 1271(a)(2)(B) and 1271(b), section 1271(a)(2) does not apply to—
(i) A debt instrument that is publicly offered (as defined in § 1.1275-1(h));
(ii) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies (relating to certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration); or
(iii) A debt instrument sold pursuant to a private placement memorandum that is distributed to more than ten offerees and that is subject to the sanctions of section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77l) or the prohibitions of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j).
(b)
Short-term obligations
—(1)
In general.
Under sections 1271 (a)(3) and (a)(4), all or a portion of the gain realized on the sale or exchange of a short-term government or nongovernment obligation is treated as interest income. Sections 1271 (a)(3) and (a)(4), however, do not apply to any short-term obligation subject to section 1281. See § 1.1272-1(f) for rules to determine if an obligation is a short-term obligation.
(2)
Method of making elections.
Elections to accrue on a constant yield basis under sections 1271 (a)(3)(E) and (a)(4)(D) are made on an obligation-by-obligation basis by reporting the transaction on the basis of daily compounding on the taxpayer's timely filed Federal income tax return for the year of the sale or exchange. These elections are irrevocable.
(3)
Counting conventions.
In computing the ratable share of acquisition discount under section 1271(a)(3) or OID under section 1271(a)(4), any reasonable counting convention may be used (e.g., 30 days per month/360 days per year).
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4809, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1272-1
Current inclusion of OID in income.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
Under section 1272(a)(1), a holder of a debt instrument includes accrued OID in gross income (as interest), regardless of the holder's regular method of accounting. A holder includes qualified stated interest (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)) in income under the holder's regular method of accounting. See §§ 1.446-2 and 1.451-1.
(2)
Debt instruments not subject to OID inclusion rules.
Sections 1272(a)(2) and 1272(c) list exceptions to the general inclusion rule of section 1272(a)(1). For purposes of section 1272(a)(2)(E) (relating to certain loans between natural persons), a loan does not include a stripped bond or stripped coupon within the meaning of section 1286(e), and the rule in section 1272(a)(2)(E)(iii), which treats a husband and wife as 1 person, does not apply to loans made between a husband and wife.
(b)
Accrual of OID
—(1)
Constant yield method.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the amount of OID includible in the income of a holder of a debt instrument for any taxable year is determined using the constant yield method as described under this paragraph (b)(1).
(i)
Step one: Determine the debt instrument's yield to maturity.
The yield to maturity or yield of a debt instrument is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the debt instrument, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the debt instrument. The yield must be constant over the term of the debt instrument and, when expressed as a percentage, must be calculated to at least two decimal places. See paragraph (c) of this section for rules relating to the yield of certain debt instruments subject to contingencies.
(ii)
Step two: Determine the accrual periods.
An accrual period is an interval of time over which the accrual of OID is measured. Accrual periods may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt instrument, provided that each accrual period is no longer than 1 year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the final day of an accrual period or on the first day of an accrual period. In general, the computation of OID is simplest if accrual periods correspond to the intervals between payment dates provided by the terms of the debt instrument. In computing the length of accrual periods, any reasonable counting convention may be used (e.g., 30 days per month/360 days per year).
(iii)
Step three: Determine the OID allocable to each accrual period.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the OID allocable to an accrual
period equals the product of the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-1(b)) at the beginning of the accrual period and the yield of the debt instrument, less the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. In performing this calculation, the yield must be stated appropriately taking into account the length of the particular accrual period.
Example 1
in paragraph (j) of this section provides a formula for converting a yield based upon an accrual period of one length to an equivalent yield based upon an accrual period of a different length.
(iv)
Step four: Determine the daily portions of OID.
The daily portions of OID are determined by allocating to each day in an accrual period the ratable portion of the OID allocable to the accrual period. The holder of the debt instrument includes in income the daily portions of OID for each day during the taxable year on which the holder held the debt instrument.
(2)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to—
(i) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies (certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration);
(ii) A debt instrument that provides for contingent payments, other than a debt instrument described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section or except as provided in § 1.1275-4; or
(iii) A variable rate debt instrument to which § 1.1275-5 applies, except as provided in § 1.1275-5.
(3)
Modifications.
The amount of OID includible in income by a holder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is adjusted if—
(i) The holder purchased the debt instrument at a premium or an acquisition premium (within the meaning of § 1.1272-2); or
(ii) The holder made an election for the debt instrument under § 1.1272-3 to treat all interest as OID.
(4)
Special rules for determining the OID allocable to an accrual period.
The following rules apply to determine the OID allocable to an accrual period under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(i)
Unpaid qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period.
In determining the OID allocable to an accrual period, if an interval between payments of qualified stated interest contains more than 1 accrual period—
(A) The amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval (including any qualified stated interest that is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately following the interval) is allocated on a pro rata basis to each accrual period in the interval; and
(B) The adjusted issue price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval must be increased by the amount of any qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the first day of the accrual period but that is not payable until the end of the interval. See
Example 2
of paragraph (j) of this section for an example illustrating the rules in this paragraph (b)(4)(i).
(ii)
Final accrual period.
The OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period.
(iii)
Initial short accrual period.
If all accrual periods are of equal length, except for either an initial shorter accrual period or an initial and a final shorter accrual period, the amount of OID allocable to the initial accrual period may be computed using any reasonable method. See
Example 3
in paragraph (j) of this section.
(iv)
Payment on first day of an accrual period.
The adjusted issue price at the beginning of an accrual period is reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) that is made on the first day of the accrual period.
(c)
Yield and maturity of certain debt instruments subject to contingencies
—(1)
Applicability.
This paragraph (c) provides rules to determine the yield and maturity of certain debt instruments that provide for an alternative payment schedule (or schedules) applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency (or contingencies). This paragraph (c) applies, however, only if the timing and amounts of the payments that comprise each payment schedule are
known as of the issue date and the debt instrument is subject to paragraph (c)(2), (3), or (5) of this section. A debt instrument does not provide for an alternative payment schedule merely because there is a possibility of impairment of a payment (or payments) by insolvency, default, or similar circumstances. See § 1.1275-4 for the treatment of a debt instrument that provides for a contingency that is not described in this paragraph (c). See § 1.1273-1(c) to determine whether stated interest on a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (c) is qualified stated interest.
(2)
Payment schedule that is significantly more likely than not to occur.
If, based on all the facts and circumstances as of the issue date, a single payment schedule for a debt instrument, including the stated payment schedule, is significantly more likely than not to occur, the yield and maturity of the debt instrument are computed based on this payment schedule.
(3)
Mandatory sinking fund provision.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a debt instrument is subject to a mandatory sinking fund provision, the provision is ignored for purposes of computing the yield and maturity of the debt instrument if the use and terms of the provision meet reasonable commercial standards. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a mandatory sinking fund provision is a provision that meets the following requirements:
(i) The provision requires the issuer to redeem a certain amount of debt instruments in an issue prior to maturity.
(ii) The debt instruments actually redeemed are chosen by lot or purchased by the issuer either in the open market or pursuant to an offer made to all holders (with any proration determined by lot).
(iii) On the issue date, the specific debt instruments that will be redeemed on any date prior to maturity cannot be identified.
(4)
Consistency rule.
[Reserved]
(5)
Treatment of certain options.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) determine the yield and maturity of a debt instrument that provides the holder or issuer with an unconditional option or options, exercisable on one or more dates during the term of the debt instrument, that, if exercised, require payments to be made on the debt instrument under an alternative payment schedule or schedules (e.g., an option to extend or an option to call a debt instrument at a fixed premium). Under this paragraph (c)(5), an issuer is deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that minimizes the yield on the debt instrument, and a holder is deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that maximizes the yield on the debt instrument. If both the issuer and the holder have options, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) are applied to the options in the order that they may be exercised. See paragraph (j)
Example 5
through
Example 8
of this section.
(6)
Subsequent adjustments.
If a contingency described in this paragraph (c) (including the exercise of an option described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section) actually occurs or does not occur, contrary to the assumption made pursuant to this paragraph (c) (a change in circumstances), then, solely for purposes of sections 1272 and 1273, the debt instrument is treated as retired and then reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price on that date. See paragraph (j)
Example 5
and
Example 7
of this section. If, however, the change in circumstances results in a substantially contemporaneous pro-rata prepayment as defined in § 1.1275-2(f)(2), the pro-rata prepayment is treated as a payment in retirement of a portion of the debt instrument, which may result in gain or loss to the holder. See paragraph (j)
Example 6
and
Example 8
of this section.
(7)
Effective date.
This paragraph (c) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(d)
Certain debt instruments that provide for a fixed yield.
If a debt instrument provides for one or more contingent payments but all possible payment schedules under the terms of the instrument result in the same fixed yield, the yield of the debt instrument is the fixed yield. For example, the
yield of a debt instrument with principal payments that are fixed in total amount but that are uncertain as to time (such as a demand loan) is the stated interest rate if the issue price of the instrument is equal to the stated principal amount and interest is paid or compounded at a fixed rate over the entire term of the instrument. This paragraph (d) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(e)
Convertible debt instruments.
For purposes of section 1272, an option is ignored if it is an option to convert a debt instrument into the stock of the issuer, into the stock or debt of a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), or into cash or other property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such stock or debt. For debt instruments issued on or after February 5, 2013, the term
stock
in the preceding sentence means an equity interest in any entity that is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as either a partnership or a corporation.
(f)
Special rules to determine whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation
—(1)
Counting of either the issue date or maturity date.
For purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation (i.e., a debt instrument with a fixed maturity date that is not more than 1 year from the date of issue), the term of the debt instrument includes either the issue date or the maturity date, but not both dates.
(2)
Coordination with paragraph (c) of this section for certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, solely for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation under sections 871(g)(1)(B)(i), 881, 1271(a)(3), 1271(a)(4), 1272(a)(2)(C), and 1283(a)(1), the maturity date of a debt instrument is the last possible date that the instrument could be outstanding under the terms of the instrument. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the last possible date that the debt instrument could be outstanding is determined without regard to § 1.1275-2(h) (relating to payments subject to remote or incidental contingencies).
(g)
Basis adjustment.
The basis of a debt instrument in the hands of the holder is increased by the amount of OID included in the holder's gross income and decreased by the amount of any payment from the issuer to the holder under the debt instrument other than a payment of qualified stated interest. See, however, § 1.1275-2(f) for rules regarding basis adjustments on a pro rata prepayment.
(h)
Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.
Section 1272 and this section apply to a debt instrument that provides for all payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, the functional currency of the taxpayer or qualified business unit of the taxpayer (even if that currency is other than the U.S. dollar). See § 1.988-2(b) to determine interest income or expense for debt instruments that provide for payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Each example assumes that all taxpayers use the calendar year as the taxable year. In addition, each example assumes a 30-day month, 360-day year, and that the initial accrual period begins on the issue date and the final accrual period ends on the day before the stated maturity date. Although, for purposes of simplicity, the yield as stated is rounded to two decimal places, the computations do not reflect any such rounding convention.

# Example 1. Accrual of OID on zero coupon debt instrument; choice of accrual periods.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1994, A purchases at original issue, for $675,564.17, a debt instrument that matures on July 1, 1999, and provides for a single payment of $1,000,000 at maturity.
(ii)
Determination of yield.
Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield of the debt instrument is 8 percent, compounded semiannually.
(iii)
Determination of accrual period.
Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, accrual periods may be of any length, provided that each accrual period is no longer than 1 year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or final day of an accrual period. The yield to maturity to be used in computing OID accruals in any accrual period, however, must reflect the length of the accrual period chosen. A yield based on compounding b times per year
is equivalent to a yield based on compounding c times per year as indicated by the following formula:
r = c{(1 + i/b)
b/c
−1}
In which:
i = The yield based on compounding b times per year expressed as a decimal
r = The equivalent yield based on compounding c times per year expressed as a decimal
b = The number of compounding periods in a year on which i is based (for example, 12, if i is based on monthly compounding)
c = The number of compounding periods in a year on which r is based
(iv)
Determination of OID allocable to each accrual period.
Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period is $27,022.56: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (8 percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first semiannual accrual period is $150.13 ($27,022.56/180).
(v)
Determination of OID if monthly accrual periods are used.
Alternatively, assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using monthly accrual periods. Using the above formula, the yield on the debt instrument reflecting monthly compounding is 7.87 percent, compounded monthly (12{(1 + .08/2)
2/12
−1}). Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is $4,430.48: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.87 percent/12), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first monthly accrual period is $147.68 ($4,430.48/30).

# Example 2. Accrual of OID on debt instrument with qualified stated interest.
(i)
Facts.
On September 1, 1994, A purchases at original issue, for $90,000, B corporation's debt instrument that matures on September 1, 2004, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $3,000, payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 1995.
(ii)
Determination of yield.
The debt instrument is a 10-year debt instrument with an issue price of $90,000 and a stated redemption price at maturity of $100,000. The semiannual payments of $3,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield is 7.44 percent, compounded semiannually.
(iii)
Accrual of OID if semiannual accrual periods are used.
Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period equals the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.44 percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($3,000). Therefore, the amount of OID for the first semiannual accrual period is $345.78 ($3,345.78-$3,000).
(iv)
Adjustment for accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest if monthly accrual periods are used.
Assume, alternatively, that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using monthly accrual periods. The yield, compounded monthly, is 7.32 percent. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.32 percent/12), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the qualified stated interest allocable to the first monthly accrual period is the pro rata amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the interval between payment dates ($3,000 ×
1/6
, or $500). Therefore, the amount of OID for the first monthly accrual period is $49.18 ($549.18-$500). Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for purposes of determining the amount of OID for the second monthly accrual period is $90,549.18 ($90,000 + $49.18 + $500). Although the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for this purpose includes the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the first monthly accrual period, A includes the qualified stated interest in income based on A's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method).

# Example 3. Accrual of OID for debt instrument with initial short accrual period.
(i)
Facts.
On May 1, 1994, G purchases at original issue, for $80,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on July 1, 2004. The debt instrument provides for a single payment at maturity of $250,000. G computes its OID using 6-month accrual periods ending on January 1 and July 1 of each year and an initial short 2-month accrual period from May 1, 1994, through June 30, 1994.
(ii)
Determination of yield.
The yield on the debt instrument is 11.53 percent, compounded semiannually.
(iii)
Determination of OID allocable to initial short accrual period.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, G may use any reasonable method to compute OID for the initial short accrual period. One reasonable method is to calculate the amount of OID pursuant to the following formula:
OID
short
= IP × (i/k) × f
In which:
OID
short
= The amount of OID allocable to the initial short accrual period
IP = The issue price of the debt instrument
i = The yield to maturity expressed as a decimal
k = The number of accrual periods in a year
f = A fraction whose numerator is the number of days in the initial short accrual period, and whose denominator is the number of days in a full accrual period
(iv)
Amount of OID for the initial short accrual period.
Under this method, the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period is $1,537 ($80,000 × (11.53 percent/2) × (60/180)).
(v)
Alternative method.
Another reasonable method is to calculate the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period using the yield based on bi-monthly compounding, computed pursuant to the formula set forth in
Example 1
of paragraph (j) of this section. Under this method, the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period is $1,508.38 ($80,000 × (11.31 percent/6)).

# Example 4. Impermissible accrual of OID using a method other than constant yield method.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1994, B purchases at original issue, for $100,000, C corporation's debt instrument that matures on July 1, 1999, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for a single payment at maturity of $148,024.43. The yield of the debt instrument is 8 percent, compounded semiannually.
(ii)
Determination of yield.
Assume that C uses 6 monthly accrual periods to compute its OID for 1994. The yield must reflect monthly compounding (as determined using the formula described in
Example 1
of paragraph (j) of this section). As a result, the monthly yield of the debt instrument is 7.87 percent, divided by 12. C may not compute its monthly yield for the last 6 months in 1994 by dividing 8 percent by 12.

# Example 5. Debt instrument subject to put option.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, G purchases at original issue, for $70,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2010, with a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995. The debt instrument gives G an unconditional right to put the bond back to H, exercisable on January 1, 2005, in return for $85,000 (exclusive of the $4,000 of stated interest payable on that date).
(ii)
Determination of yield and maturity.
Yield determined without regard to the put option is 12.47 percent, compounded semiannually. Yield determined by assuming that the put option is exercised (i.e., by using January 1, 2005, as the maturity date and $85,000 as the stated principal amount payable on that date) is 12.56 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that G will exercise the put option, because exercise of the option would increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 10-year debt instrument with an issue price of $70,000, a stated redemption price at maturity of $85,000, and a yield of 12.56 percent, compounded semiannually.
(iii)
Consequences if put option is, in fact, not exercised.
If the put option is, in fact, not exercised, then, under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated, solely for purposes of sections 1272 and 1273, as if it were reissued on January 1, 2005, for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price on that date, $85,000. The new debt instrument matures on January 1, 2010, with a stated principal amount of $100,000 payable on that date and provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000. The yield of the new debt instrument is 12.08 percent, compounded semiannually.

# Example 6. Debt instrument subject to partial call option.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original issue, for $95,000, J corporation's debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2000, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995. On January 1, 1998, J has an unconditional right to call 50 percent of the principal amount of the debt instrument for $55,000 (exclusive of the $4,000 of stated interest payable on that date). If the call is exercised, the semiannual payments of interest made after the call date will be reduced to $2,000.
(ii)
Determination of yield and maturity.
Yield determined without regard to the call option is 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. Yield determined by assuming J exercises its call option is 10.75 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that J will not exercise the call option because exercise of the option would increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of $100,000, and a yield of 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually.
(iii)
Consequences if the call option is, in fact, exercised.
If the call option is, in fact, exercised, then under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated as if the issuer made a pro rata prepayment of $55,000 that is subject to § 1.1275-2(f). Consequently, under § 1.1275-2(f)(1), the instrument is treated as consisting of two debt instruments, one that is retired on the call date and one that remains outstanding after the call date. The
adjusted issue price, adjusted basis in the hands of the holder, and accrued OID of the original debt instrument is allocated between the two instruments based on the portion of the original instrument treated as retired. Since each payment remaining to be made after the call date is reduced by one-half, one-half of the adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and accrued OID is allocated to the debt instrument that is treated as retired. The adjusted issue price of the original debt instrument immediately prior to the call date is $97,725.12, which equals the issue price of the original debt instrument ($95,000) increased by the OID previously includible in gross income ($2,725.12). One-half of this adjusted issue price is allocated to the debt instrument treated as retired, and the other half is allocated to the debt instrument that is treated as remaining outstanding. Thus, the debt instrument treated as remaining outstanding has an adjusted issue price immediately after the call date of $97,725.12/2, or $48,862.56. The yield of this debt instrument continues to be 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. In addition, the portion of H's adjusted basis allocated to the debt instrument treated as retired is $97,725.12/2 or $48,862.56. Accordingly, under section 1271, H realizes a gain on the deemed retirement equal to $6,137.44 ($55,000 − $48,862.56).

# Example 7. Debt instrument issued at par that provides for payment of interest in kind.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, X corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of $6,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument gives X the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of $6,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual payments of interest of $360 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1997.
(ii)
Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt instrument.
Under § 1.1275-2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument is the same as the original debt instrument.
(iii)
Determination of yield and maturity.
The right to issue the PIK instrument is treated as an option to defer the initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined without regard to the option is 6 percent, compounded annually, Yield determined by assuming X exercises the option is 6 percent, compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that X will not exercise the option by issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would not decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of $100,000 and ten semiannual interest payments of $6,000, beginning on January 1, 1996. As a result, the debt instrument's yield is 6 percent, compounded annually.
(iv)
Determination of OID.
Under the payment schedule that would result if the option was exercised, none of the interest on the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest. Accordingly, under § 1.1273-1(c)(2), no payments on the debt instrument are qualified stated interest payments. Thus, $6,000 of OID accrues during the first annual accrual period. If the PIK instrument is not issued, $6,000 of OID accrues during each annual accrual period.
(v)
Consequences if the PIK instrument is issued.
Under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if X issues the PIK instrument on January 1, 1996, the issuance of the PIK instrument is not a payment on the debt instrument. Solely for purposes of sections 1272 and 1273, the debt instrument is deemed reissued on January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $106,000. The recomputed yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. The OID for the first annual accrual period after the deemed reissuance is $6,360. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument at the beginning of the next annual accrual period is $106,000 ($106,000 + $6,360 − $6,360). The OID for each of the four remaining annual accrual periods is $6,360.

# Example 8. Debt instrument issued at a discount that provides for payment of interest in kind.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, T purchases at original issue, for $75,500, U corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of $4,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument gives U the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of $4,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual payments of interest of $160 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1997.
(ii)
Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt instrument.
Under § 1.1275-2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument is the same as the original debt instrument.
(iii)
Determination of yield and maturity.
The right to issue the PIK instrument is treated
as an option to defer the initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined without regard to the option is 10.55 percent, compounded annually. Yield determined by assuming U exercises the option is 10.32 percent, compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that U will exercise the option by issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of $104,000 and four annual interest payments of $4,160, beginning on January 1, 1997. As a result, the yield is 10.32 percent, compounded annually.
(iv)
Consequences if the PIK instrument is not issued.
Assume that T chooses to compute OID accruals on the basis of an annual accrual period. On January 1, 1996, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument, and T's adjusted basis in the instrument, is $83,295.15. Under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if U actually makes the $4,000 interest payment on January 1, 1996, the debt instrument is treated as if U made a pro rata prepayment (within the meaning of § 1.1275-2(f)(2)) of $4,000, which reduces the amount of each payment remaining on the instrument by a factor of 4/104, or 1/26. Thus, under § 1.1275-2(f)(1) and section 1271, T realizes a gain of $796.34 ($4,000 −($83,295.15/26)). The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and T's adjusted basis immediately after the payment is $80,091.49 ($83,295.15 × 25/26) and the yield continues to be 10.32 percent, compounded annually.

# Example 9. Debt instrument with stepped interest rate.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1994, G purchases at original issue, for $85,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on July 1, 2004. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on the maturity date and provides for semiannual interest payments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1995. The amount of each payment is $2,000 for the first 5 years and $5,000 for the final 5 years.
(ii)
Determination of OID.
Assume that G computes its OID using 6-month accrual periods ending on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The yield of the debt instrument, determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, is 8.65 percent, compounded semiannually. Interest is unconditionally payable at a fixed rate of at least 4 percent, compounded semiannually, for the entire term of the debt instrument. Consequently, under § 1.1273-1(c)(1), the semiannual payments are qualified stated interest payments to the extent of $2,000. The amount of OID for the first 6-month accrual period is $1,674.34 (the issue price of the debt instrument ($85,000) times the yield of the debt instrument for that accrual period (.0865/2) less the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to that accrual period ($2,000)).

# Example 10. Debt instrument payable on demand that provides for interest at a constant rate.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, V purchases at original issue, for $100,000, W corporation's debt instrument. The debt instrument calls for interest to accrue at a rate of 9 percent, compounded annually. The debt instrument is redeemable at any time at the option of V for an amount equal to $100,000, plus accrued interest. V uses annual accrual periods to accrue OID on the debt instrument.
(ii)
Amount of OID.
Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the yield of the debt instrument is 9 percent, compounded annually. If the debt instrument is not redeemed during 1995, the amount of OID allocable to the year is $9,000.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4810, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30140, June 14, 1996; T.D. 9612, 78 FR 8015, Feb. 5, 2013]
§ 1.1272-2
Treatment of debt instruments purchased at a premium.
(a)
In general.
Under section 1272(c)(1), if a holder purchases a debt instrument at a premium, the holder does not include any OID in gross income. Under section 1272(a)(7), if a holder purchases a debt instrument at an acquisition premium, the holder reduces the amount of OID includible in gross income by the fraction determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(b)
Definitions and special rules
—(1)
Purchase.
For purposes of section 1272 and this section, purchase means any acquisition of a debt instrument, including the acquisition of a newly issued debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange or the acquisition of a debt instrument from a donor.
(2)
Premium.
A debt instrument is purchased at a premium if its adjusted basis, immediately after its purchase by the holder (including a purchase at original issue), exceeds the sum of all amounts payable on the instrument after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)).
(3)
Acquisition premium.
A debt instrument is purchased at an acquisition premium if its adjusted basis, immediately after its purchase (including a purchase at original issue), is—
(i) Less than or equal to the sum of all amounts payable on the instrument
after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)); and
(ii) Greater than the instrument's adjusted issue price (as defined in § 1.1275-1(b)).
(4)
Acquisition premium fraction.
In applying section 1272(a)(7), the cost of a debt instrument is its adjusted basis immediately after its acquisition by the purchaser. Thus, the numerator of the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7)(B) is the excess of the adjusted basis of the debt instrument immediately after its acquisition by the purchaser over the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument. The denominator of the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7)(B) is the excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the debt instrument after the purchase date, other than payments of qualified stated interest, over the instrument's adjusted issue price.
(5)
Election to accrue discount on a constant yield basis.
Rather than applying the acquisition premium fraction, a holder of a debt instrument purchased at an acquisition premium may elect under § 1.1272-3 to compute OID accruals by treating the purchase as a purchase at original issuance and applying the mechanics of the constant yield method.
(6)
Special rules for determining basis
—(i)
Debt instruments acquired in exchange for other property.
For purposes of section 1272(a)(7), section 1272(c)(1), and this section, if a debt instrument is acquired in an exchange for other property (other than in a reorganization defined in section 368) and the basis of the debt instrument is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the other property, the basis of the debt instrument may not exceed its fair market value immediately after the exchange. For example, if a debt instrument is distributed by a partnership to a partner in a liquidating distribution and the partner's basis in the debt instrument would otherwise be determined under section 732, the partner's basis in the debt instrument may not exceed its fair market value for purposes of this section.
(ii)
Acquisition by gift.
For purposes of this section, a donee's adjusted basis in a debt instrument is the donee's basis for determining gain under section 1015(a).
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

# Example 1. Debt instrument purchased at an acquisition premium.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1994, A purchased at original issue, for $500, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. The debt instrument matures on July 1, 1999, and calls for a single payment at maturity of $1,000. Under section 1273(a), the debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and, thus, OID of $500. On July 1, 1996, when the debt instrument's adjusted issue price is $659.75, A sells the debt instrument to B for $750 in cash.
(ii)
Acquisition premium fraction.
Because the cost to B of the debt instrument is less than the amount payable on the debt instrument after the purchase date, but is greater than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, B has paid an acquisition premium for the debt instrument. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID for any day that B holds the debt instrument is reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is $90.25 (the excess of the cost of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price) and the denominator of which is $340.25 (the excess of the sum of all payments after the purchase date over its adjusted issue price).

# Example 2. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at a premium.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original issue, for $1,000, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. On July 1, 1997, when H's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,000, Corporation X issues a new debt instrument with a stated redemption price at maturity of $750 to H in exchange for the old debt instrument. Assume that the issue price of the new debt instrument is $600. Thus, under section 1273(a), the debt instrument has OID of $150. The exchange qualifies as a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E), with the consequence that, under sections 354 and 358, H recognizes no loss on the exchange and has an adjusted basis in the new debt instrument of $1,000.
(ii)
Application of section 1272(c)(1).
Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at a premium of $250. Accordingly, under section 1272(c)(1), H is not required to include OID in income with respect to the new debt instrument.

# Example 3. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at an acquisition premium.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
of paragraph (c) of this section, except that H purchases the old debt instrument from another holder on July 1, 1995, and on July 1, 1997, H's adjusted basis in the old debt instrument is $700. Under section 1273(a), the
new debt instrument is issued with OID of $150.
(ii)
Application of section 1272(a)(7).
Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at an acquisition premium of $100. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in H's income is reduced by the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7).

# Example 4. Treatment of acquisition premium for debt instrument acquired by gift.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1994, D receives as a gift a debt instrument with a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and an adjusted issue price of $800. On that date, the fair market value of the debt instrument is $900 and the donor's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $950.
(ii)
Application of section 1272(a)(7).
Under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(6)(ii) of this section, D is considered to have purchased the debt instrument at an acquisition premium of $150. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in D's income is reduced by the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7).
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4814, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1272-3
Election by a holder to treat all interest on a debt instrument as OID.
(a)
Election.
A holder of a debt instrument may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on the instrument by using the constant yield method described in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this election, interest includes stated interest, acquisition discount, OID, de minimis OID, market discount, de minimis market discount, and unstated interest, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium.
(b)
Scope of election
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a holder may make the election for any debt instrument.
(2)
Exceptions, limitations, and special rules
—(i)
Debt instrument with amortizable bond premium (as determined under section 171).
(A) A holder may make the election for a debt instrument with amortizable bond premium only if the instrument qualifies as a bond under section 171(d).
(B) If a holder makes the election under this section for a debt instrument with amortizable bond premium, the holder is deemed to have made the election under section 171(c)(2) for the taxable year in which the instrument was acquired. If the holder has previously made the election under section 171(c)(2), the requirements of that election with respect to any debt instrument are satisfied by electing to amortize the bond premium under the rules provided by this section.
(ii)
Debt instrument with market discount.
(A) A holder may make the election under this section for a debt instrument with market discount only if the holder is eligible to make an election under section 1278(b).
(B) If a holder makes the election under this section for a debt instrument with market discount, the holder is deemed to have made both the election under section 1276(b)(2) for that instrument and the election under section 1278(b) for the taxable year in which the instrument was acquired. If the holder has previously made the election under section 1278(b), the requirements of that election with respect to any debt instrument are satisfied by electing to include the market discount in income in accordance with the rules provided by this section.
(iii)
Tax-exempt debt instrument.
A holder may not make the election for a tax-exempt obligation as defined in section 1275(a)(3).
(c)
Mechanics of the constant yield method
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the amount of interest that accrues during an accrual period is determined under rules similar to those under section 1272 (the constant yield method). In applying the constant yield method, however, a debt instrument subject to the election is treated as if—
(i) The instrument is issued for the holder's adjusted basis immediately after its acquisition by the holder;
(ii) The instrument is issued on the holder's acquisition date; and
(iii) None of the interest payments provided for in the instrument are qualified stated interest payments.
(2)
Special rules to determine adjusted basis.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section—
(i) If the debt instrument is acquired in an exchange for other property (other than in a reorganization defined in section 368) and the basis of the debt instrument is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the other property, the adjusted basis of the debt instrument may not exceed its
fair market value immediately after the exchange; and
(ii) If the debt instrument was acquired with amortizable bond premium (as determined under section 171), the adjusted basis of the debt instrument is reduced by an amount equal to the value attributable to any conversion feature.
(d)
Time and manner of making the election.
The election must be made for the taxable year in which the holder acquires the debt instrument. A holder makes the election by attaching to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return a statement that the holder is making an election under this section and that identifies the debt instruments subject to the election. A holder may make the election for a class or group of debt instruments by attaching a statement describing the type or types of debt instruments being designated for the election.
(e)
Revocation of election.
The election may not be revoked unless approved by the Commissioner.
(f)
Effective date.
This section applies to debt instruments acquired on or after April 4, 1994.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4815, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1273-1
Definition of OID.
(a)
In general.
Section 1273(a)(1) defines OID as the excess of a debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price. Section 1.1273-2 defines issue price, and paragraph (b) of this section defines stated redemption price at maturity. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for de minimis amounts of OID. Although the total amount of OID for a debt instrument may be indeterminate, § 1.1272-1(d) provides a rule to determine OID accruals on certain debt instruments that provide for a fixed yield. See
Example 10
in § 1.1272-1(j).
(b)
Stated redemption price at maturity.
A debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all payments provided by the debt instrument other than qualified stated interest payments. If the payment schedule of a debt instrument is determined under § 1.1272-1(c) (relating to certain debt instruments subject to contingencies), that payment schedule is used to determine the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.
(c)
Qualified stated interest
—(1)
Definition
—(i)
In general.
Qualified stated interest is stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that will be constructively received under section 451, at least annually at a single fixed rate (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Unconditionally payable.
Interest is unconditionally payable only if reasonable legal remedies exist to compel timely payment or the debt instrument otherwise provides terms and conditions that make the likelihood of late payment (other than a late payment that occurs within a reasonable grace period) or nonpayment a remote contingency (within the meaning of § 1.1275-2(h)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, remedies or other terms and conditions are not taken into account if the lending transaction does not reflect arm's length dealing and the holder does not intend to enforce the remedies or other terms and conditions. For purposes of determining whether interest is unconditionally payable, the possibility of nonpayment due to default, insolvency, or similar circumstances, or due to the exercise of a conversion option described in § 1.1272-1(e) is ignored. This paragraph (c)(1)(ii) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(iii)
Single fixed rate
—(A)
In general.
Interest is payable at a single fixed rate only if the rate appropriately takes into account the length of the interval between payments. Thus, if the interval between payments varies during the term of the debt instrument, the value of the fixed rate on which a payment is based generally must be adjusted to reflect a compounding assumption that is consistent with the length of the interval preceding the payment. See
Example 1
in paragraph (f) of this section.
(B)
Special rule for certain first and final payment intervals.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if a debt instrument provides for payment intervals that are equal in
length throughout the term of the instrument, except that the first or final payment interval differs in length from the other payment intervals, the first or final interest payment is considered to be made at a fixed rate if the value of the rate on which the payment is based is adjusted in any reasonable manner to take into account the length of the interval. See
Example 2
of paragraph (f) of this section. The rule in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) also applies if the lengths of both the first and final payment intervals differ from the length of the other payment intervals.
(2)
Debt instruments subject to contingencies.
The determination of whether a debt instrument described in § 1.1272-1(c) (a debt instrument providing for an alternative payment schedule (or schedules) upon the occurrence of one or more contingencies) provides for qualified stated interest is made by analyzing each alternative payment schedule (including the stated payment schedule) as if it were the debt instrument's sole payment schedule. Under this analysis, the debt instrument provides for qualified stated interest to the extent of the lowest fixed rate at which qualified stated interest would be payable under any payment schedule. See
Example (4)
of paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Variable rate debt instrument.
In the case of a variable rate debt instrument, qualified stated interest is determined under § 1.1275-5(e).
(4)
Stated interest in excess of qualified stated interest.
To the extent that stated interest payable under a debt instrument exceeds qualified stated interest, the excess is included in the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.
(5)
Short-term obligations.
In the case of a debt instrument with a term that is not more than 1 year from the date of issue, no payments of interest are treated as qualified stated interest payments.
(6)
Business day convention
—(i)
Rule.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), if a scheduled payment date for stated interest falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday (within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 6103) but, under the terms of the debt instrument, the stated interest is payable on the first business day that immediately follows the scheduled payment date, the stated interest is treated as payable on the scheduled payment date, provided no additional interest is payable as a result of the deferral.
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section applies to a debt instrument issued on or after September 13, 2012. A taxpayer, however, may rely on paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section for a debt instrument issued before that date.
(d)
De minimis OID
—(1)
In general.
If the amount of OID with respect to a debt instrument is less than the de minimis amount, the amount of OID is treated as zero, and all stated interest (including stated interest that would otherwise be characterized as OID) is treated as qualified stated interest.
(2)
De minimis amount.
The de minimis amount is an amount equal to 0.0025 multiplied by the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date.
(3)
Installment obligations.
In the case of an installment obligation (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), paragraph (d)(2) of this section is applied by substituting for the number of complete years to maturity the weighted average maturity (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section). Alternatively, in the case of a debt instrument that provides for payments of principal no more rapidly than a self-amortizing installment obligation (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section), the de minimis amount defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be calculated by substituting 0.00167 for 0.0025.
(4)
Special rule for interest holidays, teaser rates, and other interest shortfalls
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (d)(4) provides a special rule to determine whether a debt instrument with a teaser rate (or rates), an interest holiday, or any other interest shortfall has de minimis OID. This rule applies if—
(A) The amount of OID on the debt instrument is more than the de minimis amount as otherwise determined under paragraph (d) of this section; and
(B) All stated interest provided for in the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest under paragraph (c) of
this section except that for 1 or more accrual periods the interest rate is below the rate applicable for the remainder of the instrument's term (e.g., if as a result of an interest holiday, none of the stated interest is qualified stated interest).
(ii)
Redetermination of OID for purposes of the de minimis test.
For purposes of determining whether a debt instrument described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section has de minimis OID, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is treated as equal to the instrument's issue price plus the greater of the amount of foregone interest or the excess (if any) of the instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price. The amount of foregone interest is the amount of additional stated interest that would be required to be payable on the debt instrument during the period of the teaser rate, holiday, or shortfall so that all stated interest would be qualified stated interest under paragraph (c) of this section. See
Example 5
and
Example 6
of paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, for purposes of computing the de minimis amount of OID, the weighted average maturity of the debt instrument is determined by treating all stated interest payments as qualified stated interest payments.
(5)
Treatment of de minimis OID by holders
—(i)
Allocation of de minimis OID to principal payments.
The holder of a debt instrument includes any de minimis OID (other than de minimis OID treated as qualified stated interest under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, such as de minimis OID attributable to a teaser rate or interest holiday) in income as stated principal payments are made. The amount includible in income with respect to each principal payment equals the product of the total amount of de minimis OID on the debt instrument and a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the principal payment made and the denominator of which is the stated principal amount of the instrument.
(ii)
Character of de minimis OID
—(A)
De minimis OID treated as gain recognized on retirement.
Any amount of de minimis OID includible in income under this paragraph (d)(5) is treated as gain recognized on retirement of the debt instrument. See section 1271 to determine whether a retirement is treated as an exchange of the debt instrument.
(B)
Treatment of de minimis OID on sale or exchange.
Any gain attributable to de minimis OID that is recognized on the sale or exchange of a debt instrument is capital gain if the debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of the seller.
(iii)
Treatment of subsequent holders.
If a subsequent holder purchases a debt instrument issued with de minimis OID at a premium (as defined in § 1.1272-2(b)(2)), the subsequent holder does not include the de minimis OID in income. Otherwise, a subsequent holder includes any discount in income under the market discount rules (sections 1276 through 1278) rather than under the rules of this paragraph (d)(5).
(iv)
Cross-reference.
See § 1.1272-3 for an election by a holder to treat de minimis OID as OID.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
Installment obligation.
An installment obligation is a debt instrument that provides for the payment of any amount other than qualified stated interest before maturity.
(2)
Self-amortizing installment obligation.
A self-amortizing installment obligation is an obligation that provides for equal payments composed of principal and qualified stated interest that are unconditionally payable at least annually during the entire term of the debt instrument with no significant additional payment required at maturity.
(3)
Weighted average maturity.
The weighted average maturity of a debt instrument is the sum of the following amounts determined for each payment under the instrument (other than a payment of qualified stated interest)—
(i) The number of complete years from the issue date until the payment is made; multiplied by
(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the payment and the denominator of which is the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

# Example 1. Qualified stated interest.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that
matures on January 1, 1999, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for interest payments of $8,000 on January 1, 1996, and January 1, 1997, and quarterly interest payments of $1,942.65, beginning on April 1, 1997.
(ii)
Amount of qualified stated interest.
The annual payments of $8,000 and the quarterly payments of $1,942.65 are payable at a single fixed rate because 8 percent, compounded annually, is equivalent to 7.77 percent, compounded quarterly. Consequently, all stated interest payments under the debt instrument are qualified stated interest payments.

# Example 2. Qualified stated interest with short initial payment interval.
On October 1, 1994, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1998, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for an interest payment of $2,000 on January 1, 1995, and interest payments of $8,000 on January 1, 1996, January 1, 1997, and January 1, 1998. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, all stated interest payments on the debt instrument are computed at a single fixed rate and are qualified stated interest payments.

# Example 3. Stated interest in excess of qualified stated interest.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, B purchases at original issue, for $100,000, C corporation's 5-year debt instrument. The debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $100,000, payable at maturity, and calls for annual interest payments of $10,000 for the first 3 years and annual interest payments of $10,600 for the last 2 years.
(ii)
Payments in excess of qualified stated interest.
All of the first three interest payments and $10,000 of each of the last two interest payments are qualified stated interest payments within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remaining $600 of each of the last two interest payments is included in the stated redemption price at maturity, so that the stated redemption price at maturity is $101,200. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the weighted average maturity of the debt instrument is 4.994 years [(4 years × $600/$101,200) + (5 years × $100,600/$101,200)]. The de minimis amount, or one-fourth of 1 percent of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the weighted average maturity, is $1,263.50. Because the actual amount of discount, $1,200, is less than the de minimis amount, the instrument is treated as having no OID, and, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the interest payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments.

# Example 4. Qualified stated interest on a debt instrument that is subject to an option.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1997, A issues, for $100,000, a 10-year debt instrument that provides for a $100,000 principal payment at maturity and for annual interest payments of $10,000. Under the terms of the debt instrument, A has the option, exercisable on January 1, 2002, to lower the annual interest payments to $8,000. In addition, the debt instrument gives the holder an unconditional right to put the debt instrument back to A, exercisable on January 1, 2002, in return for $100,000.
(ii)
Amount of qualified stated interest.
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the debt instrument provides for qualified stated interest to the extent of the lowest fixed rate at which qualified stated interest would be payable under any payment schedule. If the payment schedule determined by assuming that the issuer's option will be exercised and the put option will not be exercised were treated as the debt instrument's sole payment schedule, only $8,000 of each annual interest payment would be qualified stated interest. Under any other payment schedule, the debt instrument would provide for annual qualified stated interest payments of $10,000. Accordingly, only $8,000 of each annual interest payment is qualified stated interest. Any excess of each annual interest payment over $8,000 is included in the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.

# Example 5. De minimis OID; interest holiday.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, C purchases at original issue, for $97,561, a debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2007, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for an initial interest holiday of 1 quarter and quarterly interest payments of $2,500 thereafter (beginning on July 1, 1995). The issue price of the debt instrument is $97,561. C chooses to accrue OID based on quarterly accrual periods.
(ii)
De minimis amount of OID.
But for the interest holiday, all stated interest on the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the debt instrument has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price at maturity of the instrument is $100,061 ($97,561 (issue price) plus $2,500 (the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($2,500) and the amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument is treated as having OID of $2,500 ($100,061 minus $97,561). Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of $3,001.83 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,061 multiplied by 12 complete years to maturity), the debt instrument is treated as having no OID, and all stated interest is treated as qualified stated interest.

# Example 6. De minimis OID; teaser rate.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
of this paragraph (f) except that C uses an initial semiannual accrual period rather than an initial quarterly accrual period.
(ii)
De minimis amount of OID.
The debt instrument provides for an initial teaser rate because the interest rate for the semiannual accrual period is less than the interest rate applicable to the subsequent quarterly accrual periods. But for the initial teaser rate, all stated interest on the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the debt instrument has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price at maturity of the instrument is $100,123.50 ($97,561 (issue price) plus $2,562.50 (the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($2,562.50) and the amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument is treated as having OID of $2,562.50 ($100,123.50 minus $97,561). Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of $3,003.71 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,123.50 multiplied by 12 complete years to maturity), the debt instrument is treated as having no OID, and all stated interest is treated as qualified stated interest.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4815, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30141, June 14, 1996; T.D. 9599, 77 FR 56536, Sept. 13, 2012]
§ 1.1273-2
Determination of issue price and issue date.
(a)
Debt instruments issued for money
—(1)
Issue price.
If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is issued for money, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt instruments is sold for money. Thus, if an issue consists of a single debt instrument that is issued for money, the issue price of the debt instrument is the amount paid for the instrument. For example, in the case of a debt instrument evidencing a loan to a natural person, the issue price of the instrument is the amount loaned. See § 1.1275-2(d) for rules regarding Treasury securities. For purposes of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See § 1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property.
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the first settlement date or closing date, whichever is applicable, on which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue is sold for money.
(b)
Publicly traded debt instruments issued for property
—(1)
Issue price.
If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is traded on an established market (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) and the issue is not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the debt instrument, determined as of the issue date (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). See paragraph (f) of this section for rules to determine the fair market value of a debt instrument for purposes of this section.
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount of the traded debt instruments in the issue is issued.
(c)
Debt instruments issued for publicly traded property
—(1)
Issue price.
If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is issued for property that is traded on an established market (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) and the issue is not described in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the property, determined as of the issue date (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For purposes of the preceding sentence, property means a debt instrument, stock, security, contract, commodity, or nonfunctional currency. But see § 1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules to determine the fair market value of property for purposes of this section.
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue is issued for traded property.
(d)
Other debt instruments
—(1)
Issue price.
If an issue of debt instruments is not described in paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is determined as if the debt instrument were a separate issue. If the issue price of a debt instrument that is treated as a separate issue under the preceding
sentence is not determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, and if section 1274 applies to the debt instrument, the issue price of the instrument is determined under section 1274. Otherwise, the issue price of the debt instrument is its stated redemption price at maturity under section 1273(b)(4). See section 1274(c) and § 1.1274-1 to determine if section 1274 applies to a debt instrument.
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the date on which the debt instrument is issued for money or in a sale or exchange.
(e)
Special rule for certain sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons.
For purposes of determining the issue price and issue date of a debt instrument under this section, sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers are ignored.
(f)
Traded on an established market (publicly traded)
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, property (including a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is traded on an established market for purposes of this section if, at any time during the 31-day period ending 15 days after the issue date—
(i) There is a sales price for the property as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
(ii) There are one or more firm quotes for the property as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section; or
(iii) There are one or more indicative quotes for the property as described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(2)
Sales price
—(i)
In general.
A sales price exists if the price for an executed purchase or sale of the property within the 31-day period described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is reasonably available within a reasonable period of time after the sale.
(ii)
Pricing information for a debt instrument.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the price of a debt instrument is considered reasonably available if the sales price (or information sufficient to calculate the sales price) appears in a medium that is made available to issuers of debt instruments, persons that regularly purchase or sell debt instruments (including a price provided only to certain customers or to subscribers), or persons that broker purchases or sales of debt instruments.
(3)
Firm quote.
A firm quote is considered to exist when a price quote is available from at least one broker, dealer, or pricing service (including a price provided only to certain customers or to subscribers) for property and the quoted price is substantially the same as the price for which the person receiving the quoted price could purchase or sell the property. A price quote is considered to be available whether the quote is initiated by a person providing the quote or provided at the request of the person receiving the quote. The identity of the person providing the quote must be reasonably ascertainable for a quote to be considered a firm quote for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3). A quote will be considered a firm quote if the quote is designated as a firm quote by the person providing the quote or if market participants typically purchase or sell, as the case may be, at the quoted price, even if the party providing the quote is not legally obligated to purchase or sell at that price.
(4)
Indicative quote.
An indicative quote is considered to exist when a price quote is available from at least one broker, dealer, or pricing service (including a price provided only to certain customers or to subscribers) for property and the price quote is not a firm quote described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(5)
Presumption that price or quote is equal to fair market value
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the fair market value of property will be presumed to be equal to its sales price or quoted price determined under paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) of this section. If there is more than one sales price under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, more than one quoted price under paragraph (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, or both one or more sales prices under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and quoted prices under paragraph (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, a taxpayer may
use any reasonable method, consistently applied to the same or substantially similar facts, to determine the fair market value. For example, to determine the fair market value under a reasonable method, a taxpayer may consider factors such as (but not necessarily limited to) the timing of each relevant sale or quote in relation to the issue date; whether the price is derived from a sale, a firm quote, or an indicative quote; the size of each relevant sale or quote; or whether the sales price or quote corresponds to pricing information provided by an independent bond or loan pricing service.
(ii)
Special rule for property for which there is only an indicative quote.
If property is described only in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and the taxpayer determines that the quote (or an average of the quotes) materially misrepresents the fair market value of the property, the taxpayer can use any method that provides a reasonable basis to determine the fair market value of the property. A taxpayer must establish that the method chosen more accurately reflects the value of the property than the quote or quotes for the property to use the method provided in this paragraph (f)(5)(ii). For an equity or debt instrument, a volume discount or control premium will not be considered to create a material misrepresentation of value for purposes of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii).
(6)
Exception for small debt issues.
Notwithstanding any other provision in paragraph (f) of this section, a debt instrument will not be treated as traded on an established market if at the time the determination is made the outstanding stated principal amount of the issue that includes the debt instrument does not exceed US$100 million (or, for a debt instrument denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the equivalent amount in the currency in which the debt instrument is denominated).
(7)
Anti-abuse rules
—(i)
Effect of certain temporary restrictions on trading.
If there is any temporary restriction on trading a purpose of which is to avoid the characterization of the property as one that is traded on an established market for Federal income tax purposes, then the property is treated as traded on an established market. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a temporary restriction on trading need not be imposed by the issuer.
(ii)
Artificial pricing information.
If a principal purpose for the existence of any sale or price quotation is to cause the property to be traded on an established market or to materially misrepresent the value of property, that sale or price quotation is disregarded.
(8)
Convertible debt instruments.
A debt instrument is not treated as traded on an established market solely because the debt instrument is convertible into property that is so traded.
(9)
Issuer-holder consistency requirement
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, an issuer must determine whether property is traded on an established market and, if so, the fair market value of the property. An issuer is required to exercise reasonable diligence to determine whether purchases or sales have taken place, the quantity of purchases and sales, the price at which purchases or sales occurred, the existence of firm or indicative quotes, and any other relevant information using the rules provided in paragraph (f) of this section to determine the fair market value of the property. If an issuer determines that property is traded on an established market, the issuer is required to make that determination as well as the fair market value of the property (which can be stated as the issue price of the debt instrument) available to holders in a commercially reasonable fashion, including by electronic publication, within 90 days of the date that the debt instrument is issued. Each determination by an issuer is binding on a holder of the debt instrument unless the holder explicitly discloses that its determination is different from the issuer's determination (for example, the holder determines a different fair market value for the property or determines that the property is not traded on an established market). A holder must describe in the disclosure the reasons for its different determination and, if applicable, how the holder determined the fair market value. A holder's disclosure must be filed on a timely filed
Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. If an issuer for any reason does not make the fair market value or issue price of a debt instrument reasonably available to a holder, the holder must determine the fair market value of the property and issue price of the debt instrument using the rules provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
(ii)
Co-obligors.
If a debt instrument has more than one obligor, the obligors must designate one obligor (issuer) to determine whether property is traded on an established market and, if so, the fair market value of the property and issue price of the debt instrument and make the price available to holders using the rules provided in paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section.
(10)
Effective/applicability dates
—(i) This paragraph (f) applies to a debt instrument issued on or after November 13, 2012.
(ii) For rules applying to a debt instrument issued before November 13, 2012, see paragraph (f) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2011.
(g)
Treatment of certain cash payments incident to lending transactions
—(1)
Applicability.
The provisions of this paragraph (g) apply to cash payments made incident to private lending transactions (including seller financing).
(2)
Payments from borrower to lender
—(i)
Money lending transaction.
In a lending transaction to which section 1273(b)(2) applies, a payment from the borrower to the lender (other than a payment for property or for services provided by the lender, such as commitment fees or loan processing costs) reduces the issue price of the debt instrument evidencing the loan. However, solely for purposes of determining the tax consequences to the borrower, the issue price is not reduced if the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2).
(ii)
Section 1274 transaction.
In a lending transaction to which section 1274 applies, a payment from the buyer-borrower to the seller-lender that is designated as interest or points reduces the stated principal amount of the debt instrument evidencing the loan, but is included in the purchase price of the property. If the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2), however, the issue price of the debt instrument (as otherwise determined under section 1274 and the rule in the preceding sentence) is increased by the amount of the payment to compute the buyer-borrower's interest deductions under section 163.
(3)
Payments from lender to borrower.
A payment from the lender to the borrower in a lending transaction is treated as an amount loaned.
(4)
Payments between lender and third party.
If, as part of a lending transaction, a party other than the borrower (the third party) makes a payment to the lender, that payment is treated in appropriate circumstances as made from the third party to the borrower followed by a payment in the same amount from the borrower to the lender and governed by the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. If, as part of a lending transaction, the lender makes a payment to a third party, that payment is treated in appropriate circumstances as an additional amount loaned to the borrower and then paid by the borrower to the third party. The character of the deemed payment between the borrower and the third party depends on the substance of the transaction.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g).

# Example 1. Payments from borrower to lender in a cash transaction.
(i)
Facts.
A lends $100,000 to B for a term of 10 years. At the time the loan is made, B pays $4,000 in points to A. Assume that the points are not deductible by B under section 461(g)(2) and that the stated redemption price at maturity of the debt instrument is $100,000.
(ii)
Payment results in OID.
Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the issue price of B's debt instrument evidencing the loan is $96,000. Because the amount of OID on the debt instrument ($4,000) is more than a de minimis amount of OID, A accounts for the OID under § 1.1272-1. B accounts for the OID under § 1.163-7.

# Example 2. Payments from borrower to lender in a section 1274 transaction.
(i)
Facts.
A sells property to B for $1,000,000 in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation (within the meaning of § 1.1274-3). In consideration for the property, B gives A $300,000 and issues a 5-year debt instrument that has a stated principal amount of $700,000, payable
at maturity, and that calls for semiannual payments of interest at a rate of 8.5 percent. In addition to the cash downpayment, B pays A $14,000 designated as points on the loan. Assume that the points are not deductible under section 461(g)(2).
(ii)
Issue price.
Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the stated principal amount of B's debt instrument is −$686,000 ($700,000 minus $14,000). Assuming a test rate of 9 percent, compounded semiannually, the imputed principal amount of B's debt instrument under § 1.1274-2(c)(1) is $686,153. Under § 1.1274-2(b)(1), the issue price of B's debt instrument is the stated principal amount of $686,000. Because the amount of OID on the debt instrument ($700,000−$686,000, or $14,000) is more than a de minimis amount of OID, A accounts for the OID under § 1.1272-1 and B accounts for the OID under § 1.163-7. B's basis in the property purchased is $1,000,000 ($686,000 debt instrument plus $314,000 cash payments).

# Example 3. Payments between lender and third party (seller-paid points).
(i)
Facts.
A sells real property to B for $500,000 in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation (within the meaning of § 1.1274-3). B makes a cash down payment of $100,000 and borrows $400,000 of the purchase price from a lender, L, repayable in annual installments over a term of 15 years calling for interest at a rate of 9 percent, compounded annually. As part of the transaction, A makes a payment of $8,000 to L to facilitate the loan to B.
(ii)
Payment results in a de minimis amount of OID.
Under the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(4) of this section, B is treated as having made an $8,000 payment directly to L and a payment of only $492,000 to A for the property. Thus, B's basis in the property is $492,000. The payment to L reduces the issue price of B's debt instrument to $392,000, resulting in $8,000 of OID ($400,000−$392,000). Because the amount of OID is de minimis under § 1.1273-1(d), L accounts for the de minimis OID under § 1.1273-1(d)(5). But see § 1.1272-3 (election to treat de minimis OID as OID). B accounts for the de minimis OID under § 1.163-7.
(h)
Investment units
—(1)
In general.
Under section 1273(c)(2), an investment unit is treated as if the investment unit were a debt instrument. The issue price of the investment unit is determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, if applicable. The issue price of the investment unit is then allocated between the debt instrument and the property right (or rights) that comprise the unit based on their relative fair market values. If paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this section are not applicable, however, the issue price of the debt instrument that is part of the investment unit is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, whichever is applicable.
(2)
Consistent allocation by holders and issuer.
The issuer's allocation of the issue price of the investment unit is binding on all holders of the investment unit. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly discloses that its allocation is different from the issuer's allocation. Unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the investment unit. See § 1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Convertible debt instruments.
The issue price of a debt instrument includes any amount paid for an option to convert the instrument into stock (or another debt instrument) of either the issuer or a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) or into cash or other property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such stock (or debt instrument). For debt instruments issued on or after February 5, 2013, the term
stock
in the preceding sentence means an equity interest in any entity that is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as either a partnership or a corporation.
(k)
Below-market loans subject to section 7872(b).
The issue price of a below-market loan subject to section 7872(b) (a term loan other than a gift loan) is the issue price determined under this section, reduced by the excess amount determined under section 7872(b)(1).
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Treatment of amounts representing pre-issuance accrued interest
—(1)
Applicability.
Paragraph (m)(2) of this section provides an alternative to the general rule of this section for determining the issue price of a debt instrument if—
(i) A portion of the initial purchase price of the instrument is allocable to interest that has accrued prior to the issue date (pre-issuance accrued interest); and
(ii) The instrument provides for a payment of stated interest on the first payment date within 1 year of the issue date that equals or exceeds the amount of the pre-issuance accrued interest.
(2)
Exclusion of pre-issuance accrued interest from issue price.
If a debt instrument meets the requirements of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the instrument's issue price may be computed by subtracting from the issue price (as otherwise computed under this section) the amount of pre-issuance accrued interest. If the issue price of the debt instrument is computed in this manner, a portion of the stated interest payable on the first payment date must be treated as a return of the excluded pre-issuance accrued interest, rather than as an amount payable on the instrument.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (m) of this section.

# Example:
(i)
Facts.
On January 15, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $1,005, B corporation's debt instrument. The debt instrument provides for a payment of principal of $1,000 on January 1, 2005, and provides for semiannual interest payments of $60 on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995.
(ii)
Determination of pre-issuance accrued interest.
Under paragraphs (m)(1) and (m)(2) of this section, $5 of the $1,005 initial purchase price of the debt instrument is allocable to pre-issuance accrued interest. Accordingly, the debt instrument's issue price may be computed by subtracting the amount of pre-issuance accrued interest ($5) from the issue price otherwise computed under this section ($1,005), resulting in an issue price of $1,000. If the issue price is computed in this manner, $5 of the $60 payment made on July 1, 1995, must be treated as a repayment by B of the pre-issuance accrued interest.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4817, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9599, 77 FR 56536, Sept. 13, 2012; T.D. 9612, 78 FR 8016, Feb. 5, 2013]
§ 1.1274-1
Debt instruments to which section 1274 applies.
(a)
In general.
Subject to the exceptions and limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, section 1274 and this section apply to any debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale or exchange of property. For purposes of section 1274, property includes debt instruments and investment units, but does not include money, services, or the right to use property. For the treatment of certain obligations given in exchange for services or the use of property, see sections 404 and 467. For purposes of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See § 1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property.
(b)
Exceptions
—(1)
Debt instrument with adequate stated interest and no OID.
Section 1274 does not apply to a debt instrument if—
(i) All interest payable on the instrument is qualified stated interest;
(ii) The stated rate of interest is at least equal to the test rate of interest (as defined in § 1.1274-4);
(iii) The debt instrument is not issued in a potentially abusive situation (as defined in § 1.1274-3); and
(iv) No payment from the buyer-borrower to the seller-lender designated as points or interest is made at the time of issuance of the debt instrument.
(2)
Exceptions under sections 1274(c)(1)(B), 1274(c)(3), 1274A(c), and 1275(b)(1)
—(i)
In general.
Sections 1274(c)(1)(B), 1274(c)(3), 1274A(c), and 1275(b)(1) describe certain transactions to which section 1274 does not apply. This paragraph (b)(2) provides certain rules to be used in applying those exceptions.
(ii)
Special rules for certain exceptions under section 1274(c)(3)
—(A)
Determination of sales price for certain sales of farms.
For purposes of section 1274(c)(3)(A), the determination as to whether the sales price cannot exceed $1,000,000 is made without regard to any other exception to, or limitation on, the applicability of section 1274 (e.g., without regard to the special rules regarding sales of principal residences and land transfers between related persons). In addition, the sales price is determined without regard to section 1274 and without regard to any stated interest. The sales price includes the amount of any liability included in the amount realized from the sale or exchange. See § 1.1001-2.
(B)
Sales involving total payments of $250,000 or less.
Under section 1274(c)(3)(C), the determination of the amount of payments due under all debt
instruments and the amount of other consideration to be received is made as of the date of the sale or exchange or, if earlier, the contract date. If the precise amount due under any debt instrument or the precise amount of any other consideration to be received cannot be determined as of that date, section 1274(c)(3)(C) applies only if it can be determined that the maximum of the aggregate amount of payments due under the debt instruments and other consideration to be received cannot exceed $250,000. For purposes of section 1274(c)(3)(C), if a liability is assumed or property is taken subject to a liability, the aggregate amount of payments due includes the outstanding principal balance or adjusted issue price (in the case of an obligation originally issued at a discount) of the obligation.
(C)
Coordination with section 1273 and § 1.1273-2.
In accordance with section 1274(c)(3)(D), section 1274 and this section do not apply if the issue price of a debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale or exchange of property is determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of § 1.1273-2.
(3)
Other exceptions to section 1274
—(i)
Holders of certain below-market instruments.
Section 1274 does not apply to any holder of a debt instrument that is issued in consideration for the sale or exchange of personal use property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of the issuer and that evidences a below-market loan described in section 7872(c)(1).
(ii)
Transactions involving certain demand loans.
Section 1274 does not apply to any debt instrument that evidences a demand loan that is a below-market loan described in section 7872(c)(1).
(iii)
Certain transfers subject to section 1041.
Section 1274 does not apply to any debt instrument issued in consideration for a transfer of property subject to section 1041 (relating to transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce).
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

# Example 1. Single stated rate paid semiannually.
A debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale of nonpublicly traded property in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation calls for the payment of a principal amount of $1,000,000 at the end of a 10-year term and 20 semiannual interest payments of $60,000. Assume that the test rate of interest is 12 percent, compounded semiannually. The debt instrument is not subject to section 1274 because it provides for interest equal to the test rate and all interest payable on the instrument is qualified stated interest.

# Example 2. Sale of farm for debt instrument with contingent interest.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1995, A, an individual, sells to B land used as a farm within the meaning of section 6420(c)(2). As partial consideration for the sale, B issues a debt instrument calling for a single $500,000 payment due in 10 years unless profits from the land in each of the 10 years preceding maturity of the debt instrument exceed a specified amount, in which case B is to make a payment of $1,200,000. The debt instrument does not provide for interest.
(ii)
Total payments may exceed $1,000,000.
Even though the total payments ultimately payable under the contract may be less than $1,000,000, at the time of the sale or exchange it cannot be determined that the sales price cannot exceed $1,000,000. Thus, the sale of the land used as a farm is not an excepted transaction described in section 1274(c)(3)(A).

# Example 3. Sale between related parties subject to section 483(e).
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1995, A, an individual, sells land (not used as a farm within the meaning of section 6420(c)(2)) to A's child B for $650,000. In consideration for the sale, B issues a 10-year debt instrument to A that calls for a payment of $650,000. No other consideration is given. The debt instrument does not provide for interest.
(ii)
Treatment of debt instrument.
For purposes of section 483(e), the $650,000 debt instrument is treated as two separate debt instruments: a $500,000 debt instrument and a $150,000 debt instrument. The $500,000 debt instrument is subject to section 483(e), and accordingly is covered by the exception from section 1274 described in section 1274(c)(3)(F). Because the amount of the payments due as consideration for the sale exceeds $250,000, however, the $150,000 debt instrument is subject to section 1274.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4820, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1274-2
Issue price of debt instruments to which section 1274 applies.
(a)
In general.
If section 1274 applies to a debt instrument, section 1274 and this section determine the issue price of the debt instrument. For rules relating to the determination of the amount and timing of OID to be included in income, see section 1272 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Issue price
—(1)
Debt instruments that provide for adequate stated interest;
stated principal amount.
The issue price of a debt instrument that provides for adequate stated interest is the stated principal amount of the debt instrument. For purposes of section 1274, the stated principal amount of a debt instrument is the aggregate amount of all payments due under the debt instrument, excluding any amount of stated interest. Under § 1.1273-2(g)(2)(ii), however, the stated principal amount of a debt instrument is reduced by any payment from the buyer- borrower to the seller-lender that is designated as interest or points. See
Example 2
of § 1.1273-2(g)(5).
(2)
Debt instruments that do not provide for adequate stated interest; imputed principal amount.
The issue price of a debt instrument that does not provide for adequate stated interest is the imputed principal amount of the debt instrument.
(3)
Debt instruments issued in a potentially abusive situation; fair market value.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, in the case of a debt instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation (as defined in § 1.1274-3), the issue price of the debt instrument is the fair market value of the property received in exchange for the debt instrument, reduced by the fair market value of any consideration other than the debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale or exchange.
(c)
Determination of whether a debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest
—(1)
In general.
A debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest if its stated principal amount is less than or equal to its imputed principal amount. Imputed principal amount means the sum of the present values, as of the issue date, of all payments, including payments of stated interest, due under the debt instrument (determined by using a discount rate equal to the test rate of interest as determined under § 1.1274-4). If a debt instrument has a single fixed rate of interest that is paid or compounded at least annually, and that rate is equal to or greater than the test rate, the debt instrument has adequate stated interest.
(2)
Determination of present value.
The present value of a payment is determined by discounting the payment from the date it becomes due to the date of the sale or exchange at the test rate of interest. To determine present value, a compounding period must be selected, and the test rate must be based on the same compounding period.
(d)
Treatment of certain options.
This paragraph (d) provides rules for determining the issue price of a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies (other than a debt instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation) that is subject to one or more options described in both paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(5) of § 1.1272-1. Under this paragraph (d), an issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that minimizes the instrument's imputed principal amount, and a holder will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that maximizes the instrument's imputed principal amount. If both the issuer and the holder have options, the rules of this paragraph (d) are applied to the options in the order that they may be exercised. Thus, the deemed exercise of one option may eliminate other options that are later in time. See § 1.1272-1(c)(5) to determine the debt instrument's yield and maturity for purposes of determining the accrual of OID with respect to the instrument.
(e)
Mandatory sinking funds.
In determining the issue price of a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies (other than a debt instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation) and that is subject to a mandatory sinking fund provision described in § 1.1272-1(c)(3), the mandatory sinking fund provision is ignored.
(f)
Treatment of variable rate debt instruments
—(1)
Stated interest at a qualified floating rate
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal amount of a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of § 1.1275-5(a)) that provides for stated interest at a qualified floating rate (or rates) is determined by assuming that the instrument provides for a fixed rate of interest for each accrual period to which a qualified floating rate applies. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the assumed
fixed rate in each accrual period is the greater of—
(A) The value of the applicable qualified floating rate as of the first date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated; or
(B) The value of the applicable qualified floating rate as of the date on which the sale or exchange occurs.
(ii)
Interest rate restrictions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if, as a result of interest rate restrictions (such as an interest rate cap), the expected yield of the debt instrument taking the restrictions into account is significantly less than the expected yield of the debt instrument without regard to the restrictions, the interest payments on the debt instrument (other than any fixed interest payments) are treated as contingent payments. Reasonably symmetric interest rate caps and floors, or reasonably symmetric governors, that are fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument do not result in the debt instrument being subject to this rule.
(2)
Stated interest at a single objective rate.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal amount of a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of § 1.1275-5(a)) that provides for stated interest at a single objective rate is determined by treating the interest payments as contingent payments.
(g)
Treatment of contingent payment debt instruments.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if a debt instrument subject to section 1274 provides for one or more contingent payments, the issue price of the debt instrument is the lesser of the instrument's noncontingent principal payments and the sum of the present values of the noncontingent payments (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section). However, if the debt instrument is issued in a potentially abusive situation, the issue price of the debt instrument is the fair market value of the noncontingent payments. For additional rules relating to a debt instrument that provides for one or more contingent payments, see § 1.1275-4. This paragraph (g) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Each example assumes a 30-day month, 360-day year. In addition, each example assumes that the debt instrument is not a qualified debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(b)) and is not issued in a potentially abusive situation.

# Example 1. Debt instrument without a fixed rate over its entire term.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B for a stated purchase price of $3,500,000. In consideration for the sale, B makes a down payment of $500,000 and issues a 10-year debt instrument with a stated principal amount of $3,000,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument calls for no interest in the first 2 years and interest at a rate of 15 percent payable annually over the remaining 8 years of the debt instrument. The first interest payment of $450,000 is due on December 31, 1997, and the last interest payment is due on December 31, 2004, together with the $3,000,000 payment of principal. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to the debt instrument is 10.5 percent, compounded annually.
(ii)
Applicability of section 1274.
Because the debt instrument does not provide for any interest during the first 2 years, none of the interest on the debt instrument is qualified stated interest. Therefore, the issue price of the debt instrument is determined under section 1274. See § 1.1274-1(b)(1). If the debt instrument has adequate stated interest, the issue price of the instrument is its stated principal amount. Otherwise, the issue price of the debt instrument is its imputed principal amount. The debt instrument has adequate stated interest only if the stated principal amount is less than or equal to the imputed principal amount.
(iii)
Determination of imputed principal amount.
To compute the imputed principal amount of the debt instrument, all payments due under the debt instrument are discounted back to the issue date at 10.5 percent, compounded annually, as follows:
(A) The present value of the $3,000,000 principal payment payable on December 31, 2004, is $1,105,346.59, determined as follows:
er02fe94.000
(B) The present value of the eight interest payments of $450,000 as of January 1, 1997, is $2,357,634.55, determined as follows:
er02fe94.001
(C) The present value of this interim amount as of January 1, 1995, is $1,930,865.09, determined as follows:
er02fe94.002
(iv)
Determination of issue price.
The debt instrument's imputed principal amount (that is, the present value of all payments due under the debt instrument) is $3,036,211.68 ($1,105,346.59 + $1,930,865.09). Because the stated principal amount ($3,000,000) is less than the imputed principal amount, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest. Therefore, the issue price of the debt instrument is its stated principal amount ($3,000,000).

# Example 2. Debt instrument subject to issuer call option.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, in partial consideration for the sale of nonpublicly traded property, H corporation issues to G a 10-year debt instrument, maturing on January 1, 2005, with a stated principal amount of $10,000,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of 8 percent for the first 5 years and 14 percent for the final 5 years, payable on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. In addition the debt instrument provides H with the unconditional option to call (prepay) the debt instrument at the end of 5 years for its stated principal amount of $10,000,000. Assume that the Federal mid-term and long-term rates applicable to the sale based on annual compounding are 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
(ii)
Option presumed exercised.
Assuming exercise of the call option, the imputed principal amount as determined under paragraph (d) of this section is $9,611,034.87 (the present value of all of the payments due within a 5-year term discounted at a test rate of 9 percent, compounded annually). Assuming nonexercise of the call option, the imputed principal amount is $10,183,354.78 (the present value of all of the payments due within a 10-year term discounted at a test rate of 10 percent, compounded annually). For purposes of determining the imputed principal amount, the option is presumed exercised because the imputed principal amount, assuming exercise of the option, is less than the imputed principal amount, assuming the option is not exercised. Because the option is presumed exercised, the debt instrument fails to provide for adequate stated interest because the imputed principal amount ($9,611,034.87) is less than the stated principal amount ($10,000,000). Thus, the issue price of the debt instrument is $9,611,034.87.

# Example 3. Variable rate debt instrument with a single rate over its entire term.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, A sells B nonpublicly traded property. In partial consideration for the sale, B issues a debt instrument in the principal amount of $1,000,000, payable in 5 years. The debt instrument calls for interest payable monthly at a rate of 1 percentage point above the average prime lending rate of a major bank for the month preceding the month of the interest payment. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to the debt instrument is 10.5 percent, compounded monthly. Assume also that 1 percentage point above the prime lending rate of the designated bank on the date of the sale is 12.5 percent, compounded monthly, which is greater than 1 percentage point above the prime lending rate of the designated bank on the first date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale is consummated.
(ii)
Debt instrument has adequate stated interest.
The debt instrument is a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of § 1.1275-5) that provides for stated interest at a qualified floating rate. Under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the debt instrument is treated as if it provided for a fixed rate of interest equal to 12.5 percent, compounded monthly. Because the test rate of interest is 10.5 percent, compounded monthly, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest.

# Example 4. Debt instrument with a capped variable rate.
On July 1, 1995, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in return for a debt instrument with a stated principal amount of $10,000,000, payable on July 1, 2005. Interest is payable on July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1996, at the Federal short-term rate for June of the same year. The debt instrument provides, however, that the interest rate cannot rise above 8.5 percent, compounded annually. Assume that, as of the date the test rate of interest for the debt instrument is determined, the Federal short-term rate is 8 percent, compounded annually. Assume further that, as a result of the interest rate cap of 8.5 percent, compounded annually, the expected yield of the debt instrument is significantly less than the expected yield of the debt instrument if it did not include the interest rate cap. Under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the variable payments are treated as contingent payments for purposes of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Special rules for tax-exempt obligations
—(1)
Certain variable rate debt instruments.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) is a variable rate debt instrument
(within the meaning of § 1.1275-5) that pays interest at an objective rate and is subject to section 1274, the issue price of the obligation is the greater of the obligation's fair market value and its stated principal amount.
(2)
Contingent payment debt instruments.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (g) of this section, if a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) is subject to section 1274 and § 1.1275-4, the issue price of the obligation is the fair market value of the obligation. However, in the case of a tax-exempt obligation that is subject to § 1.1275-4(d)(2) (an obligation that provides for interest-based or revenue-based payments), the issue price of the obligation is the greater of the obligation's fair market value and its stated principal amount.
(3)
Effective date.
This paragraph (j) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4821, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30141, June 14, 1996]
§ 1.1274-3
Potentially abusive situations defined.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 1274, a potentially abusive situation means-—
(1) A tax shelter (as defined in section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii)); or
(2) Any other situation involving—
(i) A recent sales transaction;
(ii) Nonrecourse financing;
(iii) Financing with a term in excess of the useful life of the property; or
(iv) A debt instrument with clearly excessive interest.
(b)
Operating rules
—(1)
Debt instrument exchanged for nonrecourse financing.
Nonrecourse financing does not include an exchange of a nonrecourse debt instrument for an outstanding recourse or nonrecourse debt instrument.
(2)
Nonrecourse debt with substantial down payment.
Nonrecourse financing does not include a sale or exchange of a real property interest financed by a nonrecourse debt instrument if, in addition to the nonrecourse debt instrument, the purchaser makes a down payment in money that equals or exceeds 20 percent of the total stated purchase price of the real property interest. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a real property interest means any interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, in real property.
(3)
Clearly excessive interest.
Interest on a debt instrument is clearly excessive if the interest, in light of the terms of the debt instrument and the creditworthiness of the borrower, is clearly greater than the arm's length amount of interest that would have been charged in a cash lending transaction between the same two parties.
(4)
Debt-for-debt exchange
—(i)
Rule.
A debt instrument issued in a debt-for-debt exchange, including a deemed exchange under § 1.1001-3, will not be treated as the subject of a recent sales transaction for purposes of section 1274(b)(3)(B)(ii)(I) even if the debt instrument exchanged for the newly issued debt instrument was recently acquired prior to the exchange. Therefore, the issue price of the debt instrument will not be determined under section 1274(b)(3). However, if the debt instrument or the property for which the debt instrument is issued is publicly traded within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f), the rules of § 1.1273-2 will apply to determine the issue price of the debt instrument.
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section applies to a debt instrument issued on or after November 13, 2012.
(c)
Other situations to be specified by Commissioner.
The Commissioner may designate in the Internal Revenue Bulletin situations that, although described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, will not be treated as potentially abusive because they do not have the effect of significantly misstating basis or amount realized (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(d)
Consistency rule.
The issuer's determination that the debt instrument is or is not issued in a potentially abusive situation is binding on all holders of the debt instrument. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder who explicitly discloses a position that is inconsistent with the issuer's determination. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. See
§ 1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4822, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9599, 77 FR 56538, Sept. 13, 2012]
§ 1.1274-4
Test rate.
(a)
Determination of test rate of interest
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Test rate is the 3-month rate.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the test rate of interest for a debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale or exchange of property is the 3-month rate.
(ii)
The 3-month rate.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the 3-month rate is the lower of—
(A) The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the first month in which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated; or
(B) The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange occurs.
(iii)
Special rule if there is no binding written contract.
If there is no binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated, the 3-month rate is the lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange occurs.
(2)
Test rate for certain debt instruments
—(i)
Sale-leaseback transactions.
Under section 1274(e) (relating to certain sale-leaseback transactions), the test rate is 110 percent of the 3-month rate determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For purposes of section 1274(e)(3), related party means a person related to the transferor within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1).
(ii)
Qualified debt instrument.
Under section 1274A(a), the test rate for a qualified debt instrument is no greater than 9 percent, compounded semiannually, or an equivalent rate based on an appropriate compounding period.
(iii)
Alternative test rate for short-term obligations
—(A)
Requirements.
This paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) provides an alternative test rate under section 1274(d)(1)(D) for a debt instrument with a maturity of 1 year or less. This alternative test rate applies, however, only if the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest using the alternative test rate, the issuer provides on the face of the debt instrument that the instrument qualifies as having adequate stated interest under section 1274(d)(1)(D), and the issuer and holder treat or agree to treat the instrument as having adequate stated interest.
(B)
Alternative test rate.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A), the alternative test rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury bills with the same maturity date as the debt instrument. If the same maturity date is not available, the market yield on U.S. Treasury bills that mature in the same week or month as the debt instrument is used. The alternative test rate is determined as of the date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated or as of the date of the sale or exchange, whichever date results in a lower rate. If there is no binding written contract, however, the alternative test rate is determined as of the date of the sale or exchange.
(b)
Applicable Federal rate.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the applicable Federal rate for a debt instrument is based on the term of the instrument (i.e., short-term, mid-term, or long-term). See section 1274(d)(1). The Internal Revenue Service publishes the applicable Federal rates for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). The applicable Federal rates are based on the yield to maturity of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of similar maturities during the one month period ending on the 14th day of the month preceding the month for which the rates are applicable.
(c)
Special rules to determine the term of a debt instrument for purposes of determining the applicable Federal rate
—(1)
Installment obligation.
If a debt instrument is an installment obligation (as defined in § 1.1273-1(e)(1)), the term of the instrument is the instrument's weighted average maturity (as defined in § 1.1273-1(e)(3)).
(2)
Certain variable rate debt instruments
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if a variable rate debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-5(a)) provides for stated interest at a qualified floating rate (or rates), the term of the instrument is determined by reference to the longest interval between interest adjustment dates, or, if the variable rate debt instrument provides for a fixed rate, the interval between the issue date and the last day on which the fixed rate applies, if this interval is longer.
(ii)
Restrictions on adjustments.
If, due to significant restrictions on variations in a qualified floating rate or the use of certain formulae pursuant to § 1.1275-5(b)(2) (e.g., 15 percent of 1-year LIBOR, plus 800 basis points), the rate in substance resembles a fixed rate, the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to the term of the debt instrument.
(3)
Counting of either the issue date or the maturity date.
The term of a debt instrument includes either the issue date or the maturity date, but not both dates.
(4)
Certain debt instruments that provide for principal payments uncertain as to time.
If a debt instrument provides for principal payments that are fixed in total amount but uncertain as to time, the term of the instrument is determined by reference to the latest possible date on which a principal payment can be made or, in the case of an installment obligation, by reference to the longest weighted average maturity under any possible payment schedule.
(d)
Foreign currency loans.
If all of the payments of a debt instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument is a foreign currency rate of interest that is analogous to the applicable Federal rate described in this section. For this purpose, an analogous rate of interest is a rate based on yields (with the appropriate compounding period) of the highest grade of outstanding marketable obligations denominated in such currency (excluding any obligations that benefit from special tax exemptions or preferential tax rates not available to debt instruments generally) with due consideration given to the maturities of the obligations.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

# Example 1. Variable rate debt instrument that limits the amount of increase and decrease in the rate.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1996, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in return for a 5-year debt instrument that provides for interest to be paid on July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1997, based on the prime rate of a local bank on that date. However, the interest rate cannot increase or decrease from one year to the next by more than .25 percentage points (25 basis points).
(ii)
Significant restriction.
The debt instrument is a variable rate debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-5) that provides for stated interest at a qualified floating rate. Assume that based on all the facts and circumstances, the restriction is a significant restriction on the variations in the rate of interest. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to the term of the debt instrument, and the applicable Federal rate is the Federal mid-term rate.

# Example 2. Installment obligation.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1996, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in exchange for a debt instrument that calls for a payment of $500,000 on January 1, 2001, and a payment of $1,000,000 on January 1, 2006. The debt instrument does not provide for any stated interest.
(ii)
Determination of term.
The debt instrument is an installment obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the term of the debt instrument is its weighted average maturity (as defined in § 1.1273-1(e)(3)). The debt instrument's weighted average maturity is 8.33 years, which is the sum of (A) the ratio of the first payment to total payments (500,000/1,500,000), multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date until the payment is due (5 years), and (B) the ratio of the second payment to total payments (1,000,000/1,500,000), multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date until the second payment is due (10 years).
(iii)
Applicable Federal rate.
Based on the calculation in paragraph (ii) of this example, the term of the debt instrument is treated as 8.33 years. Consequently, the applicable Federal rate is the Federal mid-term rate.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4823, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1274-5
Assumptions.
(a)
In general.
Section 1274 does not apply to a debt instrument if the debt instrument is assumed, or property is taken subject to the debt instrument, in connection with a sale or exchange of property, unless the terms of the debt instrument, as part of the sale or exchange, are modified in a manner that would constitute an exchange under section 1001.
(b)
Modifications of debt instruments
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a debt instrument is assumed, or property is taken subject to a debt instrument, in connection with a sale or exchange of property, the terms of the debt instrument are modified as part of the sale or exchange, and the modification triggers an exchange under section 1001, the modification is treated as a separate transaction taking place immediately before the sale or exchange and is attributed to the seller of the property. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a debt instrument is not considered to be modified as part of the sale or exchange unless the seller knew or had reason to know about the modification.
(2)
Election to treat buyer as modifying the debt instrument
—(i)
In general.
Rather than having the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply, the seller and buyer may jointly elect to treat the transaction as one in which the buyer first assumed the original (unmodified) debt instrument and then subsequently modified the debt instrument. For this purpose, the modification is treated as a separate transaction taking place immediately after the sale or exchange.
(ii)
Time and manner of making the election.
The buyer and seller make the election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section by jointly signing a statement that includes the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of the seller and buyer, and a clear indication that the election is being made under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Both the buyer and the seller must sign this statement not later than the earlier of the last day (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return of the buyer or seller for the taxable year in which the sale or exchange of the property occurs. The buyer and seller should attach this signed statement (or a copy thereof) to their timely filed Federal income tax returns.
(c)
Wraparound indebtedness.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the issuance of wraparound indebtedness is not considered an assumption.
(d)
Consideration attributable to assumed debt.
If, as part of the consideration for the sale or exchange of property, the buyer assumes, or takes the property subject to, an indebtedness that was issued with OID (including a debt instrument issued in a prior sale or exchange to which section 1274 applied), the portion of the buyer's basis in the property and the seller's amount realized attributable to the debt instrument equals the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument as of the date of the sale or exchange.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4824, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1274A-1
Special rules for certain transactions where stated principal amount does not exceed $2,800,000.
(a)
In general.
Section 1274A allows the use of a lower test rate for purposes of sections 483 and 1274 in the case of a qualified debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(b)) and, if elected by the borrower and the lender, the use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for interest on a cash method debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(c)(2)). This section provides special rules for qualified debt instruments and cash method debt instruments.
(b)
Rules for both qualified and cash method debt instruments
—(1)
Sale-leaseback transactions.
A debt instrument issued in a sale-leaseback transaction (within the meaning of section 1274(e)) cannot be either a qualified debt instrument or a cash method debt instrument.
(2)
Debt instruments calling for contingent payments.
A debt instrument that provides for contingent payments cannot be a qualified debt instrument unless it can be determined at the time of the sale or exchange that the maximum stated principal amount due under the debt instrument cannot exceed the amount specified in section 1274A(b). Similarly, a debt instrument
that provides for contingent payments cannot be a cash method debt instrument unless it can be determined at the time of the sale or exchange that the maximum stated principal amount due under the debt instrument cannot exceed the amount specified in section 1274A(c)(2)(A).
(3)
Aggregation of transactions
—(i)
General rule.
The aggregation rules of section 1274A(d)(1) are applied using a facts and circumstances test.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of section 1274A(d)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 1. Aggregation of two sales to a single person.
In two transactions evidenced by separate sales agreements, A sells undivided half interests in Blackacre to B. The sales are pursuant to a plan for the sale of a 100 percent interest in Blackacre to B. These sales or exchanges are part of a series of related transactions and, thus, are treated as a single sale for purposes of section 1274A.

# Example 2. Aggregation of two purchases by unrelated individuals.
Pursuant to a plan, unrelated individuals X and Y purchase undivided half interests in Blackacre from A and subsequently contribute these interests to a partnership in exchange for equal interests in the partnership. These purchases are treated as part of the same transaction and, thus, are treated as a single sale for purposes of section 1274A.

# Example 3. Aggregation of sales made pursuant to a tender offer.
Fifteen unrelated individuals own all of the stock of X Corporation. Y Corporation makes a tender offer to these 15 shareholders. The terms offered to each shareholder are identical. Shareholders holding a majority of the shares of X Corporation elect to tender their shares pursuant to Y Corporation's offer. These sales are part of the same transaction and, thus, are treated as a single sale for purposes of section 1274A.

# Example 4. No aggregation for separate sales of similar property to unrelated persons.
Pursuant to a newspaper advertisement, X Corporation offers for sale similar condominiums in a single building. The prices of the units vary due to a variety of factors, but the financing terms offered by X Corporation to all buyers are identical. The units are purchased by unrelated buyers who decided whether to purchase units in the building at the price and on the terms offered by X Corporation, without regard to the actions of other buyers. Because each buyer acts individually, the sales are not part of the same transaction or a series of related transactions and, thus, are treated as separate sales.
(4)
Inflation adjustment of dollar amounts.
Under section 1274A(d)(2), the dollar amounts specified in sections 1274A(b) and 1274A(c)(2)(A) are adjusted for inflation. The dollar amounts, adjusted for inflation, are published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(c)
Rules for cash method debt instruments
—(1)
Time and manner of making cash method election.
The borrower and lender make the election described in section 1274A(c)(2)(D) by jointly signing a statement that includes the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of the borrower and lender, a clear indication that an election is being made under section 1274A(c)(2), and a declaration that the debt instrument with respect to which the election is being made fulfills the requirements of a cash method debt instrument. Both the borrower and the lender must sign this statement not later than the earlier of the last day (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return of the borrower or lender for the taxable year in which the debt instrument is issued. The borrower and lender should attach this signed statement (or a copy thereof) to their timely filed Federal income tax returns.
(2)
Successors of electing parties.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), the cash method election under section 1274A(c) applies to any successor of the electing lender or borrower. Thus, for any period after the transfer of a cash method debt instrument, the successor takes into account the interest (including unstated interest) on the instrument under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Nevertheless, if the lender (or any successor thereof) transfers the cash method debt instrument to a taxpayer who uses an accrual method of accounting, section 1272 rather than section 1274A(c) applies to the successor of the lender with respect to the debt instrument for any period after the date of the transfer. The borrower (or any successor thereof), however, remains on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting with respect to the cash method debt instrument.
(3)
Modified debt instrument.
In the case of a debt instrument issued in a debt-for-debt exchange that qualifies as an exchange under section 1001, the debt instrument is eligible for the election to be a cash method debt instrument if the other prerequisites to making the election in section 1274A(c) are met. However, if a principal purpose of the modification is to defer interest income or deductions through the use of the election, then the debt instrument is not eligible for the election.
(4)
Debt incurred or continued to purchase or carry a cash method debt instrument.
If a debt instrument is incurred or continued to purchase or carry a cash method debt instrument, rules similar to those under section 1277 apply to determine the timing of the interest deductions for the debt instrument. For purposes of the preceding sentence, rules similar to those under section 265(a)(2) apply to determine whether a debt instrument is incurred or continued to purchase or carry a cash method debt instrument.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4824, Feb. 2, 1994]
§ 1.1275-1
Definitions.
(a)
Applicability.
The definitions contained in this section apply for purposes of sections 163(e) and 1271 through 1275 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Adjusted issue price
—(1)
In general.
The adjusted issue price of a debt instrument at the beginning of the first accrual period is the issue price. Thereafter, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt instrument—
(i) Increased by the amount of OID previously includible in the gross income of any holder (determined without regard to section 1272(a)(7) and section 1272(c)(1)); and
(ii) Decreased by the amount of any payment previously made on the debt instrument other than a payment of qualified stated interest. See § 1.1275-2(f) for rules regarding adjustments to adjusted issue price on a pro rata prepayment.
(2)
Bond issuance premium.
If a debt instrument is issued with bond issuance premium (as defined in § 1.163-13(c)), for purposes of determining the issuer's adjusted issue price, the adjusted issue price determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is also decreased by the amount of bond issuance premium previously allocable under § 1.163-13(d)(3).
(3)
Adjusted issue price for subsequent holders.
For purposes of calculating OID accruals, acquisition premium, or market discount, a holder (other than a purchaser at original issuance) determines adjusted issue price in any manner consistent with the regulations under sections 1271 through 1275.
(c)
OID.
OID means original issue discount (as defined in section 1273(a) and § 1.1273-1).
(d)
Debt instrument.
Except as provided in section 1275(a)(1)(B) (relating to certain annuity contracts; see paragraph (j) of this section), debt instrument means any instrument or contractual arrangement that constitutes indebtedness under general principles of Federal income tax law (including, for example, a certificate of deposit or a loan). Nothing in the regulations under sections 163(e), 483, and 1271 through 1275, however, shall influence whether an instrument constitutes indebtedness for Federal income tax purposes. See § 1.385-3 for rules that treat certain instruments that otherwise would be treated as indebtedness as stock for Federal tax purposes.
(e)
Tax-exempt obligations.
For purposes of section 1275(a)(3)(B), exempt from tax means exempt from Federal income tax.
(f)
Issue.
(1)
Debt instruments issued on or after March 13, 2001.
(2)
Debt instruments issued before March 13, 2001.
(3)
Transition rule.
(4)
Cross-references for reopening and aggregation rules.
(g)
Debt instruments issued by a natural person.
If an entity is a primary obligor under a debt instrument, the debt instrument is considered to be issued by the entity and not by a natural person even if a natural person is a co-maker and is jointly liable for the debt instrument's repayment. A debt instrument issued by a partnership is considered to be issued by the partnership as an entity even if the partnership is composed entirely of natural persons.
(h)
Publicly offered debt instrument.
A debt instrument is publicly offered if it is part of an issue of debt instruments the initial offering of which—
(1) Is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or
(2) Would be required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a
et seq.
) but for an exemption from registration—
(i) Under section 3 of the Securities Act of 1933 (relating to exempted securities);
(ii) Under any law (other than the Securities Act of 1933) because of the identity of the issuer or the nature of the security; or
(iii) Because the issue is intended for distribution to persons who are not United States persons.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Life annuity exception under section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i)
—(1)
Purpose.
Section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i) excepts an annuity contract from the definition of
debt instrument
if section 72 applies to the contract and the contract depends (in whole or in substantial part) on the life expectancy of one or more individuals. This paragraph (j) provides rules to ensure that an annuity contract qualifies for the exception in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i) only in cases where the life contingency under the contract is real and significant.
(2)
General rule
—(i)
Rule.
For purposes of section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i), an annuity contract depends (in whole or in substantial part) on the life expectancy of one or more individuals only if—
(A) The contract provides for periodic distributions made not less frequently than annually for the life (or joint lives) of an individual (or a reasonable number of individuals); and
(B) The contract does not contain any terms or provisions that can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants).
(ii)
Terminology.
For purposes of this paragraph (j):
(A)
Contract.
The term
contract
includes all written or unwritten understandings among the parties as well as any person or persons acting in concert with one or more of the parties.
(B)
Annuitant.
The term
annuitant
refers to the individual (or reasonable number of individuals) referred to in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(C)
Terminating death.
The phrase
terminating death
refers to the annuitant death that can terminate periodic distributions under the contract. (See paragraph (j)(2)(i)(A) of this section.) For example, if a contract provides for periodic distributions until the later of the death of the last-surviving annuitant or the end of a term certain, the terminating death is the death of the last-surviving annuitant.
(iii)
Coordination with specific rules.
Paragraphs (j) (3) through (7) of this section describe certain terms and conditions that can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). If a term or provision is not specifically described in paragraphs (j) (3) through (7) of this section, the annuity contract must be tested under the general rule of paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section to determine whether it depends (in whole or in substantial part) on the life expectancy of one or more individuals.
(3)
Availability of a cash surrender option
—(i)
Impact on life contingency.
The availability of a cash surrender option can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). Thus, the availability of any cash surrender option causes the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i). A cash surrender option is available if there is reason to believe that the issuer (or a person acting in concert with the issuer) will be willing to terminate or purchase all or a part of the annuity contract by making one or more payments of cash or property (other than an annuity contract described in this paragraph (j)).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (j)(3):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to A for cash. The contract provides that, effective on any date chosen by A (the annuity starting date), X will begin equal monthly distributions for A's
life. The amount of each monthly distribution will be no less than an amount based on the contract's account value as of the annuity starting date, A's age on that date, and permanent purchase rate guarantees contained in the contract. The contract also provides that, at any time before the annuity starting date, A may surrender the contract to X for the account value less a surrender charge equal to a declining percentage of the account value. For this purpose, the initial account value is equal to the cash invested. Thereafter, the account value increases annually by at least a minimum guaranteed rate.
(ii)
Analysis.
The ability to obtain the account value less the surrender charge, if any, is a cash surrender option. This ability can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with A's longevity. Thus, the contract fails to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to B for cash. The contract provides that beginning on March 1, 1999, X will distribute to B a fixed amount of cash each month for B's life. Based on X's advertisements, marketing literature, or illustrations or on oral representations by X's sales personnel, there is reason to believe that an affiliate of X stands ready to purchase B's contract for its commuted value.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because there is reason to believe that an affiliate of X stands ready to purchase B's contract for its commuted value, a cash surrender option is available within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section. This availability can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with B's longevity. Thus, the contract fails to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(4)
Availability of a loan secured by the contract
—(i)
Impact on life contingency.
The availability of a loan secured by the contract can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). Thus, the availability of any such loan causes the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i). A loan secured by the contract is available if there is reason to believe that the issuer (or a person acting in concert with the issuer) will be willing to make a loan that is directly or indirectly secured by the annuity contract.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (j)(4):

# Example:
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to C for $100,000. The contract provides that, effective on any date chosen by C (the annuity starting date), X will begin equal monthly distributions for C's life. The amount of each monthly distribution will be no less than an amount based on the contract's account value as of the annuity starting date, C's age on that date, and permanent purchase rate guarantees contained in the contract. From marketing literature circulated by Y, there is reason to believe that, at any time before the annuity starting date, C may pledge the contract to borrow up to $75,000 from Y. Y is acting in concert with X.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because there is reason to believe that Y, a person acting in concert with X, is willing to lend money against C's contract, a loan secured by the contract is available within the meaning of paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section. This availability can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with C's longevity. Thus, the contract fails to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(5)
Minimum payout provision
—(i)
Impact on life contingency.
The existence of a minimum payout provision can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). Thus, the existence of any minimum payout provision causes the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(ii)
Definition of minimum payout provision.
A minimum payout provision is a contractual provision (for example, an agreement to make distributions over a term certain) that provides for one or more distributions made—
(A) After the terminating death under the contract; or
(B) By reason of the death of any individual (including distributions triggered by or increased by terminal or chronic illness, as defined in section 101(g)(1) (A) and (B)).
(iii)
Exceptions for certain minimum payouts
—(A)
Recovery of consideration paid for the contract.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) and (j)(5)(i) of this section, a contract does not fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i) merely because it provides that, after the terminating death, there will be one or more distributions that, in the aggregate, do not exceed the consideration paid for the contract less total
distributions previously made under the contract.
(B)
Payout for one-half of life expectancy.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) and (j)(5)(i) of this section, a contract does not fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i) merely because it provides that, if the terminating death occurs after the annuity starting date, distributions under the contract will continue to be made after the terminating death until a date that is no later than the halfway date. This exception does not apply unless the amounts distributed in each contract year will not exceed the amounts that would have been distributed in that year if the terminating death had not occurred until the expected date of the terminating death, determined under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(C) of this section.
(C)
Definition of halfway date.
For purposes of this paragraph (j)(5)(iii), the halfway date is the date halfway between the annuity starting date and the expected date of the terminating death, determined as of the annuity starting date, with respect to all then-surviving annuitants. The expected date of the terminating death must be determined by reference to the applicable mortality table prescribed under section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I).
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (j)(5):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to D for cash. The contract provides that, effective on any date D chooses (the annuity starting date), X will begin equal monthly distributions for the greater of D's life or 10 years, regardless of D's age as of the annuity starting date. The amount of each monthly distribution will be no less than an amount based on the contract's account value as of the annuity starting date, D's age on that date, and permanent purchase rate guarantees contained in the contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
A minimum payout provision exists because, if D dies within 10 years of the annuity starting date, one or more distributions will be made after D's death. The minimum payout provision does not qualify for the exception in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B) of this section because D may defer the annuity starting date until his remaining life expectancy is less than 20 years. If, on the annuity starting date, D's life expectancy is less than 20 years, the minimum payout period (10 years) will last beyond the halfway date. The minimum payout provision, therefore, can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with D's longevity. Thus, the contract fails to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (j)(5)(iv) except that the monthly distributions will last for the greater of D's life or a term certain. D may choose the length of the term certain subject to the restriction that, on the annuity starting date, the term certain must not exceed one-half of D's life expectancy as of the annuity starting date. The contract also does not provide for any adjustment in the amount of distributions by reason of the death of D or any other individual, except for a refund of D's aggregate premium payments less the sum of all prior distributions under the contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
The minimum payout provision qualifies for the exception in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B) of this section because distributions under the minimum payout provision will not continue past the halfway date and the contract does not provide for any adjustments in the amount of distributions by reason of the death of D or any other individual, other than a guaranteed death benefit described in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the existence of this minimum payout provision does not prevent the contract from being described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(6)
Maximum payout provision
—(i)
Impact on life contingency.
The existence of a maximum payout provision can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). Thus, the existence of any maximum payout provision causes the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(ii)
Definition of maximum payout provision.
A maximum payout provision is a contractual provision that provides that no distributions under the contract may be made after some date (the termination date), even if the terminating death has not yet occurred.
(iii)
Exception.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) and (j)(6)(i) of this section, an annuity contract does not fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i) merely because the contract contains a maximum payout provision, provided that the period of time from the annuity starting date to the termination date is at least twice as long as the period of time from the annuity starting date to the expected
date of the terminating death, determined as of the annuity starting date, with respect to all then-surviving annuitants. The expected date of the terminating death must be determined by reference to the applicable mortality table prescribed under section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I).
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (j)(6):

# Example:
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to E for cash. The contract provides that beginning on April 1, 1998, X will distribute to E a fixed amount of cash each month for E's life but that no distributions will be made after April 1, 2018. On April 1, 1998, E's life expectancy is 9 years.
(ii)
Analysis.
A maximum payout provision exists because if E survives beyond April 1, 2018, E will receive no further distributions under the contract. The period of time from the annuity starting date (April 1, 1998) to the termination date (April 1, 2018) is 20 years. Because this 20-year period is more than twice as long as E's life expectancy on April 1, 1998, the maximum payout provision qualifies for the exception in paragraph (j)(6)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, the existence of this maximum payout provision does not prevent the contract from being described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(7)
Decreasing payout provision
—(i)
General rule.
If the amount of distributions during any contract year (other than the last year during which distributions are made) may be less than the amount of distributions during the preceding year, this possibility can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants). Thus, the existence of this possibility causes the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(ii)
Exception for certain variable distributions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(7)(i) of this section, if an annuity contract provides that the amount of each distribution must increase and decrease in accordance with investment experience, cost of living indices, or similar fluctuating criteria, then the possibility that the amount of a distribution may decrease for this reason does not significantly reduce the probability that the distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with the longevity of the annuitant (or annuitants).
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (j)(7):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to F for $100,000. The contract provides that beginning on March 1, 1999, X will make distributions to F each year until F's death. Prior to March 1, 2009, distributions are to be made at a rate of $12,000 per year. Beginning on March 1, 2009, distributions are to be made at a rate of $3,000 per year.
(ii)
Analysis.
If F is alive in 2009, the amount distributed in 2009 ($3,000) will be less than the amount distributed in 2008 ($12,000). The exception in paragraph (j)(7)(ii) of this section does not apply. The decrease in the amount of any distributions made on or after March 1, 2009, can significantly reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with F's longevity. Thus, the contract fails to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
On March 1, 1998, X issues a contract to G for cash. The contract provides that, effective on any date G chooses (the annuity starting date), X will begin monthly distributions to G for G's life. Prior to the annuity starting date, the account value of the contract reflects the investment return, including changes in the market value, of an identifiable pool of assets. When G chooses the annuity starting date, G must also choose whether the distributions are to be fixed or variable. If fixed, the amount of each monthly distribution will remain constant at an amount that is no less than an amount based on the contract's account value as of the annuity starting date, G's age on that date, and permanent purchase rate guarantees contained in the contract. If variable, the monthly distributions will fluctuate to reflect the investment return, including changes in the market value, of the pool of assets. The monthly distributions under the contract will not otherwise decline from year to year.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the only possible year-to-year declines in annuity distributions are described in paragraph (j)(7)(ii) of this section, the possibility that the amount of distributions may decline from the previous year does not reduce the probability that total distributions under the contract will increase commensurately with G's longevity. Thus, the potential fluctuation in the annuity distributions does not cause the contract to fail to be described in section 1275(a)(1)(B)(i).
(8)
Effective dates
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(8) (ii) and (iii) of this section, this paragraph (j) is applicable for interest accruals on or after February 9, 1998 on annuity
contracts held on or after February 9, 1998.
(ii)
Grandfathered contracts.
This paragraph (j) does not apply to an annuity contract that was purchased before April 7, 1995. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(8), if any additional investment in such a contract is made on or after April 7, 1995, and the additional investment is not required to be made under a binding contractual obligation that was entered into before April 7, 1995, then the additional investment is treated as the purchase of a contract after April 7, 1995.
(iii)
Contracts consistent with the provisions of FI-33-94, published at 1995-1 C.B. 920. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
This paragraph (j) does not apply to a contract purchased on or after April 7, 1995, and before February 9, 1998, if all payments under the contract are periodic payments that are made at least annually for the life (or lives) of one or more individuals, do not increase at any time during the term of the contract, and are part of a series of distributions that begins within one year of the date of the initial investment in the contract. An annuity contract that is otherwise described in the preceding sentence does not fail to be described therein merely because it also provides for a payment (or payments) made by reason of the death of one or more individuals.
(k)
Exception under section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii) for annuities issued by an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code
—(1)
Rule.
For purposes of section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii), an annuity contract issued by a foreign insurance company is considered as issued by an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L if the insurance company is subject to tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on the annuity contract.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of paragraph (k)(1) of this section. Each example assumes that the annuity contract is a contract to which section 72 applies and was issued in a transaction where there is no consideration other than cash or another qualifying annuity contract, pursuant to the exercise of an election under an insurance contract by a beneficiary thereof on the death of the insured party, or in a transaction involving a qualified pension or employee benefit plan. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
Company X is an insurance company that is organized, licensed and doing business in Country Y. Company X does not have a U.S. trade or business and is not, under section 842, subject to U.S. income tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on annuity contracts. A, a U.S. taxpayer, purchases an annuity contract from Company X in Country Y. The annuity contract is not excepted from the definition of a debt instrument by section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Company X has a U.S. trade or business. A purchased the annuity from Company X's U.S. trade or business. Under section 842(a), Company X is subject to tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on the annuity contract. Under these facts, the annuity contract is excepted from the definition of a debt instrument by section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that there is a tax treaty between Country Y and the United States. Company X is a resident of Country Y for purposes of the U.S.-Country Y tax treaty. Company X's activities in the U.S. do not constitute a permanent establishment under the U.S.-Country Y tax treaty. Because Company X does not have a U.S. permanent establishment, Company X is not subject to tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on the annuity contract. Thus, the annuity contract is not excepted from the definition of a debt instrument by section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Company X is a foreign insurance corporation controlled by a U.S. shareholder. Company X does not make an election 1 under section 953(d) to be treated as a domestic corporation. The controlling U.S. shareholder is required under sections 953 and 954 to include income earned on the annuity contract in its taxable income under subpart F. However, Company X is not subject to tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on the annuity contract. Thus, the annuity contract is not excepted from the definition of a debt instrument by section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that Company X properly elects under section 953(d) to be treated as a domestic corporation. By reason of its election, Company X is subject to tax under subchapter L with respect to income earned on the annuity contract. Thus, the annuity contract is excepted from the definition of a debt instrument by section 1275(a)(1)(B)(ii).
(3)
Effective date.
This paragraph (k) is applicable for interest accruals on or after June 6, 2002. This paragraph (k) does not apply to an annuity contract that was purchased before January 12, 2001. For purposes of this paragraph (k), if any additional investment in a contract purchased before January 12, 2001, is made on or after January 12, 2001, and the additional investment is not required to be made under a binding written contractual obligation that was entered into before that date, then the additional investment is treated as the purchase of a contract after January 12, 2001.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4825, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8746, 62 FR 68183, Dec. 31, 1997; T.D. 8754, 63 FR 1057, Jan. 8, 1998; T.D. 8934, 66 FR 2815, Jan. 12, 2001; T.D. 8993, 67 FR 30548, May 7, 2002; T.D. 9790, 81 FR 72984, Oct. 21, 2016: T.D. 9880, 84 FR 59302, Nov. 4, 2019]
§ 1.1275-2
Special rules relating to debt instruments.
(a)
Payment ordering rule
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each payment under a debt instrument is treated first as a payment of OID to the extent of the OID that has accrued as of the date the payment is due and has not been allocated to prior payments, and second as a payment of principal. Thus, no portion of any payment is treated as prepaid interest.
(2)
Exceptions.
The rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to—
(i) A payment of qualified stated interest;
(ii) A payment of points deductible under section 461(g)(2), in the case of the issuer;
(iii) A pro rata prepayment described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section; or
(iv) A payment of additional interest or a similar charge provided with respect to amounts that are not paid when due.
(b)
Debt instruments distributed by corporations with respect to stock
—(1)
Treatment of distribution.
For purposes of determining the issue price of a debt instrument distributed by a corporation with respect to its stock, the instrument is treated as issued by the corporation for property. See section 1275(a)(4). Thus, under section 1273(b)(3), the issue price of a distributed debt instrument that is traded on an established market is its fair market value. The issue price of a distributed debt instrument that is not traded on an established market is determined under section 1274 or section 1273(b)(4).
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of a debt instrument distributed by a corporation with respect to its stock is the date of the distribution.
(c)
Aggregation of debt instruments
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, debt instruments issued in connection with the same transaction or related transactions (determined based on all the facts and circumstances) are treated as a single debt instrument for purposes of sections 1271 through 1275 and the regulations thereunder. This rule ordinarily applies only to debt instruments of a single issuer that are issued to a single holder. The Commissioner may, however, aggregate debt instruments that are issued by more than one issuer or that are issued to more than one holder if the debt instruments are issued in an arrangement that is designed to avoid the aggregation rule (e.g., debt instruments issued by or to related parties or debt instruments originally issued to different holders with the understanding that the debt instruments will be transferred to a single holder).
(2)
Exception if separate issue price established.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a debt instrument if—
(i) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial portion of which is traded on an established market within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f); or
(ii) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial portion of which is issued for money (or for property traded on an established market within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f)) to parties who are not related to the issuer or holder and who do not purchase other debt instruments of the same issuer in connection with the same transaction or related transactions.
(3)
Special rule for debt instruments that provide for the issuance of additional debt instruments.
If, under the terms of a debt instrument (the original debt instrument), the holder may receive one or more additional debt instruments of
the issuer, the additional debt instrument or instruments are aggregated with the original debt instrument. Thus, the payments made pursuant to an additional debt instrument are treated as made on the original debt instrument, and the distribution by the issuer of the additional debt instrument is not considered to be a payment made on the original debt instrument. This paragraph (c)(3) applies regardless of whether the right to receive an additional debt instrument is fixed as of the issue date or is contingent upon subsequent events. See § 1.1272-1(c) for the treatment of certain rights to issue additional debt instruments in lieu of cash payments.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

# Example 1. Exception for debt instruments issued separately to other purchasers.
On January 1, 1995, Corporation M issues two series of bonds, Series A and Series B. The two series are sold for cash and have different terms. Although some holders purchase bonds from both series, a substantial portion of the bonds is issued to different holders. H purchases bonds from both series. Under the exception in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Series A and Series B bonds purchased by H are not aggregated.

# Example 2. Tiered REMICs.
Z forms a dual tier real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). In the dual tier structure, Z forms REMIC A to acquire a pool of real estate mortgages and to issue a residual interest and several classes of regular interests. Contemporaneously, Z forms REMIC B to acquire as qualified mortgages all of the regular interests in REMIC A. REMIC B issues several classes of regular interests and a residual interest, and Z sells all of those interests to unrelated parties in a public offering. Under the general rule set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all of the regular interests issued by REMIC A and held by REMIC B are treated as a single debt instrument for purposes of sections 1271 through 1275.
(d)
Special rules for Treasury securities
—(1)
Issue price and issue date.
The issue price of an issue of Treasury securities is the average price of the securities sold. The issue date of an issue of Treasury securities is the first settlement date on which a substantial amount of the securities in the issue is sold. For an issue of Treasury securities sold from November 1, 1998, to March 13, 2001, the issue price of the issue is the price of the securities sold at auction.
(2)
Reopenings of Treasury securities
—(i)
Treatment of additional Treasury securities.
Notwithstanding § 1.1275-1(f), additional Treasury securities issued in a qualified reopening are part of the same issue as the original Treasury securities. As a result, the additional Treasury securities have the same issue price, issue date, and (with respect to holders) the same adjusted issue price as the original Treasury securities. This paragraph (d)(2) applies to qualified reopenings that occur on or after March 25, 1992.
(ii)
Definitions
—(A)
Additional Treasury securities.
Additional Treasury securities are Treasury securities with terms that are in all respects identical to the terms of the original Treasury securities.
(B)
Original Treasury securities.
Original Treasury securities are securities comprising any issue of outstanding Treasury securities.
(C)
Qualified reopening—reopenings on or after March 13, 2001.
For a reopening of Treasury securities that occurs on or after March 13, 2001, a qualified reopening is a reopening that occurs not more than one year after the original Treasury securities were first issued to the public or, under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section, a reopening in which the additional Treasury securities are issued with no more than a de minimis amount of OID. For a reopening of Treasury securities that occurs on or after September 13, 2012, a qualified reopening also is a reopening of Treasury securities that is described in paragraph (k)(3)(v) of this section.
(D)
Qualified reopening—reopenings before March 13, 2001.
For a reopening of Treasury securities that occurs before March 13, 2001, a qualified reopening is a reopening that occurs not more than one year after the original Treasury securities were first issued to the public. However, for a reopening of Treasury securities (other than Treasury Inflation-Indexed Securities) that occurred prior to November 5, 1999, a qualified reopening is a reopening of Treasury securities that satisfied the preceding sentence and that was intended to alleviate an acute, protracted shortage of the original Treasury securities.
(e)
Disclosure of certain information to holders.
Certain provisions of the regulations under section 163(e) and sections 1271 through 1275 provide that the issuer's determination of an item controls the holder's treatment of the item. In such a case, the issuer must provide the relevant information to the holder in a reasonable manner. For example, the issuer may provide the name or title and either the address or telephone number of a representative of the issuer who will make available to holders upon request the information required for holders to comply with these provisions of the regulations.
(f)
Treatment of pro rata prepayments
—(1)
Treatment as retirement of separate debt instrument.
A pro rata prepayment is treated as a payment in retirement of a portion of a debt instrument, which may result in a gain or loss to the holder. Generally, the gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the original debt instrument consists of two instruments, one that is retired and one that remains outstanding. The adjusted issue price, holder's adjusted basis, and accrued but unpaid OID of the original debt instrument, determined immediately before the pro rata prepayment, are allocated between these two instruments based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired by the pro rata prepayment.
(2)
Definition of pro rata prepayment.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a pro rata prepayment is a payment on a debt instrument made prior to maturity that—
(i) Is not made pursuant to the instrument's payment schedule (including a payment schedule determined under § 1.1272-1(c)); and
(ii) Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each payment remaining to be paid on the instrument.
(g)
Anti-abuse rule
—(1)
In general.
If a principal purpose in structuring a debt instrument or engaging in a transaction is to achieve a result that is unreasonable in light of the purposes of section 163(e), sections 1271 through 1275, or any related section of the Code, the Commissioner can apply or depart from the regulations under the applicable sections as necessary or appropriate to achieve a reasonable result. For example, if this paragraph (g) applies to a debt instrument that provides for a contingent payment, the Commissioner can treat the contingency as if it were a separate position. See also § 1.988-2(b)(18) for debt instruments with payments denominated in (or determined by reference to) a currency other than the taxpayer's functional currency.
(2)
Unreasonable result.
Whether a result is unreasonable is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. In making this determination, a significant fact is whether the treatment of the debt instrument is expected to have a substantial effect on the issuer's or a holder's U.S. tax liability. In the case of a contingent payment debt instrument, another significant fact is whether the result is obtainable without the application of § 1.1275-4 and any related provisions (e.g., if the debt instrument and the contingency were entered into separately). A result will not be considered unreasonable, however, in the absence of an expected substantial effect on the present value of a taxpayer's tax liability.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
A issues a current-pay, increasing-rate note that provides for an early call option. Although the option is deemed exercised on the call date under § 1.1272-1(c)(5), the option is not expected to be exercised by A. In addition, a principal purpose of including the option in the terms of the note is to limit the amount of interest income includible by the holder in the period prior to the call date by virtue of the option rules in § 1.1272-1(c)(5). Moreover, the application of the option rules is expected to substantially reduce the present value of the holder's tax liability. Based on these facts, the application of § 1.1272-1(c)(5) produces an unreasonable result. Therefore, under this paragraph (g), the Commissioner can apply the regulations (in whole or in part) to the note without regard to § 1.1272-1(c)(5).

# Example 2.
C, a foreign corporation not subject to U.S. taxation, issues to a U.S. holder a debt instrument that provides for a contingent payment. The debt instrument is issued for cash and is subject to the noncontingent bond method in § 1.1275-4(b). Six months after issuance, C and the holder modify the debt instrument so that there is a deemed reissuance of the instrument under section
1001. The new debt instrument is subject to the rules of § 1.1275-4(c) rather than § 1.1275-4(b). The application of § 1.1275-4(c) is expected to substantially reduce the present value of the holder's tax liability as compared to the application of § 1.1275-4(b). In addition, a principal purpose of the modification is to substantially reduce the present value of the holder's tax liability through the application of § 1.1275-4(c). Based on these facts, the application of § 1.1275-4(c) produces an unreasonable result. Therefore, under this paragraph (g), the Commissioner can apply the noncontingent bond method to the modified debt instrument.

# Example 3.
D issues a convertible debt instrument rather than an economically equivalent investment unit consisting of a debt instrument and a warrant. The convertible debt instrument is issued at par and provides for annual payments of interest. D issues the convertible debt instrument rather than the investment unit so that the debt instrument would not have OID. See § 1.1273-2(j). In general, this is a reasonable result in light of the purposes of the applicable statutes. Therefore, the Commissioner generally will not use the authority under this paragraph (g) to depart from the application of § 1.1273-2(j) in this case.
(4)
Effective date.
This paragraph (g) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(h)
Remote and incidental contingencies
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (h) applies to a debt instrument if one or more payments on the instrument are subject to either a remote or incidental contingency. Whether a contingency is remote or incidental is determined as of the issue date of the debt instrument, including any date there is a deemed reissuance of the debt instrument under paragraph (h)(6) (ii) or (j) of this section or § 1.1272-1(c)(6). Except as otherwise provided, the treatment of the contingency under this paragraph (h) applies for all purposes of sections 163(e) (other than sections 163(e)(5)) and 1271 through 1275 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this paragraph (h), the possibility of impairment of a payment by insolvency, default, or similar circumstances is not a contingency.
(2)
Remote contingencies.
A contingency is remote if there is a remote likelihood either that the contingency will occur or that the contingency will not occur. If there is a remote likelihood that the contingency will occur, it is assumed that the contingency will not occur. If there is a remote likelihood that the contingency will not occur, it is assumed that the contingency will occur.
(3)
Incidental contingencies
—(i)
Contingency relating to amount.
A contingency relating to the amount of a payment is incidental if, under all reasonably expected market conditions, the potential amount of the payment is insignificant relative to the total expected amount of the remaining payments on the debt instrument. If a payment on a debt instrument is subject to an incidental contingency described in this paragraph (h)(3)(i), the payment is ignored until the payment is made. However, see paragraph (h)(6)(i)(B) of this section for the treatment of the debt instrument if a change in circumstances occurs prior to the date the payment is made.
(ii)
Contingency relating to time.
A contingency relating to the timing of a payment is incidental if, under all reasonably expected market conditions, the potential difference in the timing of the payment (from the earliest date to the latest date) is insignificant. If a payment on a debt instrument is subject to an incidental contingency described in this paragraph (h)(3)(ii), the payment is treated as made on the earliest date that the payment could be made pursuant to the contingency. If the payment is not made on this date, a taxpayer makes appropriate adjustments to take into account the delay in payment. However, see paragraph (h)(6)(i)(C) of this section for the treatment of the debt instrument if the delay is not insignificant.
(4)
Aggregation rule.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if a debt instrument provides for multiple contingencies each of which has a remote likelihood of occurring but, when all of the contingencies are considered together, there is a greater than remote likelihood that at least one of the contingencies will occur, none of the contingencies is treated as a remote contingency. For purposes of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, if a debt instrument provides for multiple contingencies each of which is incidental but the potential total amount of all of the payments subject to the contingencies
is not, under reasonably expected market conditions, insignificant relative to the total expected amount of the remaining payments on the debt instrument, none of the contingencies is treated as incidental.
(5)
Consistency rule.
For purposes of paragraphs (h) (2) and (3) of this section, the issuer's determination that a contingency is either remote or incidental is binding on all holders. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly discloses that its determination is different from the issuer's determination. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. See § 1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.
(6)
Subsequent adjustments
—(i) Applicability. This paragraph (h)(6) applies to a debt instrument when there is a change in circumstances. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there is a change in circumstances if—
(A) A remote contingency actually occurs or does not occur, contrary to the assumption made in paragraph (h)(2) of this section;
(B) A payment subject to an incidental contingency described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section becomes fixed in an amount that is not insignificant relative to the total expected amount of the remaining payments on the debt instrument; or
(C) A payment subject to an incidental contingency described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section becomes fixed such that the difference between the assumed payment date and the due date of the payment is not insignificant.
(ii)
In general.
If a change in circumstances occurs, solely for purposes of sections 1272 and 1273, the debt instrument is treated as retired and then reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal to the instrument's adjusted issue price on that date.
(iii)
Contingent payment debt instruments.
Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, in the case of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to § 1.1275-4, if a change in circumstances occurs, no retirement or reissuance is treated as occurring, but any payment that is fixed as a result of the change in circumstances is governed by the rules in § 1.1275-4 that apply when the amount of a contingent payment becomes fixed.
(7)
Effective date.
This paragraph (h) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Treatment of certain modifications.
If the terms of a debt instrument are modified to defer one or more payments, and the modification does not cause an exchange under section 1001, then, solely for purposes of sections 1272 and 1273, the debt instrument is treated as retired and then reissued on the date of the modification for an amount equal to the instrument's adjusted issue price on that date. This paragraph (j) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(k)
Reopenings
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding § 1.1275-1(f), additional debt instruments issued in a qualified reopening are part of the same issue as the original debt instruments. As a result, the additional debt instruments have the same issue date, the same issue price, and (with respect to holders) the same adjusted issue price as the original debt instruments.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Original debt instruments.
Original debt instruments are debt instruments comprising any single issue of outstanding debt instruments. For purposes of determining whether a particular reopening is a qualified reopening, debt instruments issued in prior qualified reopenings are treated as original debt instruments and debt instruments issued in the particular reopening are not so treated.
(ii)
Additional debt instruments.
Additional debt instruments are debt instruments that, without the application of this paragraph (k)—
(A) Are part of a single issue of debt instruments;
(B) Are not part of the same issue as the original debt instruments; and
(C) Have terms that are in all respects identical to the terms of the
original debt instruments as of the reopening date.
(iii)
Reopening date.
The reopening date is the issue date of the additional debt instruments (determined without the application of this paragraph (k)).
(iv)
Announcement date.
The announcement date is the later of seven days before the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established or the date on which the issuer's intent to reopen a security is publicly announced through one or more media, including an announcement reported on the standard electronic news services used by security broker-dealers (for example, Reuters, Telerate, or Bloomberg).
(3)
Qualified reopening
—(i)
Definition.
A qualified reopening is a reopening of original debt instruments that is described in paragraph (k)(3)(ii), (k)(3)(iii), (k)(3)(iv), or (k)(3)(v) of this section. In addition, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine if a reopening of Treasury securities is a qualified reopening.
(ii)
Reopening within six months.
A reopening is described in this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) if—
(A) The original debt instruments are publicly traded (within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f)) as of the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established (or, if earlier, the announcement date);
(B) The reopening date of the additional debt instruments is not more than six months after the issue date of the original debt instruments; and
(C) On the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established (or, if earlier, the announcement date), the yield of the original debt instruments (based on their fair market value) is not more than 110 percent of the yield of the original debt instruments on their issue date (or, if the original debt instruments were issued with no more than a de minimis amount of OID, the coupon rate).
(iii)
Reopening with de minimis OID.
A reopening (including a reopening of Treasury securities) is described in this paragraph (k)(3)(iii) if—
(A) The original debt instruments are publicly traded (within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f)) as of the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established (or, if earlier, the announcement date); and
(B) The additional debt instruments are issued with no more than a de minimis amount of OID (determined without the application of this paragraph (k)).
(iv)
Non-publicly traded debt issued for cash.
A reopening is described in this paragraph (k)(3)(iv) if the additional debt instruments are issued for cash to persons unrelated to the issuer (as determined under section 267(b) or 707(b)) for an arm's length price and either the requirements in paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(B) and (k)(3)(ii)(C) of this section for a reopening within six months are satisfied or the requirements in paragraph (k)(3)(iii)(B) of this section for a reopening with de minimis OID are satisfied. For purposes of paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the yield test is satisfied if, on the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established (or, if earlier, the announcement date), the yield of the additional debt instruments (based on their cash purchase price) is not more than 110 percent of the yield of the original debt instruments on their issue date (or, if the original debt instruments were issued with no more than a de minimis amount of OID, the coupon rate).
(v)
100 Percent yield test for reopening after six months.
A reopening is described in this paragraph (k)(3)(v) if the additional debt instruments are issued more than six months after the issue date of the original debt instruments and either the requirements in paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(A) and (k)(3)(ii)(C) of this section are satisfied or the additional debt instruments are issued for cash to persons unrelated to the issuer (as determined under section 267(b) or 707(b)) for an arm's length price and the requirements in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(C) of this section are satisfied. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the yield test in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(C) of this section is satisfied if, on the date on which the price of the additional debt instruments is established (or, if earlier, the announcement date), the yield of the additional debt instruments (based on their fair market value or cash purchase price, whichever
is applicable) is not more than 100 percent of the yield of the original debt instruments on their issue date (or, if the original debt instruments were issued with no more than a de minimis amount of OID, the coupon rate).
(vi)
Exceptions.
This paragraph (k)(3) does not apply to a reopening of tax-exempt obligations (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) or contingent payment debt instruments (within the meaning of § 1.1275-4).
(4)
Issuer's treatment of a qualified reopening.
See § 1.163-7(e) for the issuer's treatment of the debt instruments that are part of a qualified reopening.
(5)
Effective/applicability dates
—(i) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(5)(ii) of this section, this paragraph (k) applies to debt instruments that are part of a reopening if the reopening date is on or after March 13, 2001.
(ii) Paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(A), (k)(3)(iii)(A), (k)(3)(iv) and (k)(3)(v) of this section apply to debt instruments that are part of a reopening if the reopening date is on or after September 13, 2012.
(l)
OID rule for income item subject to section 451(b)
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other rule in sections 1271 through 1275 and §§ 1.1271-1 through 1.1275-7, if, and to the extent, a taxpayer's item of income with respect to a debt instrument is subject to the timing rules in § 1.451-3 because the item of income is a specified fee described in § 1.451-3(j) (such as credit card late fees, credit card cash advance fees, or interchange fees), then the taxpayer does not take the item into account to determine whether the debt instrument has any OID. As a result, the taxpayer does not treat the item as creating or increasing any OID on the debt instrument.
(2)
Applicability dates
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, for a specified credit card fee as defined in § 1.451-3(j)(2), paragraph (l)(1) of this section applies for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and, for a specified fee that is not a specified credit card fee, paragraph (l)(1) of this section applies for taxable years beginning on or after January 6, 2022.
(ii)
Early application.
For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2018, and before January 1, 2021, a taxpayer and its related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b), may choose to apply both paragraph (l)(1) of this section and the rules in § 1.451-3, in their entirety and in a consistent manner, to all specified credit card fees subject to § 1.451-3, provided that once applied to a taxable year the rules in paragraph (l)(1) of this section and the rules in § 1.451-3 that apply to specified credit card fees, are applied in their entirety and in a consistent manner for all subsequent taxable years. See section 7508(b)(7).
(iii)
Applicability date for accounting method changes.
Paragraph (l)(1) of this section will not apply in applying section 13221(e) of Public Law 115-97, 131 Stat. 2054 (2017), to determine the section 481(a) adjustment period for any adjustment under section 481(a) for a qualified change in method of accounting required under section 451(b) and § 1.451-3 for a specified credit card fee.
(m)
Transition from certain interbank offered rates
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (m) applies to a variable rate debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-5(a)) that provides both for a qualified floating rate that references a discontinued IBOR and for a methodology to change that rate referencing a discontinued IBOR to a different rate in anticipation of the discontinued IBOR becoming unavailable or unreliable. For purposes of this paragraph (m),
discontinued IBOR
has the meaning provided in § 1.1001-6(h)(4). See § 1.1001-6 for additional rules that may apply to a debt instrument that provides for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR.
(2)
Single qualified floating rate.
If a debt instrument is described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the rate referencing a discontinued IBOR and the different rate are treated as a single qualified floating rate for purposes of § 1.1275-5.
(3)
Remote contingency.
If a debt instrument is described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the possibility that the discontinued IBOR will become unavailable or unreliable is treated as a remote contingency for purposes of paragraph (h) of this section.
(4)
Change in circumstances.
If a debt instrument is described in paragraph
(m)(1) of this section, the fact that the discontinued IBOR has become unavailable or unreliable is not treated as a change in circumstances for purposes of paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
(5)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (m) of this section applies to debt instruments issued on or after March 7, 2022. A taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (m) of this section to debt instruments issued before March 7, 2022, provided that the taxpayer and all related parties (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or within the meaning of § 1.150-1(b) for a taxpayer that is a State or local governmental unit (as defined in § 1.103-1(a)) or a 501(c)(3) organization (as defined in section 150(a)(4))) apply paragraph (m) of this section to all debt instruments issued before that date. See section 7805(b)(7).

§ 1.1275-3
OID information reporting requirements.
(a)
In general.
This section provides legending and information reporting requirements intended to facilitate the reporting of OID.
(b)
Information required to be set forth on face of debt instruments that are not publicly offered
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) or paragraph (d) of this section, this paragraph (b) applies to any debt instrument that is not publicly offered (within the meaning of § 1.1275-1(h)), is issued in physical form, and has OID. The issuer of any such debt instrument must legend the instrument by stating on the face of the instrument that the debt instrument was issued with OID. In addition, the issuer must either—
(i) Set forth on the face of the debt instrument the issue price, the amount of OID, the issue date, the yield to maturity, and, in the case of a debt instrument subject to the rules of § 1.1275-4(b), the comparable yield and projected payment schedule; or
(ii) Provide the name or title and either the address or telephone number of a representative of the issuer who will, beginning no later than 10 days after the issue date, promptly make available to holders upon request the information described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Time for legending.
An issuer may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b) by legending the debt instrument when it is first issued in physical form. Legending is not required, however, before the first holder of the debt instrument disposes of the instrument.
(3)
Legend must survive reissuance upon transfer.
Any new physical security that is issued (for example, upon registration of transfer of ownership) must contain any required legend.
(4)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to debt instruments described in section 1272(a)(2) (relating to debt instruments not subject to the periodic OID inclusion rules), debt instruments issued by natural persons (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(2)), REMIC regular interests or other debt instruments subject to section 1272(a)(6), or stripped bonds and coupons within the meaning of section 1286.
(c)
Information required to be reported to Secretary upon issuance of publicly offered debt instruments
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) or paragraph (d) of this section, the information reporting requirements of this paragraph (c) apply to any debt instrument that is publicly offered and has original issue discount. The issuer of any such debt instrument must make an information return on the form prescribed by the Commissioner (Form 8281, as of September 2, 1992). The prescribed form must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the manner specified on the form. The taxpayer must use the prescribed form even if other information returns are filed using other methods (e.g., electronic media), unless the Commissioner announces otherwise in a revenue procedure.
(2)
Time for filing information return.
The prescribed form must be filed for each issue of publicly offered debt instruments within 30 days after the issue date of the issue.
(3)
Exceptions.
The rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to
debt instruments described in section 1272(a)(2), debt instruments issued by natural persons (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(2)), certificates of deposit, REMIC regular interests or other debt instruments subject to section 1272(a)(6), or (unless otherwise required by the Commissioner pursuant to a revenue ruling or revenue procedure) stripped bonds and coupons (within the meaning of section 1286).
(4)
Subsequent registration.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section, the information reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to any debt instrument that has original issue discount if the instrument is part of an issue the offering of which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the issue date of the debt instrument. For example, this paragraph (c)(4) applies to a newly issued debt instrument (B bond) exchanged for an otherwise identical non-SEC-registered debt instrument (A bond) if the B bond is part of an issue the offering of which is registered with the SEC and the B bond has an issue date that is the same as the issue date of the A bond for federal tax purposes because the exchange is not a realization event under § 1.1001-3. If a debt instrument is subject to this paragraph (c)(4), the prescribed form (Form 8281 or any successor) must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the date the offering is registered with the SEC. This paragraph (c)(4) applies to a debt instrument that is part of an issue the offering of which is registered with the SEC on or after January 1, 2014.
(d)
Application to foreign issuers and U.S. issuers of foreign-targeted debt instruments.
A foreign or domestic issuer is subject to the rules of this section with respect to an issue of debt instruments unless the issue is not offered for sale or resale in the United States in connection with its original issuance.
(e)
Penalties.
See section 6706 for rules relating to the penalty imposed for failure to meet the information reporting requirements imposed by this section.
(f)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section are effective for an issue of debt instruments issued after September 2, 1992.

§ 1.1275-4
Contingent payment debt instruments.
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this section applies to any debt instrument that provides for one or more contingent payments. In general, paragraph (b) of this section applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for money or publicly traded property and paragraph (c) of this section applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for nonpublicly traded property. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for tax-exempt obligations. See § 1.1275-6 for a taxpayer's treatment of a contingent payment debt instrument and a hedge.
(2)
Exceptions.
This section does not apply to—
(i) A debt instrument that has an issue price determined under section 1273(b)(4) (e.g., a debt instrument subject to section 483);
(ii) A variable rate debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-5);
(iii) A debt instrument subject to § 1.1272-1(c) (a debt instrument that provides for certain contingencies) or § 1.1272-1(d) (a debt instrument that provides for a fixed yield);
(iv) A debt instrument subject to section 988 (except as provided in § 1.988-6);
(v) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies (certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration);
(vi) A debt instrument (other than a tax-exempt obligation) described in section 1272(a)(2) (e.g., U.S. savings bonds, certain loans between natural persons, and short-term taxable obligations);
(vii) An inflation-indexed debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-7); or
(viii) A debt instrument issued pursuant to a plan or arrangement if—
(A) The plan or arrangement is created by a state statute;
(B) A primary objective of the plan or arrangement is to enable the participants to pay for the costs of post-secondary education for themselves or their designated beneficiaries; and
(C) Contingent payments on the debt instrument are related to such objective.
(3)
Insolvency and default.
A payment is not contingent merely because of the possibility of impairment by insolvency, default, or similar circumstances.
(4)
Convertible debt instruments.
A debt instrument does not provide for contingent payments merely because it provides for an option to convert the debt instrument into the stock of the issuer, into the stock or debt of a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), or into cash or other property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such stock or debt. For debt instruments issued on or after February 5, 2013, the term
stock
in the preceding sentence means an equity interest in any entity that is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as either a partnership or a corporation.
(5)
Remote and incidental contingencies.
A payment is not a contingent payment merely because of a contingency that, as of the issue date, is either remote or incidental. See § 1.1275-2(h) for the treatment of remote and incidental contingencies.
(b)
Noncontingent bond method
—(1)
Applicability.
The noncontingent bond method described in this paragraph (b) applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that has an issue price determined under § 1.1273-2 (e.g., a contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for money or publicly traded property).
(2)
In general.
Under the noncontingent bond method, interest on a debt instrument must be taken into account whether or not the amount of any payment is fixed or determinable in the taxable year. The amount of interest that is taken into account for each accrual period is determined by constructing a projected payment schedule for the debt instrument and applying rules similar to those for accruing OID on a noncontingent debt instrument. If the actual amount of a contingent payment is not equal to the projected amount, appropriate adjustments are made to reflect the difference.
(3)
Description of method.
The following steps describe how to compute the amount of income, deductions, gain, and loss under the noncontingent bond method:
(i)
Step one: Determine the comparable yield.
Determine the comparable yield for the debt instrument under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The comparable yield is determined as of the debt instrument's issue date.
(ii)
Step two: Determine the projected payment schedule.
Determine the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The projected payment schedule is determined as of the issue date and remains fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument (except under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, which applies to a payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is due).
(iii)
Step three: Determine the daily portions of interest.
Determine the daily portions of interest on the debt instrument for a taxable year as follows. The amount of interest that accrues in each accrual period is the product of the comparable yield of the debt instrument (properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period. See paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section to determine the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument. The daily portions of interest are determined by allocating to each day in the accrual period the ratable portion of the interest that accrues in the accrual period. Except as modified by paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the daily portions of interest are includible in income by a holder for each day in the holder's taxable year on which the holder held the debt instrument and are deductible by the issuer for each day during the issuer's taxable year on which the issuer was primarily liable on the debt instrument.
(iv)
Step four: Adjust the amount of income or deductions for differences between projected and actual contingent
payments.
Make appropriate adjustments to the amount of income or deductions attributable to the debt instrument in a taxable year for any differences between projected and actual contingent payments. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section to determine the amount of an adjustment and the treatment of the adjustment.
(4)
Comparable yield and projected payment schedule.
This paragraph (b)(4) provides rules for determining the comparable yield and projected payment schedule for a debt instrument. The comparable yield and projected payment schedule must be supported by contemporaneous documentation showing that both are reasonable, are based on reliable, complete, and accurate data, and are made in good faith.
(i)
Comparable yield
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the comparable yield for a debt instrument is the yield at which the issuer would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with terms and conditions similar to those of the contingent payment debt instrument (the comparable fixed rate debt instrument), including the level of subordination, term, timing of payments, and general market conditions. For example, if a § 1.1275-6 hedge (or the substantial equivalent) is available, the comparable yield is the yield on the synthetic fixed rate debt instrument that would result if the issuer entered into the § 1.1275-6 hedge. If a § 1.1275-6 hedge (or the substantial equivalent) is not available, but similar fixed rate debt instruments of the issuer trade at a price that reflects a spread above a benchmark rate, the comparable yield is the sum of the value of the benchmark rate on the issue date and the spread. In determining the comparable yield, no adjustments are made for the riskiness of the contingencies or the liquidity of the debt instrument. The comparable yield must be a reasonable yield for the issuer and must not be less than the applicable Federal rate (based on the overall maturity of the debt instrument).
(B)
Presumption for certain debt instruments.
This paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) applies to a debt instrument if the instrument provides for one or more contingent payments not based on market information and the instrument is part of an issue that is marketed or sold in substantial part to persons for whom the inclusion of interest under this paragraph (b) is not expected to have a substantial effect on their U.S. tax liability. If this paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) applies to a debt instrument, the instrument's comparable yield is presumed to be the applicable Federal rate (based on the overall maturity of the debt instrument). A taxpayer may overcome this presumption only with clear and convincing evidence that the comparable yield for the debt instrument should be a specific yield (determined using the principles in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section) that is higher than the applicable Federal rate. The presumption may not be overcome with appraisals or other valuations of nonpublicly traded property. Evidence used to overcome the presumption must be specific to the issuer and must not be based on comparable issuers or general market conditions.
(ii)
Projected payment schedule.
The projected payment schedule for a debt instrument includes each noncontingent payment and an amount for each contingent payment determined as follows:
(A)
Market-based payments.
If a contingent payment is based on market information (a market-based payment), the amount of the projected payment is the forward price of the contingent payment. The forward price of a contingent payment is the amount one party would agree, as of the issue date, to pay an unrelated party for the right to the contingent payment on the settlement date (e.g., the date the contingent payment is made). For example, if the right to a contingent payment is substantially similar to an exchange-traded option, the forward price is the spot price of the option (the option premium) compounded at the applicable Federal rate from the issue date to the date the contingent payment is due.
(B)
Other payments.
If a contingent payment is not based on market information (a non-market-based payment), the amount of the projected payment is the expected value of the contingent payment as of the issue date.
(C)
Adjustments to the projected payment schedule.
The projected payment
schedule must produce the comparable yield. If the projected payment schedule does not produce the comparable yield, the schedule must be adjusted consistent with the principles of this paragraph (b)(4) to produce the comparable yield. For example, the adjusted amounts of non-market-based payments must reasonably reflect the relative expected values of the payments and must not be set to accelerate or defer income or deductions. If the debt instrument contains both market-based and non-market-based payments, adjustments are generally made first to the non-market-based payments because more objective information is available for the market-based payments.
(iii)
Market information.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), market information is any information on which an objective rate can be based under § 1.1275-5(c) (1) or (2).
(iv)
Issuer/holder consistency.
The issuer's projected payment schedule is used to determine the holder's interest accruals and adjustments. The issuer must provide the projected payment schedule to the holder in a manner consistent with the issuer disclosure rules of § 1.1275-2(e). If the issuer does not create a projected payment schedule for a debt instrument or the issuer's projected payment schedule is unreasonable, the holder of the debt instrument must determine the comparable yield and projected payment schedule for the debt instrument under the rules of this paragraph (b)(4). A holder that determines its own projected payment schedule must explicitly disclose this fact and the reason why the holder set its own schedule (e.g., why the issuer's projected payment schedule is unreasonable). Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument.
(v)
Issuer's determination respected
—(A)
In general.
If the issuer maintains the contemporaneous documentation required by this paragraph (b)(4), the issuer's determination of the comparable yield and projected payment schedule will be respected unless either is unreasonable.
(B)
Unreasonable determination.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, a comparable yield or projected payment schedule generally will be considered unreasonable if it is set with a purpose to overstate, understate, accelerate, or defer interest accruals on the debt instrument. In a determination of whether a comparable yield or projected payment schedule is unreasonable, consideration will be given to whether the treatment of the debt instrument under this section is expected to have a substantial effect on the issuer's or holder's U.S. tax liability. For example, if a taxable issuer markets a debt instrument to a holder not subject to U.S. taxation, the comparable yield will be given close scrutiny and will not be respected unless contemporaneous documentation shows that the yield is not too high.
(C)
Exception.
Paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to a debt instrument subject to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section (concerning a yield presumption for certain debt instruments that provide for non-market-based payments).
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(4). In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 1. Market-based payment.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, X corporation issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2006. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest, beginning in 1997, at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity equal to $1,000,000 plus the excess, if any, of the price of 10,000 shares of publicly traded stock in an unrelated corporation on the maturity date over $350,000, or less the excess, if any, of $350,000 over the price of 10,000 shares of the stock on the maturity date. On the issue date, the forward price to purchase 10,000 shares of the stock on December 31, 2006, is $350,000.
(ii)
Comparable yield.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the debt instrument's comparable yield is the yield on the synthetic debt instrument that would result if X corporation entered into a § 1.1275-6 hedge. A
§ 1.1275-6 hedge in this case is a forward contract to purchase 10,000 shares of the stock on December 31, 2006. If X corporation entered into this hedge, the resulting synthetic debt instrument would yield 6 percent, compounded annually. Thus, the comparable yield on the debt instrument is 6 percent, compounded annually.
(iii)
Projected payment schedule.
Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of 10 annual payments of $60,000 and a projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. Because the right to the contingent payment is based on market information, the projected amount of the contingent payment is the forward price of the payment. The right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a right to a payment of $1,000,000 combined with a cash-settled forward contract for the purchase of 10,000 shares of the stock for $350,000 on December 31, 2006. Because the forward price to purchase 10,000 shares of the stock on December 31, 2006, is $350,000, the amount to be received or paid under the forward contract is projected to be zero. As a result, the projected amount of the contingent payment at maturity is $1,000,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount and no additional amount to be received or paid under the forward contract.
(A) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the forward price to purchase 10,000 shares of the stock on December 31, 2006, is $370,000. If X corporation entered into a § 1.1275-6 hedge (a forward contract to purchase the shares for $370,000), the resulting synthetic debt instrument would yield 6.15 percent, compounded annually. Thus, the comparable yield on the debt instrument is 6.15 percent, compounded annually. The projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of 10 annual payments of $60,000 and a projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The projected amount of the contingent payment is $1,020,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount plus the excess $20,000 of the forward price of the stock over the purchase price of the stock under the forward contract.
(B) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the forward price to purchase 10,000 shares of the stock on December 31, 2006, is $330,000. If X corporation entered into a § 1.1275-6 hedge, the resulting synthetic debt instrument would yield 5.85 percent, compounded annually. Thus, the comparable yield on the debt instrument is 5.85 percent, compounded annually. The projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of 10 annual payments of $60,000 and a projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The projected amount of the contingent payment is $980,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount minus the excess $20,000 of the purchase price of the stock under the forward contract over the forward price of the stock.

# Example 2. Non-market-based payments.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, Y issues to Z for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000,000, payable at maturity, and provides for payments on December 31 of each year, beginning in 1997, of $20,000 plus 1 percent of Y's gross receipts, if any, for the year. On the issue date, Y has outstanding fixed rate debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years that trade at a price that reflects an average of 100 basis points over Treasury bonds. These debt instruments have terms and conditions similar to those of the debt instrument. Assume that on December 31, 1996, 4-year Treasury bonds have a yield of 6.5 percent, compounded annually, and that no § 1.1275-6 hedge is available for the debt instrument. In addition, assume that the interest inclusions attributable to the debt instrument are expected to have a substantial effect on Z's U.S. tax liability.
(ii)
Comparable yield.
The comparable yield for the debt instrument is equal to the value of the benchmark rate (i.e., the yield on 4-year Treasury bonds) on the issue date plus the spread. Thus, the debt instrument's comparable yield is 7.5 percent, compounded annually.
(iii)
Projected payment schedule.
Y anticipates that it will have no gross receipts in 1997, but that it will have gross receipts in later years, and those gross receipts will grow each year for the next three years. Based on its business projections, Y believes that it is not unreasonable to expect that its gross receipts in 1999 and each year thereafter will grow by between 6 percent and 13 percent over the prior year. Thus, Y must take these expectations into account in establishing a projected payment schedule for the debt instrument that results in a yield of 7.5 percent, compounded annually. Accordingly, Y could reasonably set the following projected payment schedule for the debt instrument:
Date
Noncontingent payment
Contingent payment
12/31/1997
$20,000
$0
12/31/1998
20,000
70,000
12/31/1999
20,000
75,600
12/31/2000
1,020,000
83,850
(5)
Qualified stated interest.
No amounts payable on a debt instrument to which this paragraph (b) applies are qualified stated interest within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c).
(6)
Adjustments.
This paragraph (b)(6) provides rules for the treatment of positive and negative adjustments under the noncontingent bond method.
A taxpayer takes into account only those adjustments that occur during a taxable year while the debt instrument is held by the taxpayer or while the taxpayer is primarily liable on the debt instrument.
(i)
Determination of positive and negative adjustments.
If the amount of a contingent payment is more than the projected amount of the contingent payment, the difference is a positive adjustment on the date of the payment. If the amount of a contingent payment is less than the projected amount of the contingent payment, the difference is a negative adjustment on the date of the payment (or on the scheduled date of the payment if the amount of the payment is zero).
(ii)
Treatment of net positive adjustments.
The amount, if any, by which total positive adjustments on a debt instrument in a taxable year exceed the total negative adjustments on the debt instrument in the taxable year is a net positive adjustment. A net positive adjustment is treated as additional interest for the taxable year.
(iii)
Treatment of net negative adjustments.
The amount, if any, by which total negative adjustments on a debt instrument in a taxable year exceed the total positive adjustments on the debt instrument in the taxable year is a net negative adjustment. A taxpayer's net negative adjustment on a debt instrument for a taxable year is treated as follows:
(A)
Reduction of interest accruals.
A net negative adjustment first reduces interest for the taxable year that the taxpayer would otherwise account for on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Ordinary income or loss.
If the net negative adjustment exceeds the interest for the taxable year that the taxpayer would otherwise account for on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the excess is treated as ordinary loss by a holder and ordinary income by an issuer. However, the amount treated as ordinary loss by a holder is limited to the amount by which the holder's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument exceed the total amount of the holder's net negative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt instrument in prior taxable years. The amount treated as ordinary income by an issuer is limited to the amount by which the issuer's total interest deductions on the debt instrument exceed the total amount of the issuer's net negative adjustments treated as ordinary income on the debt instrument in prior taxable years.
(C)
Carryforward.
If the net negative adjustment exceeds the sum of the amounts treated by the taxpayer as a reduction of interest and as ordinary income or loss (as the case may be) on the debt instrument for the taxable year, the excess is a negative adjustment carryforward for the taxable year. In general, a taxpayer treats a negative adjustment carryforward for a taxable year as a negative adjustment on the debt instrument on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. However, if a holder of a debt instrument has a negative adjustment carryforward on the debt instrument in a taxable year in which the debt instrument is sold, exchanged, or retired, the negative adjustment carryforward reduces the holder's amount realized on the sale, exchange, or retirement. If an issuer of a debt instrument has a negative adjustment carryforward on the debt instrument for a taxable year in which the debt instrument is retired, the issuer takes the negative adjustment carryforward into account as ordinary income.
(D)
Treatment under section 67.
A net negative adjustment is not subject to section 67 (the 2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions).
(iv)
Cross-references.
If a holder has a basis in a debt instrument that is different from the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the holder may have additional positive or negative adjustments under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. If the amount of a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before the date it is due, the amount and timing of the adjustment are determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section.
(7)
Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and retirement
—(i)
In general.
If a debt instrument is subject to the noncontingent bond method, this paragraph (b)(7)
provides rules to determine the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument, the holder's basis in the debt instrument, and the treatment of any scheduled or unscheduled retirements. In general, because any difference between the actual amount of a contingent payment and the projected amount of the payment is taken into account as an adjustment to income or deduction, the projected payments are treated as the actual payments for purposes of making adjustments to issue price and basis and determining the amount of any contingent payment made on a scheduled retirement.
(ii)
Definition of adjusted issue price.
The adjusted issue price of a debt instrument is equal to the debt instrument's issue price, increased by the interest previously accrued on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for special rules that apply when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due.
(iii)
Adjustments to basis.
A holder's basis in a debt instrument is increased by the interest previously accrued by the holder on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument to the holder. See paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section for special rules that apply when basis is different from adjusted issue price and paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for special rules that apply when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due.
(iv)
Scheduled retirements.
For purposes of determining the amount realized by a holder and the repurchase price paid by the issuer on the scheduled retirement of a debt instrument, a holder is treated as receiving, and the issuer is treated as paying, the projected amount of any contingent payment due at maturity. If the amount paid or received is different from the projected amount, see paragraph (b)(6) of this section for the treatment of the difference by the taxpayer. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, the amount realized by a holder on the retirement of a debt instrument is reduced by any negative adjustment carryforward determined in the taxable year of the retirement.
(v)
Unscheduled retirements.
An unscheduled retirement of a debt instrument (or the receipt of a pro-rata prepayment that is treated as a retirement of a portion of a debt instrument under § 1.1275-2(f)) is treated as a repurchase of the debt instrument (or a pro-rata portion of the debt instrument) by the issuer from the holder for the amount paid by the issuer to the holder.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraphs (b) (6) and (7) of this section. In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 1. Treatment of positive and negative adjustments.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, Z, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (b) at original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument's comparable yield is 10 percent, compounded annually, and the projected payment schedule provides for payments of $500 on December 31, 1997 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of $375 and a projected amount of $125) and $660 on December 31, 1998 (consisting of a noncontingent payment of $600 and a projected amount of $60). The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z.
(ii)
Adjustment in 1997.
Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest on the debt instrument are $100 for 1997 (issue price of $1,000 × 10 percent). Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $375, rather than the projected $500. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a negative adjustment of $125 on December 31, 1997, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the
projected payment. Because Z has no positive adjustments for 1997, Z has a net negative adjustment of $125 on the debt instrument for 1997. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $100 total daily portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1997. Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because Z had no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable years, the remaining $25 of the net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that results in a negative adjustment of $25 on January 1, 1998.
(iii)
Adjustment to issue price and basis.
Z's total daily portions of interest on the debt instrument are $100 for 1997. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are increased by this amount, despite the fact that Z does not include this amount in income because of the net negative adjustment for 1997. In addition, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are decreased on December 31, 1997, by the projected amount of the payment on that date ($500). Thus, on January 1, 1998, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument are $600.
(iv)
Adjustments in 1998.
Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest are $60 for 1998 (adjusted issue price of $600 × 10 percent). Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1998, is $700, rather than the projected $660. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $40 on December 31, 1998, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. Because Z also has a negative adjustment of $25 on January 1, 1998, Z has a net positive adjustment of $15 on the debt instrument for 1998 (the excess of the $40 positive adjustment over the $25 negative adjustment). As a result, Z has $75 of interest income on the debt instrument for 1998 (the $15 net positive adjustment plus the $60 total daily portions of interest that are taken into account by Z in that year).
(v)
Retirement.
Based on the projected payment schedule, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately before the payment at maturity is $660 ($600 plus $60 total daily portions of interest for 1998). Even though Z receives $700 at maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt instrument, Z is treated as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 1998. Therefore, Z is treated as receiving $660 on December 31, 1998. Because Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately before its retirement is $660, Z recognizes no gain or loss on the retirement.

# Example 2. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of sale.
(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (b)(7)(vi), except that Z sells the debt instrument on January 1, 1998, for $630.
(ii)
Gain on sale.
On the date the debt instrument is sold, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $600. Because Z has a negative adjustment of $25 on the debt instrument on January 1, 1998, and has no positive adjustments on the debt instrument in 1998, Z has a net negative adjustment for 1998 of $25. Because Z has not included in income any interest on the debt instrument, the entire $25 net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for the taxable year of the sale. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, the $25 negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount realized by Z on the sale of the debt instrument from $630 to $605. Thus, Z has a gain on the sale of $5 ($605−$600). Under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the gain is treated as interest income.

# Example 3. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of retirement.
(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (b)(7)(vi), except that the payment actually made on December 31, 1998, is $615, rather than the projected $660.
(ii)
Adjustments in 1998.
Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a negative adjustment of $45 on December 31, 1998, attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the amount of the projected payment. In addition, Z has a negative adjustment of $25 on January 1, 1998. See
Example 1
(ii) of this paragraph (b)(7)(vi). Because Z has no positive adjustments in 1998, Z has a net negative adjustment of $70 for 1998. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $60 total daily portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income for 1998. Therefore, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1998. Because Z had no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for 1997, the remaining $10 of the net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1998 that reduces the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt instrument.
(iii)
Loss on retirement.
Immediately before the payment at maturity, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $660. Under paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, Z is treated as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment, or $660, as the payment at maturity. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, however, this amount is reduced by any negative adjustment carryforward determined for the taxable year of retirement to calculate the amount Z realizes on retirement of the debt instrument. Thus, Z has a loss of $10 on the retirement of the debt instrument, equal to the amount by which Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument ($660)
exceeds the amount Z realizes on the retirement of the debt instrument ($660 minus the $10 negative adjustment carryforward). Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the loss is a capital loss.
(8)
Character on sale, exchange, or retirement
—(i)
Gain.
Any gain recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (b) is interest income.
(ii)
Loss.
Any loss recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (b) is ordinary loss to the extent that the holder's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument exceed the total net negative adjustments on the debt instrument the holder took into account as ordinary loss. Any additional loss is treated as loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument. However, any loss that would otherwise be ordinary under this paragraph (b)(8)(ii) and that is attributable to the holder's basis that could not be amortized under section 171(b)(4) is loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument.
(iii)
Special rule if there are no remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument
—(A)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(8) (i) and (ii) of this section, if, at the time of the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument, there are no remaining contingent payments due on the debt instrument under the projected payment schedule, any gain or loss recognized by the holder is gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section to determine whether there are no remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument that provides for fixed but deferred contingent payments.
(B)
Exception for certain positive adjustments.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(A) of this section, if a positive adjustment on a debt instrument is spread under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) (F) or (G) of this section, any gain recognized by the holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the instrument is treated as interest income to the extent of the positive adjustment that has not yet been accrued and included in income by the holder.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(8). In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 1. Gain on sale.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1998, D, a calendar year taxpayer, sells a debt instrument that is subject to paragraph (b) of this section for $1,350. The projected payment schedule for the debt instrument provides for contingent payments after January 1, 1998. On January 1, 1998, D has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $1,200. In addition, D has a negative adjustment carryforward of $50 for 1997 that, under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, results in a negative adjustment of $50 on January 1, 1998. D has no positive adjustments on the debt instrument on January 1, 1998.
(ii)
Character of gain.
Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the $50 negative adjustment on January 1, 1998, results in a negative adjustment carryforward for 1998, the taxable year of the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, the negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount realized by D on the sale of the debt instrument from $1,350 to $1,300. As a result, D realizes a $100 gain on the sale of the debt instrument, equal to the $1,300 amount realized minus D's $1,200 adjusted basis in the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the gain is interest income to D.

# Example 2. Loss on sale.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, E, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of E. The debt instrument provides for a single payment on December 31, 1998 (the maturity date of the instrument), of $1,000 plus an amount based on the increase, if any, in the price of a specified commodity over the term of the instrument. The comparable yield for the debt instrument is 9.54 percent, compounded annually, and the projected payment schedule provides for a payment of $1,200 on December 31, 1998. Based on the projected payment schedule, the total daily portions of interest are $95 for 1997 and $105 for 1998.
(ii)
Ordinary loss.
Assume that E sells the debt instrument for $1,050 on December 31, 1997. On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $1,095 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily portions of $95 for 1997). Therefore, E realizes a $45 loss on the sale of the debt instrument ($1,050-$1,095). The loss is ordinary to the extent E's total
interest inclusions on the debt instrument ($95) exceed the total net negative adjustments on the instrument that E took into account as an ordinary loss. Because E has not had any net negative adjustments on the debt instrument, the $45 loss is an ordinary loss.
(iii)
Capital loss.
Alternatively, assume that E sells the debt instrument for $990 on December 31, 1997. E realizes a $105 loss on the sale of the debt instrument ($990 − $1,095). The loss is ordinary to the extent E's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument ($95) exceed the total net negative adjustments on the instrument that E took into account as an ordinary loss. Because E has not had any net negative adjustments on the debt instrument, $95 of the $105 loss is an ordinary loss. The remaining $10 of the $105 loss is a capital loss.
(9)
Operating rules.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(9) apply to a debt instrument subject to the noncontingent bond method notwithstanding any other rule of this paragraph (b).
(i)
Basis different from adjusted issue price.
This paragraph (b)(9)(i) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a debt instrument is different from the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument (e.g., a subsequent holder that purchases the debt instrument for more or less than the instrument's adjusted issue price).
(A)
General rule.
The holder accrues interest under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and makes adjustments under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section based on the projected payment schedule determined as of the issue date of the debt instrument. However, upon acquiring the debt instrument, the holder must reasonably allocate any difference between the adjusted issue price and the basis to daily portions of interest or projected payments over the remaining term of the debt instrument. Allocations are taken into account under paragraphs (b)(9)(i) (B) and (C) of this section.
(B)
Basis greater than adjusted issue price.
If the holder's basis in the debt instrument exceeds the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the amount of the difference allocated to a daily portion of interest or to a projected payment is treated as a negative adjustment on the date the daily portion accrues or the payment is made. On the date of the adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is reduced by the amount the holder treats as a negative adjustment under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B). See paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) of this section for a special rule that applies when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due.
(C)
Basis less than adjusted issue price.
If the holder's basis in the debt instrument is less than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the amount of the difference allocated to a daily portion of interest or to a projected payment is treated as a positive adjustment on the date the daily portion accrues or the payment is made. On the date of the adjustment, the holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is increased by the amount the holder treats as a positive adjustment under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(C). See paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) of this section for a special rule that applies when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before it is due.
(D)
Premium and discount rules do not apply.
The rules for accruing premium and discount in sections 171, 1272(a)(7), 1276, and 1281 do not apply. Other rules of those sections, such as section 171(b)(4), continue to apply to the extent relevant.
(E)
Safe harbor for exchange listed debt instruments.
If the debt instrument is exchange listed property (within the meaning of § 1.1273-2(f)(2) as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2011), it is reasonable for the holder to allocate any difference between the holder's basis and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument pro-rata to daily portions of interest (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) over the remaining term of the debt instrument. A pro-rata allocation is not reasonable, however, to the extent the holder's yield on the debt instrument, determined after taking into account the amounts allocated under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(E), is less than the applicable Federal rate for the instrument. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument is determined as if the purchase date were the issue date and the remaining term of the instrument were the term of the instrument.
(F)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(9)(i). In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. In addition, assume that each instrument is not exchange listed property.

# Example 1. Basis greater than adjusted issue price.
(i)
Facts.
On July 1, 1998, Z purchases for $1,405 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 1999, and promises to pay on the maturity date $1,000 plus the increase, if any, in the price of a specified amount of a commodity from the issue date to the maturity date. The debt instrument was originally issued on December 31, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. The comparable yield for the debt instrument is 10.25 percent, compounded semiannually, and the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument (determined as of the issue date) provides for a single payment at maturity of $1,350. At the time of the purchase, the debt instrument has an adjusted issue price of $1,162, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. The increase in the value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment and not to a decrease in market interest rates. The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of Z. Z is a calendar year taxpayer.
(ii)
Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price.
Z's basis in the debt instrument on July 1, 1998, is $1,405. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section, Z allocates the $243 difference between basis ($1,405) and adjusted issue price ($1,162) to the contingent payment at maturity. Z's allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price is reasonable because the increase in the value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment.
(iii)
Treatment of debt instrument for 1998.
Based on the projected payment schedule, $60 of interest accrues on the debt instrument from July 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998 (the product of the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on July 1, 1998 ($1,162) and the comparable yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (10.25 percent/2)). Z has no net negative or positive adjustments for 1998. Thus, Z includes in income $60 of total daily portions of interest for 1998. On December 31, 1998, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,465 ($1,405 original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1998).
(iv)
Effect of allocation to contingent payment at maturity.
Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1999, is $1,400, rather than the projected $1,350. Thus, under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $50 on December 31, 1999. In addition, under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Z has a negative adjustment of $243 on December 31, 1999, which is attributable to the difference between Z's basis in the debt instrument on July 1, 1998, and the instrument's adjusted issue price on that date. As a result, Z has a net negative adjustment of $193 for 1999. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $128 total daily portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1999. Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1999. Because Z had $60 of interest inclusions for 1998, $60 of the remaining $65 net negative adjustment is treated by Z as an ordinary loss for 1999. The remaining $5 of the net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1999 that reduces the amount realized by Z on the retirement of the debt instrument from $1,350 to $1,345.
(v)
Loss at maturity.
On December 31, 1999, Z's basis in the debt instrument is $1,350 ($1,405 original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1998 and $128 for 1999, minus the negative adjustment of $243). As a result, Z realizes a loss of $5 on the retirement of the debt instrument (the difference between the amount realized on the retirement ($1,345) and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument ($1,350)). Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the $5 loss is treated as loss from the retirement of the debt instrument. Consequently, Z realizes a total loss of $65 on the debt instrument for 1999 (a $60 ordinary loss and a $5 capital loss).

# Example 2. Basis less than adjusted issue price.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1999, Y purchases for $910 a debt instrument that pays 7 percent interest semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and that promises to pay on December 31, 2001, $1,000 plus or minus $10 times the positive or negative difference, if any, between a specified amount and the value of an index on December 31, 2001. However, the payment on December 31, 2001, may not be less than $650. The debt instrument was originally issued on December 31, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. The comparable yield for the debt instrument is 9.80 percent, compounded semiannually, and the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument (determined as of the issue date) provides for semiannual payments of $35 and a contingent payment at maturity of $1,175. On January 1, 1999, the debt instrument has an adjusted issue price of $1,060, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. Y is a calendar year taxpayer.
(ii)
Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price.
Y's basis in the debt
instrument on January 1, 1999, is $910. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this section, Y must allocate the $150 difference between basis ($910) and adjusted issue price ($1,060) to daily portions of interest or to projected payments. These amounts will be positive adjustments taken into account at the time the daily portions accrue or the payments are made.
(A) Assume that, because of a decrease in the relevant index, the expected value of the payment at maturity has declined by about 9 percent. Based on forward prices on January 1, 1999, Y determines that approximately $105 of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price is allocable to the contingent payment. Y allocates the remaining $45 to daily portions of interest on a pro-rata basis (i.e., the amount allocated to an accrual period equals the product of $45 and a fraction, the numerator of which is the total daily portions for the accrual period and the denominator of which is the total daily portions remaining on the debt instrument on January 1, 1999). This allocation is reasonable.
(B) Assume alternatively that, based on yields of comparable debt instruments and its purchase price for the debt instrument, Y determines that an appropriate yield for the debt instrument is 13 percent, compounded semiannually. Based on this determination, Y allocates $55.75 of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price to daily portions of interest as follows: $15.19 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 1999; $18.40 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000; and $22.16 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 2001. Y allocates the remaining $94.25 to the contingent payment at maturity. This allocation is reasonable.
(ii)
Fixed but deferred contingent payments.
This paragraph (b)(9)(ii) provides rules that apply when the amount of a contingent payment becomes fixed before the payment is due. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if a contingent payment becomes fixed within the 6-month period ending on the due date of the payment, the payment is treated as a contingent payment even after the payment is fixed. If a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due, the following rules apply to the debt instrument.
(A)
Determining adjustments.
The amount of the adjustment attributable to the contingent payment is equal to the difference between the present value of the amount that is fixed and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment. The present value of each amount is determined by discounting the amount from the date the payment is due to the date the payment becomes fixed, using a discount rate equal to the comparable yield on the debt instrument. The adjustment is treated as a positive or negative adjustment, as appropriate, on the date the contingent payment becomes fixed. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(G) of this section to determine the timing of the adjustment if all remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument become fixed substantially contemporaneously.
(B)
Payment schedule.
The contingent payment is no longer treated as a contingent payment after the date the amount of the payment becomes fixed. On the date the contingent payment becomes fixed, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument is modified prospectively to reflect the fixed amount of the payment. Therefore, no adjustment is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section when the contingent payment is actually made.
(C)
Accrual period.
Notwithstanding the determination under § 1.1272-1(b)(1)(ii) of accrual periods for the debt instrument, an accrual period ends on the day the contingent payment becomes fixed, and a new accrual period begins on the day after the day the contingent payment becomes fixed.
(D)
Adjustments to basis and adjusted issue price.
The amount of any positive adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section increases the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument. Similarly, the amount of any negative adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section decreases the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument.
(E)
Basis different from adjusted issue price.
If a holder's basis in a debt instrument exceeds the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the amount allocated to a projected payment under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this
section is treated as a negative adjustment on the date the payment becomes fixed. If a holder's basis in a debt instrument is less than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, the amount allocated to a projected payment under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section is treated as a positive adjustment on the date the payment becomes fixed.
(F)
Special rule for certain contingent interest payments.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(F) applies to contingent stated interest payments that are adjusted to compensate for contingencies regarding the reasonableness of the debt instrument's stated rate of interest. For example, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(F) applies to a debt instrument that provides for an increase in the stated rate of interest if the credit quality of the issuer or liquidity of the debt instrument deteriorates. Contingent stated interest payments of this type are recognized over the period to which they relate in a reasonable manner.
(G)
Special rule when all contingent payments become fixed.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section, if all the remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become fixed substantially contemporaneously, any positive or negative adjustments on the instrument are taken into account in a reasonable manner over the period to which they relate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment is treated as a fixed payment if all remaining contingencies with respect to the payment are remote or incidental (within the meaning of § 1.1275-2(h)).
(H)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(9)(ii). In this example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example: Fixed but deferred payments.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, B, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument matures on December 31, 2002, and provides for a payment of $1,000 at maturity. In addition, on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2002, the debt instrument provides for payments equal to the excess of the average daily value of an index for the 6-month period ending on September 30 of the preceding year over a specified amount. The debt instrument's comparable yield is 10 percent, compounded annually, and the instrument's projected payment schedule consists of a payment of $250 on December 31, 1999, and a payment of $1,439 on December 31, 2002. B uses annual accrual periods.
(ii)
Interest accrual for 1997.
Based on the projected payment schedule, B includes a total of $100 of daily portions of interest in income in 1997. B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1997, is $1,100.
(iii)
Interest accrual for 1998
—(A)
Adjustment.
Based on the projected payment schedule, B would include $110 of total daily portions of interest in income in 1998. However, assume that on September 30, 1998, the payment due on December 31, 1999, fixes at $300, rather than the projected $250. Thus, on September 30, 1998, B has an adjustment equal to the difference between the present value of the $300 fixed amount and the present value of the $250 projected amount of the contingent payment. The present values of the two payments are determined by discounting each payment from the date the payment is due (December 31, 1999) to the date the payment becomes fixed (September 30, 1998), using a discount rate equal to 10 percent, compounded annually. The present value of the fixed payment is $266.30 and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment is $221.91. Thus, on September 30, 1998, B has a positive adjustment of $44.39 ($266.30-$221.91).
(B)
Effect of adjustment.
Under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(C) of this section, B's accrual period ends on September 30, 1998. The daily portions of interest on the debt instrument for the period from January 1, 1998 to September 30, 1998 total $81.51. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are thus increased over this period by $125.90 (the sum of the daily portions of interest of $81.51 and the positive adjustment of $44.39 made at the end of the period) to $1,225.90. For purposes of all future accrual periods, including the new accrual period from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998, the debt instrument's projected payment schedule is modified to reflect a fixed payment of $300 on December 31, 1999. Based on the new adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and the new projected payment schedule, the yield on the debt instrument does not change.
(C)
Interest accrual for 1998.
Based on the modified projected payment schedule, $29.56 of interest accrues during the accrual period that ends on December 31, 1998. Because B has no other adjustments during 1998, the $44.39 positive adjustment on September 30,
1998, results in a net positive adjustment for 1998, which is additional interest for that year. Thus, B includes $155.46 ($81.51 + $29.56 + $44.39) of interest in income in 1998. B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1998, is $1,255.46 ($1,225.90 from the end of the prior accrual period plus $29.56 total daily portions for the current accrual period).
(iii)
Timing contingencies.
This paragraph (b)(9)(iii) provides rules for debt instruments that have payments that are contingent as to time.
(A)
Treatment of certain options.
If a taxpayer has an unconditional option to put or call the debt instrument, to exchange the debt instrument for other property, or to extend the maturity date of the debt instrument, the projected payment schedule is determined by using the principles of § 1.1272-1(c)(5).
(B)
Other timing contingencies.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Cross-border transactions
—(A)
Allocation of deductions.
For purposes of § 1.861-8, the holder of a debt instrument shall treat any deduction or loss treated as an ordinary loss under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(B) or (b)(8)(ii) of this section as a deduction that is definitely related to the class of gross income to which income from such debt instrument belongs. Accordingly, if a U.S. person holds a debt instrument issued by a related controlled foreign corporation and, pursuant to section 904(d)(3) and the regulations thereunder, any interest accrued by such U.S. person with respect to such debt instrument would be treated as foreign source general limitation income, any deductions relating to a net negative adjustment will reduce the U.S. person's foreign source general limitation income. The holder shall apply the general rules relating to allocation and apportionment of deductions to any other deduction or loss realized by the holder with respect to the debt instrument.
(B)
Investments in United States real property.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, gain on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument that is a United States real property interest is treated as gain for purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C.
(v)
Coordination with subchapter M and related provisions.
For purposes of sections 852(c)(2) and 4982 and § 1.852-11, any positive adjustment, negative adjustment, income, or loss on a debt instrument that occurs after October 31 of a taxable year is treated in the same manner as foreign currency gain or loss that is attributable to a section 988 transaction.
(vi)
Coordination with section 1092.
A holder treats a negative adjustment and an issuer treats a positive adjustment as a loss with respect to a position in a straddle if the debt instrument is a position in a straddle and the contingency (or any portion of the contingency) to which the adjustment relates would be part of the straddle if entered into as a separate position.
(c)
Method for debt instruments not subject to the noncontingent bond method
—(1)
Applicability.
This paragraph (c) applies to a contingent payment debt instrument (other than a tax-exempt obligation) that has an issue price determined under § 1.1274-2. For example, this paragraph (c) generally applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for nonpublicly traded property.
(2)
Separation into components.
If paragraph (c) of this section applies to a debt instrument (the overall debt instrument), the noncontingent payments are subject to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and the contingent payments are accounted for separately under the rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of noncontingent payments.
The noncontingent payments are treated as a separate debt instrument. The issue price of the separate debt instrument is the issue price of the overall debt instrument, determined under § 1.1274-2(g). No interest payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated interest payments (within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c)) and the de minimis rules of section 1273(a)(3) and § 1.1273-1(d) do not apply to the separate debt instrument.
(4)
Treatment of contingent payments
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the portion of a contingent payment treated as interest under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section is includible in gross income by the holder and deductible from gross income by the issuer in
their respective taxable years in which the payment is made.
(ii)
Characterization of contingent payments as principal and interest
—(A)
General rule.
A contingent payment is treated as a payment of principal in an amount equal to the present value of the payment, determined by discounting the payment at the test rate from the date the payment is made to the issue date. The amount of the payment in excess of the amount treated as principal under the preceding sentence is treated as a payment of interest.
(B)
Test rate.
The test rate used for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is the rate that would be the test rate for the overall debt instrument under § 1.1274-4 if the term of the overall debt instrument began on the issue date of the overall debt instrument and ended on the date the contingent payment is made. However, in the case of a contingent payment that consists of a payment of stated principal accompanied by a payment of stated interest at a rate that exceeds the test rate determined under the preceding sentence, the test rate is the stated interest rate.
(iii)
Certain delayed contingent payments
—(A)
General rule.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, if a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due, the issuer and holder are treated as if the issuer had issued a separate debt instrument on the date the payment becomes fixed, maturing on the date the payment is due. This separate debt instrument is treated as a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies. The stated principal amount of this separate debt instrument is the amount of the payment that becomes fixed. An amount equal to the issue price of this debt instrument is characterized as interest or principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section and accounted for as if this amount had been paid by the issuer to the holder on the date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed. To determine the issue price of the separate debt instrument, the payment is discounted at the test rate from the maturity date of the separate debt instrument to the date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed.
(B)
Test rate.
The test rate used for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section is determined in the same manner as the test rate under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is determined except that the date the contingent payment is due is used rather than the date the contingent payment is made.
(5)
Basis different from adjusted issue price.
This paragraph (c)(5) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a debt instrument is different from the instrument's adjusted issue price (e.g., a subsequent holder). This paragraph (c)(5), however, does not apply if the holder is reporting income under the installment method of section 453.
(i)
Allocation of basis.
The holder must allocate basis to the noncontingent component (i.e., the right to the noncontingent payments) and to any separate debt instruments described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section in an amount up to the total of the adjusted issue price of the noncontingent component and the adjusted issue prices of the separate debt instruments. The holder must allocate the remaining basis, if any, to the contingent component (i.e., the right to the contingent payments).
(ii)
Noncontingent component.
Any difference between the holder's basis in the noncontingent component and the adjusted issue price of the noncontingent component, and any difference between the holder's basis in a separate debt instrument and the adjusted issue price of the separate debt instrument, is taken into account under the rules for market discount, premium, and acquisition premium that apply to a noncontingent debt instrument.
(iii)
Contingent component.
Amounts received by the holder that are treated as principal payments under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section reduce the holder's basis in the contingent component. If the holder's basis in the contingent component is reduced to zero, any additional principal payments on the contingent component are treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the debt instrument. Any basis remaining on the contingent component on the date the final contingent payment is made
increases the holder's adjusted basis in the noncontingent component (or, if there are no remaining noncontingent payments, is treated as loss from the sale or exchange of the debt instrument).
(6)
Treatment of a holder on sale, exchange, or retirement.
This paragraph (c)(6) provides rules for the treatment of a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (c). Under this paragraph (c)(6), the holder must allocate the amount received from the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument first to the noncontingent component and to any separate debt instruments described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section in an amount up to the total of the adjusted issue price of the noncontingent component and the adjusted issue prices of the separate debt instruments. The holder must allocate the remaining amount received, if any, to the contingent component.
(i)
Amount allocated to the noncontingent component.
The amount allocated to the noncontingent component and any separate debt instruments is treated as an amount realized from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the noncontingent component or separate debt instrument.
(ii)
Amount allocated to the contingent component.
The amount allocated to the contingent component is treated as a contingent payment that is made on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement and is characterized as interest and principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c). In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 1. Contingent interest payments.
(i)
Facts.
A owns Blackacre, unencumbered depreciable real estate. On January 1, 1997, A sells Blackacre to B. As consideration for the sale, B makes a downpayment of $1,000,000 and issues to A a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2001. The debt instrument provides for a payment of principal at maturity of $5,000,000 and a contingent payment of interest on December 31 of each year equal to a fixed percentage of the gross rents B receives from Blackacre in that year. Assume that the debt instrument is not issued in a potentially abusive situation. Assume also that on January 1, 1997, the short-term applicable Federal rate is 5 percent, compounded annually, and the mid-term applicable Federal rate is 6 percent, compounded annually.
(ii)
Determination of issue price.
Under § 1.1274-2(g), the issue price of the debt instrument is $3,736,291, which is the present value, as of the issue date, of the $5,000,000 noncontingent payment due at maturity, calculated using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable Federal rate. Under § 1.1012-1(g)(1), B's basis in Blackacre on January 1, 1997, is $4,736,291 ($1,000,000 down payment plus the $3,736,291 issue price of the debt instrument).
(iii)
Noncontingent payment treated as separate debt instrument.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the right to the noncontingent payment of principal at maturity is treated as a separate debt instrument. The issue price of this separate debt instrument is $3,736,291 (the issue price of the overall debt instrument). The separate debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $5,000,000 and, therefore, OID of $1,263,709.
(iv)
Treatment of contingent payments.
Assume that the amount of contingent interest that is fixed and paid on December 31, 1997, is $200,000. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, this payment is treated as consisting of a payment of principal of $190,476, which is the present value of the payment, determined by discounting the payment at the test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, from the date the payment is made to the issue date. The remainder of the $200,000 payment ($9,524) is treated as interest. The additional amount treated as principal gives B additional basis in Blackacre on December 31, 1997. The portion of the payment treated as interest is includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their respective taxable years in which December 31, 1997 occurs. The remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument are accounted for similarly, using a test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 31, 1998, and December 31, 1999, and a test rate of 6 percent, compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 31, 2000, and December 31, 2001.

# Example 2. Fixed but deferred payment.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(7)
Example 1
of this section, except that the contingent payment of interest that is fixed on December 31, 1997, is not payable until December 31, 2001, the maturity date.
(ii)
Treatment of deferred contingent payment.
Assume that the amount of the payment that becomes fixed on December 31, 1997, is $200,000. Because this amount is not
payable until December 31, 2001, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, a separate debt instrument to which section 1274 applies is treated as issued by B on December 31, 1997 (the date the payment is fixed). The maturity date of this separate debt instrument is December 31, 2001 (the date on which the payment is due). The stated principal amount of this separate debt instrument is $200,000, the amount of the payment that becomes fixed. The imputed principal amount of the separate debt instrument is $158,419, which is the present value, as of December 31, 1997, of the $200,000 payment, computed using a discount rate equal to the test rate of the overall debt instrument (6 percent, compounded annually). An amount equal to the issue price of the separate debt instrument is treated as an amount paid on December 31, 1997, and characterized as interest and principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The amount of the deemed payment characterized as principal is equal to $150,875, which is the present value, as of January 1, 1997 (the issue date of the overall debt instrument), of the deemed payment, computed using a discount rate of 5 percent, compounded annually. The amount of the deemed payment characterized as interest is $7,544 ($158,419 −$150,875), which is includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their respective taxable years in which December 31, 1997 occurs.
(d)
Rules for tax-exempt obligations
—(1)
In general.
Except as modified by this paragraph (d), the noncontingent bond method described in paragraph (b) of this section applies to a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) to which this section applies. Paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies to certain tax-exempt obligations that provide for interest-based payments or revenue-based payments and paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to all other obligations. Paragraph (d)(4) of this section provides rules for a holder whose basis in a tax-exempt obligation is different from the adjusted issue price of the obligation.
(2)
Certain tax-exempt obligations with interest-based or revenue-based payments
—(i)
Applicability.
This paragraph (d)(2) applies to a tax-exempt obligation that provides for interest-based payments or revenue-based payments.
(ii)
Interest-based payments.
A tax-exempt obligation provides for interest-based payments if the obligation would otherwise qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under § 1.1275-5 except that—
(A) The obligation provides for more than one fixed rate;
(B) The obligation provides for one or more caps, floors, or governors (or similar restrictions) that are fixed as of the issue date;
(C) The interest on the obligation is not compounded or paid at least annually; or
(D) The obligation provides for interest at one or more rates equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple greater than zero and less than .65, or at one or more rates equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple greater than zero and less than .65, increased or decreased by a fixed rate.
(iii)
Revenue-based payments.
A tax-exempt obligation provides for revenue-based payments if the obligation—
(A) Is issued to refinance (including a series of refinancings) an obligation (in a series of refinancings, the original obligation), the proceeds of which were used to finance a project or enterprise; and
(B) Would otherwise qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under § 1.1275-5 except that it provides for stated interest payments at least annually based on a single fixed percentage of the revenue, value, change in value, or other similar measure of the performance of the refinanced project or enterprise.
(iv)
Modifications to the noncontingent bond method.
If a tax-exempt obligation is subject to this paragraph (d)(2), the following modifications to the noncontingent bond method described in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the obligation.
(A)
Daily portions and net positive adjustments.
The daily portions of interest determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and any net positive adjustment on the obligation are interest for purposes of section 103.
(B)
Net negative adjustments.
A net negative adjustment for a taxable year reduces the amount of tax-exempt interest the holder would otherwise account for on the obligation for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. If the net negative adjustment exceeds this amount, the excess is a nondeductible, noncapitalizable
loss. If a regulated investment company (RIC) within the meaning of section 851 has a net negative adjustment in a taxable year that would be a nondeductible, noncapitalizable loss under the prior sentence, the RIC must use this loss to reduce its tax-exempt interest income on other tax-exempt obligations held during the taxable year.
(C)
Gains.
Any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the obligation is gain from the sale or exchange of the obligation.
(D)
Losses.
Any loss recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the obligation is treated the same as a net negative adjustment under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
(E)
Special rule for losses and net negative adjustments.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(2)(iv) (B) and (D) of this section, on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the obligation, the holder may claim a loss from the sale or exchange of the obligation to the extent the holder has not received in cash or property the sum of its original investment in the obligation and any amounts included in income under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(3)
All other tax-exempt obligations
—(i)
Applicability.
This paragraph (d)(3) applies to a tax-exempt obligation that is not subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Modifications to the noncontingent bond method.
If a tax-exempt obligation is subject to this paragraph (d)(3), the following modifications to the noncontingent bond method described in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the obligation.
(A)
Modification to projected payment schedule.
The comparable yield for the obligation is the greater of the obligation's yield, determined without regard to the contingent payments, and the tax-exempt applicable Federal rate that applies to the obligation. The Internal Revenue Service publishes the tax-exempt applicable Federal rate for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(B)
Daily portions.
The daily portions of interest determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section are interest for purposes of section 103.
(C)
Adjustments.
A net positive adjustment on the obligation is treated as gain to the holder from the sale or exchange of the obligation in the taxable year of the adjustment. A net negative adjustment on the obligation is treated as a loss to the holder from the sale or exchange of the obligation in the taxable year of the adjustment.
(D)
Gains and losses.
Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the obligation is gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the obligation.
(4)
Basis different from adjusted issue price.
This paragraph (d)(4) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a tax-exempt obligation is different from the adjusted issue price of the obligation. The rules of paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section do not apply to tax-exempt obligations.
(i)
Basis greater than adjusted issue price.
If the holder's basis in the obligation exceeds the obligation's adjusted issue price, the holder, upon acquiring the obligation, must allocate this difference to daily portions of interest on a yield to maturity basis over the remaining term of the obligation. The amount allocated to a daily portion of interest is not deductible by the holder. However, the holder's basis in the obligation is reduced by the amount allocated to a daily portion of interest on the date the daily portion accrues.
(ii)
Basis less than adjusted issue price.
If the holder's basis in the obligation is less than the obligation's adjusted issue price, the holder, upon acquiring the obligation, must allocate this difference to daily portions of interest on a yield to maturity basis over the remaining term of the obligation. The amount allocated to a daily portion of interest is includible in income by the holder as ordinary income on the date the daily portion accrues. The holder's adjusted basis in the obligation is increased by the amount includible in income by the holder under this paragraph (d)(4)(ii) on the date the daily portion accrues.
(iii)
Premium and discount rules do not apply.
The rules for accruing premium and discount in sections 171, 1276, and 1288 do not apply. Other rules of those sections continue to apply to the extent relevant.
(e)
Amounts treated as interest under this section.
Amounts treated as interest under this section are treated as OID for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
(f)
Effective date.
This section applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
[T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30143, June 14, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8709, 62 FR 618, Jan. 6, 1997; T.D. 8838, 64 FR 48547, Sept. 7, 1999; T.D. 9157, 69 FR 52829, Aug. 30, 2004; T.D. 9599, 77 FR 56538, Sept. 13, 2012; T.D. 9612, 78 FR 8016, Feb. 5, 2013]
§ 1.1275-5
Variable rate debt instruments.
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for variable rate debt instruments. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, a variable rate debt instrument is a debt instrument that meets the conditions described in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section. If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument. See § 1.1275-4 for the treatment of a contingent payment debt instrument. See § 1.1275-6 for a taxpayer's treatment of a variable rate debt instrument and a hedge.
(2)
Principal payments.
The issue price of the debt instrument must not exceed the total noncontingent principal payments by more than an amount equal to the lesser of—
(i) .015 multiplied by the product of the total noncontingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date (or, in the case of an installment obligation, the weighted average maturity as defined in § 1.1273-1(e)(3)); or
(ii) 15 percent of the total noncontingent principal payments.
(3)
Stated interest
—(i)
General rule.
The debt instrument must not provide for any stated interest other than stated interest (compounded or paid at least annually) at—
(A) One or more qualified floating rates;
(B) A single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates;
(C) A single objective rate; or
(D) A single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a qualified inverse floating rate.
(ii)
Certain debt instruments bearing interest at a fixed rate for an initial period.
If interest on a debt instrument is stated at a fixed rate for an initial period of 1 year or less followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period, and the value of the variable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate the fixed rate, the fixed rate and the variable rate together constitute a single qualified floating rate or objective rate. A fixed rate and a variable rate will be conclusively presumed to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence if the value of the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the value of the fixed rate by more than .25 percentage points (25 basis points).
(4)
Current value.
The debt instrument must provide that a qualified floating rate or objective rate in effect at any time during the term of the instrument is set at a current value of that rate. A current value is the value of the rate on any day that is no earlier than 3 months prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later than 1 year following that first day.
(5)
No contingent principal payments.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the debt instrument must not provide for any principal payments that are contingent (within the meaning of § 1.1275-4(a)).
(6)
Special rule for debt instruments issued for nonpublicly traded property.
A debt instrument (other than a tax-exempt obligation) that would otherwise qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under this section is not a variable rate debt instrument if section 1274 applies to the instrument and any stated interest payments on the instrument are treated as contingent payments under § 1.1274-2. This paragraph (a)(6) applies to debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996.
(b)
Qualified floating rate
—(1)
In general.
A variable rate is a qualified floating rate if variations in the value of the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in
the currency in which the debt instrument is denominated. The rate may measure contemporaneous variations in borrowing costs for the issuer of the debt instrument or for issuers in general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a multiple of a qualified floating rate is not a qualified floating rate. If a debt instrument provides for two or more qualified floating rates that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the term of the instrument, the qualified floating rates together constitute a single qualified floating rate. Two or more qualified floating rates will be conclusively presumed to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence if the values of all rates on the issue date are within .25 percentage points (25 basis points) of each other.
(2)
Certain rates based on a qualified floating rate.
For a debt instrument issued on or after August 13, 1996, a variable rate is a qualified floating rate if it is equal to either—
(i) The product of a qualified floating rate described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a fixed multiple that is greater than .65 but not more than 1.35; or
(ii) The product of a qualified floating rate described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a fixed multiple that is greater than .65 but not more than 1.35, increased or decreased by a fixed rate.
(3)
Restrictions on the stated rate of interest.
A variable rate is not a qualified floating rate if it is subject to a restriction or restrictions on the maximum stated interest rate (cap), a restriction or restrictions on the minimum stated interest rate (floor), a restriction or restrictions on the amount of increase or decrease in the stated interest rate (governor), or other similar restrictions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following restrictions will not cause a variable rate to fail to be a qualified floating rate—
(i) A cap, floor, or governor that is fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument;
(ii) A cap or similar restriction that is not reasonably expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the debt instrument to be significantly less than the expected yield determined without the cap;
(iii) A floor or similar restriction that is not reasonably expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the debt instrument to be significantly more than the expected yield determined without the floor; or
(iv) A governor or similar restriction that is not reasonably expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the debt instrument to be significantly more or significantly less than the expected yield determined without the governor.
(c)
Objective rate
—(1)
Definition
—(i)
In general.
For debt instruments issued on or after August 13, 1996, an objective rate is a rate (other than a qualified floating rate) that is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information. For example, an objective rate generally includes a rate that is based on one or more qualified floating rates or on the yield of actively traded personal property (within the meaning of section 1092(d)(1)).
(ii)
Exception.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an objective rate does not include a rate based on information that is within the control of the issuer (or a related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) or that is unique to the circumstances of the issuer (or a related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), such as dividends, profits, or the value of the issuer's stock. However, a rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely because it is based on the credit quality of the issuer.
(2)
Other objective rates to be specified by Commissioner.
The Commissioner may designate in the Internal Revenue Bulletin variable rates other than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that will be treated as objective rates (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(3)
Qualified inverse floating rate.
An objective rate described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a qualified inverse floating rate if—
(i) The rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate; and
(ii) The variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate (disregarding any restrictions on the rate that are described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), (b)(3)(iii), and (b)(3)(iv) of this section).
(4)
Significant front-loading or back-loading of interest.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a variable rate of interest on a debt instrument is not an objective rate if it is reasonably expected that the average value of the rate during the first half of the instrument's term will be either significantly less than or significantly greater than the average value of the rate during the final half of the instrument's term.
(5)
Tax-exempt obligations.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in the case of a tax-exempt obligation (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(3)), a variable rate is an objective rate only if it is a qualified inverse floating rate or a qualified inflation rate. A rate is a qualified inflation rate if the rate measures contemporaneous changes in inflation based on a general inflation index.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume that the debt instrument is not a tax-exempt obligation. In addition, unless otherwise provided, assume that the rate is not reasonably expected to result in a significant front-loading or back-loading of interest and that the rate is not based on objective financial or economic information that is within the control of the issuer (or a related party) or that is unique to the circumstances of the issuer (or a related party).

# Example 1. Rate based on LIBOR.
X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to the value of the 1-year London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at the end of each year. Variations in the value of 1-year LIBOR over the term of the debt instrument can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds over that term. Accordingly, the rate is a qualified floating rate.

# Example 2. Rate increased by a fixed amount.
X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to 200 basis points (2 percent) plus the current value, at the end of each year, of the average yield on 1-year Treasury securities as published in Federal Reserve bulletins. Variations in the value of this interest rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is a qualified floating rate.

# Example 3. Rate based on commercial paper rate.
X issues a debt instrument that provides for a rate of interest that is periodically adjusted to equal the current interest rate of Bank's commercial paper. Variations in the value of this interest rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is a qualified floating rate.

# Example 4. Rate based on changes in the value of a commodity index.
On January 1, 1997, X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the value of an index for the year immediately preceding the payment. The index is based on the prices of several actively traded commodities. Variations in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. However, because the rate is based on objective financial information using a single fixed formula, the rate is an objective rate.

# Example 5. Rate based on a percentage of S

# P 500 Index.
On January 1, 1997, X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at the end of each year based on a fixed percentage of the value of the S
P 500 Index. Variations in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds and, therefore, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. Although the rate is described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the rate is not an objective rate because, based on historical data, it is reasonably expected that the average value of the rate during the first half of the instrument's term will be significantly less than the average value of the rate during the final half of the instrument's term.

# Example 6. Rate based on issuer's profits.
On January 1, 1997, Z issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments equal to 1 percent of Z's gross profits earned during the year immediately preceding the payment. Variations in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. In addition, because the rate is based on information that is unique to the issuer's circumstances, the rate is not an objective rate.

# Example 7. Rate based on a multiple of an interest index.
On January 1, 1997, Z issues a debt instrument with annual interest payments at a rate equal to two times the value of 1-year LIBOR as of the payment date. Because the rate is a multiple greater than 1.35 times a qualified floating rate, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. However, because the rate is based on objective financial information using a single fixed formula, the rate is an objective rate.

# Example 8. Variable rate based on the cost of borrowed funds in a foreign currency.
On January 1, 1997, Y issues a 5-year dollar denominated debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at a rate equal to the value of 1-year French franc LIBOR as of the payment date. Variations in the value of French franc LIBOR do not measure contemporaneous changes in the cost of newly borrowed funds in dollars. As a result, the rate is not a qualified floating rate for an instrument denominated in dollars. However, because the rate is based on objective financial information using a single fixed formula, the rate is an objective rate.

# Example 9. Qualified inverse floating rate.
On January 1, 1997, X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal to 12 percent minus the value of 1-year LIBOR as of the payment date. On the issue date, the value of 1-year LIBOR is 6 percent. Because the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in 1-year LIBOR, it is a qualified inverse floating rate. However, if the value of 1-year LIBOR on the issue date were 11 percent rather than 6 percent, the rate would not be a qualified inverse floating rate because the rate could not reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in 1-year LIBOR.

# Example 10. Rate based on an inflation index.
On January 1, 1997, X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal to 400 basis points (4 percent) plus the annual percentage change in a general inflation index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index, U.S. City Average, All Items, for all Urban Consumers, seasonally unadjusted). The rate, however, may not be less than zero. Variations in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. However, because the rate is based on objective economic information using a single fixed formula, the rate is an objective rate.
(e)
Qualified stated interest and OID with respect to a variable rate debt instrument
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) provides rules to determine the amount and accrual of OID and qualified stated interest on a variable rate debt instrument. In general, the rules convert the debt instrument into a fixed rate debt instrument and then apply the general OID rules to the debt instrument. The issue price of a variable rate debt instrument, however, is not determined under this paragraph (e). See §§ 1.1273-2 and 1.1274-2 to determine the issue price of a variable rate debt instrument.
(2)
Variable rate debt instrument that provides for annual payments of interest at a single variable rate.
If a variable rate debt instrument provides for stated interest at a single qualified floating rate or objective rate and the interest is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or will be constructively received under section 451, at least annually, the following rules apply to the instrument:
(i) All stated interest with respect to the debt instrument is qualified stated interest.
(ii) The amount of qualified stated interest and the amount of OID, if any, that accrues during an accrual period is determined under the rules applicable to fixed rate debt instruments by assuming that the variable rate is a fixed rate equal to—
(A) In the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate, the value, as of the issue date, of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate; or
(B) In the case of an objective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate), a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the debt instrument.
(iii) The qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period is increased (or decreased) if the interest actually paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the interest assumed to be paid during the accrual period under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
All other variable rate debt instruments except for those that provide for a fixed rate.
If a variable rate debt instrument is not described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and does not provide for interest payable at a fixed rate (other than an initial fixed rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this
section), the amount of interest and OID accruals for the instrument are determined under this paragraph (e)(3).
(i)
Step one: Determine the fixed rate substitute for each variable rate provided under the debt instrument
—(A)
Qualified floating rate.
The fixed rate substitute for each qualified floating rate provided for in the debt instrument is the value of each rate as of the issue date. If, however, a variable rate debt instrument provides for two or more qualified floating rates with different intervals between interest adjustment dates, the fixed rate substitutes for the rates must be based on intervals that are equal in length. For example, if a 4-year debt instrument provides for 24 monthly interest payments based on the value of the 30-day commercial paper rate on each payment date followed by 8 quarterly interest payments based on the value of quarterly LIBOR on each payment date, the fixed rate substitutes may be based on the values, as of the issue date, of the 90-day commercial paper rate and quarterly LIBOR. Alternatively, the fixed rate substitutes may be based on the values, as of the issue date, of the 30-day commercial paper rate and monthly LIBOR.
(B)
Qualified inverse floating rate.
The fixed rate substitute for a qualified inverse floating rate is the value of the qualified inverse floating rate as of the issue date.
(C)
Objective rate.
The fixed rate substitute for an objective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate) is a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the debt instrument.
(ii)
Step two: Construct the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has terms that are identical to those provided under the variable rate debt instrument, except that the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for the fixed rate substitutes (determined in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section) in lieu of the qualified floating rates or objective rate provided under the variable rate debt instrument.
(iii)
Step three: Determine the amount of qualified stated interest and OID with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
The amount of qualified stated interest and OID, if any, are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument under the rules applicable to fixed rate debt instruments and are taken into account as if the holder held the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
(iv)
Step four: Make appropriate adjustments for actual variable rates.
Qualified stated interest or OID allocable to an accrual period must be increased (or decreased) if the interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the interest assumed to be accrued or paid during the accrual period under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. This increase or decrease is an adjustment to qualified stated interest for the accrual period if the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument (as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) provides for qualified stated interest and the increase or decrease is reflected in the amount actually paid during the accrual period. Otherwise, this increase or decrease is an adjustment to OID for the accrual period.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section:

# Example 1. Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
(i)
Facts.
X purchases at original issue a 6-year variable rate debt instrument that provides for semiannual payments of interest. For the first 3 years, the rate of interest is the value of 6-month LIBOR on the payment date. For the final 3 years, the rate is the value of the 6-month T-bill rate on the payment date. On the issue date, the value of 6-month LIBOR is 3 percent, compounded semiannually, and the 6-month T-bill rate is 2 percent, compounded semiannually.
(ii)
Determination of equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the fixed rate substitute for 6-month LIBOR is 3 percent, compounded semiannually, and the fixed rate substitute for the 6-month T-bill rate is 2 percent, compounded semiannually. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that provides for semiannual payments of interest at 3 percent, compounded semiannually, for the first 3 years followed by 2 percent, compounded semiannually, for the final 3 years.

# Example 2. Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument with de minimis OID.
(i)
Facts.
Y purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a 4-year variable rate debt instrument that has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable
at maturity. The debt instrument provides for monthly payments of interest at the end of each month. For the first year, the interest rate is the monthly commercial paper rate and for the last 3 years, the interest rate is the monthly commercial paper rate plus 100 basis points. On the issue date, the monthly commercial paper rate is 3 percent, compounded monthly.
(ii)
Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the variable rate debt instrument is a 4-year debt instrument that has an issue price and stated principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for monthly payments of interest at 3 percent, compounded monthly, for the first year ($250 per month) and monthly payments of interest at 4 percent, compounded monthly, for the last 3 years ($333.33 per month).
(iii)
De minimis OID.
Under § 1.1273-1(a), because a portion (100 basis points) of each interest payment in the final 3 years is not a qualified stated interest payment, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of $2,999.88 ($102,999.88 −$100,000). However, under § 1.1273-1(d)(4) (the de minimis rule relating to teaser rates and interest holidays), the stated redemption price at maturity of the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is $100,999.96 ($100,000 (issue price) plus $999.96 (the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($999.96) and the amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price ($0)). Thus, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is treated as having OID of $999.96 ($100,999.96 −$100,000). Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of $1,010 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,999.96 multiplied by 4 complete years to maturity), the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has de minimis OID. Therefore, the variable rate debt instrument has zero OID and all stated interest payments are qualified stated interest payments.

# Example 3. Adjustment to qualified stated interest for actual payment of interest.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, Z purchases at original issue, for $90,000, a variable rate debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1997, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The amount of interest payable is the value of annual LIBOR on the payment date. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1997, is 7 percent, compounded annually.
(ii)
Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest.
Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as a 2-year debt instrument that has an issue price of $90,000, a stated principal amount of $100,000, and interest payments of $5,000 at the end of each year. The debt instrument has $10,000 of OID and the annual interest payments of $5,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under § 1.1272-1, the debt instrument has a yield of 10.82 percent, compounded annually. The amount of OID allocable to the first annual accrual period (assuming Z uses annual accrual periods) is $4,743.25 (($90,000 × .1082)− $5,000), and the amount of OID allocable to the second annual accrual period is $5,256.75 ($100,000−$94,743.25). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the $2,000 difference between the $7,000 interest payment actually made at maturity and the $5,000 interest payment assumed to be made at maturity under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is treated as additional qualified stated interest for the period.
(4)
Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a single fixed rate
—(i)
General rule.
If a variable rate debt instrument provides for stated interest either at one or more qualified floating rates or at a qualified inverse floating rate and in addition provides for stated interest at a single fixed rate (other than an initial fixed rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section), the amount of interest and OID are determined using the method of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, as modified by this paragraph (e)(4). For purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as if it provided for a qualified floating rate (or a qualified inverse floating rate, if the debt instrument provides for a qualified inverse floating rate), rather than the fixed rate. The qualified floating rate (or qualified inverse floating rate) replacing the fixed rate must be such that the fair market value of the variable rate debt instrument as of the issue date would be approximately the same as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for the qualified floating rate (or qualified inverse floating rate) rather than the fixed rate.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.

# Example: Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a single fixed rate.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1995, X purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a variable rate debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2001, and
that has a stated principal amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for payments of interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. For the first 4 years, the interest rate is 4 percent, compounded annually, and for the last 2 years the interest rate is the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, plus 200 basis points. On January 1, 1995, the value of 1-year LIBOR is 2 percent, compounded annually. In addition, assume that on January 1, 1995, the variable rate debt instrument has approximately the same fair market value as an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years.
(ii)
Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.
Under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as if it provided for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the variable rate debt instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that has an issue price and stated principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for interest payments of $2,000 for the first 4 years and $4,000 for the last 2 years.
(iii)
Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest.
Under § 1.1273-1, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of $4,000 because a portion (200 basis points) of each interest payment in the last 2 years is not a qualified stated interest payment. The $4,000 of OID is allocable over the 6-year term of the debt instrument under § 1.1272-1. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, the difference between the $4,000 payment made in the first 4 years and the $2,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in those years is an adjustment to qualified stated interest. In addition, any difference between the amount actually paid in each of the last 2 years and the $4,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is an adjustment to qualified stated interest.
(f)
Special rule for certain reset bonds.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph (f) provides a special rule for a variable rate debt instrument that provides for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial interval, and provides that on the date immediately following the end of the initial interval (the effective date) the stated interest rate will be a rate determined under a procedure (such as an auction procedure) so that the fair market value of the instrument on the effective date will be a fixed amount (the reset value). Solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, the variable rate debt instrument is treated as—
(1) Maturing on the date immediately preceding the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value; and
(2) Reissued on the effective date for an amount equal to the reset value.
[T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4827, Feb. 2, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30153, June 14, 1996]
§ 1.1275-6
Integration of qualifying debt instruments.
(a)
In general.
This section generally provides for the integration of a qualifying debt instrument with a hedge or combination of hedges if the combined cash flows of the components are substantially equivalent to the cash flows on a fixed or variable rate debt instrument. The integrated transaction is generally subject to the rules of this section rather than the rules to which each component of the transaction would be subject on a separate basis. The purpose of this section is to permit a more appropriate determination of the character and timing of income, deductions, gains, or losses than would be permitted by separate treatment of the components. The rules of this section affect only the taxpayer who holds (or issues) the qualifying debt instrument and enters into the hedge.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Qualifying debt instrument.
A qualifying debt instrument is any debt instrument (including an integrated transaction as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) other than—
(i) A tax-exempt obligation as defined in section 1275(a)(3);
(ii) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies (certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration); or
(iii) A debt instrument that is subject to § 1.483-4 or § 1.1275-4(c) (certain contingent payment debt instruments issued for nonpublicly traded property).
(2)
Section 1.1275-6 hedge
—(i)
In general.
A § 1.1275-6 hedge is any financial instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) if the combined cash flows of the financial instrument
and the qualifying debt instrument permit the calculation of a yield to maturity (under the principles of section 1272), or the right to the combined cash flows would qualify under § 1.1275-5 as a variable rate debt instrument that pays interest at a qualified floating rate or rates (except for the requirement that the interest payments be stated as interest). A financial instrument is not a § 1.1275-6 hedge, however, if the resulting synthetic debt instrument does not have the same term as the remaining term of the qualifying debt instrument. A financial instrument that hedges currency risk is not a § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(ii)
Limitations
—(A) A debt instrument issued by a taxpayer and a debt instrument held by the taxpayer cannot be part of the same integrated transaction.
(B) A debt instrument can be a § 1.1275-6 hedge only if it is issued substantially contemporaneously with, and has the same maturity (including rights to accelerate or delay payments) as, the qualifying debt instrument.
(3)
Financial instrument.
For purposes of this section, a financial instrument is a spot, forward, or futures contract, an option, a notional principal contract, a debt instrument, or a similar instrument, or combination or series of financial instruments. Stock is not a financial instrument for purposes of this section.
(4)
Synthetic debt instrument.
The synthetic debt instrument is the hypothetical debt instrument with the same cash flows as the combined cash flows of the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(c)
Integrated transaction
—(1)
Integration by taxpayer.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a qualifying debt instrument and a § 1.1275-6 hedge are an integrated transaction if all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(i) The taxpayer satisfies the identification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section on or before the date the taxpayer enters into the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(ii) None of the parties to the § 1.1275-6 hedge are related within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), or, if the parties are related, the party providing the hedge uses, for Federal income tax purposes, a mark-to-market method of accounting for the hedge and all similar or related transactions.
(iii) Both the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge are entered into by the same individual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation (regardless of whether the corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return).
(iv) If the taxpayer is a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or business and the taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument, or enters into a § 1.1275-6 hedge, through the trade or business, all items of income and expense associated with the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge (other than interest expense that is subject to § 1.882-5) would have been effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business throughout the term of the qualifying debt instrument had this section not applied.
(v) Neither the qualifying debt instrument, nor any other debt instrument that is part of the same issue as the qualifying debt instrument, nor the § 1.1275-6 hedge was, with respect to the taxpayer, part of an integrated transaction that was terminated or otherwise legged out of within the 30 days immediately preceding the date that would be the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument.
(vi) The qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired by the taxpayer on or before the date of the first payment on the § 1.1275-6 hedge, whether made or received by the taxpayer (including a payment made to purchase the hedge). If the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired by the taxpayer after, but substantially contemporaneously with, the date of the first payment on the § 1.1275-6 hedge, the qualifying debt instrument is treated, solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(vi), as meeting the requirements of the preceding sentence.
(vii) Neither the § 1.1275-6 hedge nor the qualifying debt instrument was, with respect to the taxpayer, part of a straddle (as defined in section 1092(c)) prior to the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument.
(2)
Integration by Commissioner.
The Commissioner may treat a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument (whether entered into by the taxpayer or by a related party) as an integrated transaction if the combined cash flows on the qualifying debt instrument and financial instrument are substantially the same as the combined cash flows required for the financial instrument to be a § 1.1275-6 hedge. The Commissioner, however, may not integrate a transaction unless the qualifying debt instrument either is subject to § 1.1275-4 or is subject to § 1.1275-5 and pays interest at an objective rate. The circumstances under which the Commissioner may require integration include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) A taxpayer fails to identify a qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge under paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument and a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) enters into the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(iii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt instrument and enters into the § 1.1275-6 hedge with a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)).
(iv) The taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction and within 30 days enters into a new § 1.1275-6 hedge with respect to the same qualifying debt instrument or another debt instrument that is part of the same issue.
(d)
Special rules for legging into and legging out of an integrated transaction
—(1)
Legging into
—(i)
Definition.
Legging into an integrated transaction under this section means that a § 1.1275-6 hedge is entered into after the date the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired by the taxpayer, and the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied on the date the § 1.1275-6 hedge is entered into (the leg-in date).
(ii)
Treatment.
If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction, the taxpayer treats the qualifying debt instrument under the applicable rules for taking interest and OID into account up to the leg-in date, except that the day before the leg-in date is treated as the end of an accrual period. As of the leg-in date, the qualifying debt instrument is subject to the rules of paragraph (f) of this section.
(iii)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction with a principal purpose of deferring or accelerating income or deductions on the qualifying debt instrument, the Commissioner may—
(A) Treat the qualifying debt instrument as sold for its fair market value on the leg-in date; or
(B) Refuse to allow the taxpayer to integrate the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(2)
Legging out
—(i)
Definition
—(A)
Legging out if the taxpayer has integrated.
If a taxpayer has integrated a qualifying debt instrument and a § 1.1275-6 hedge under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, legging out means that, prior to the maturity of the synthetic debt instrument, the § 1.1275-6 hedge ceases to meet the requirements for a § 1.1275-6 hedge, the taxpayer fails to meet any requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the taxpayer disposes of or otherwise terminates all or a part of the qualifying debt instrument or § 1.1275-6 hedge. If the taxpayer fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section but meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commissioner may treat the taxpayer as not legging out.
(B)
Legging out if the Commissioner has integrated.
If the Commissioner has integrated a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, legging out means that, prior to the maturity of the synthetic debt instrument, the requirements for Commissioner integration under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not met or the taxpayer fails to meet the requirements for taxpayer integration under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the Commissioner agrees to allow the taxpayer to be treated as legging out.
(C)
Exception for certain nonrecognition transactions.
If, in a single nonrecognition transaction, a taxpayer disposes of, or ceases to be primarily liable on, the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, the taxpayer is not treated as legging out. Instead, the integrated transaction is treated under
the rules governing the nonrecognition transaction. For example, if a holder of an integrated transaction is acquired in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A), the holder is treated as disposing of the synthetic debt instrument in the reorganization rather than legging out. If the successor holder is not eligible for integrated treatment, the successor is treated as legging out.
(ii)
Operating rules.
If a taxpayer legs out (or is treated as legging out) of an integrated transaction, the following rules apply:
(A) The transaction is treated as an integrated transaction during the time the requirements of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, are satisfied.
(B) Immediately before the taxpayer legs out, the taxpayer is treated as selling or otherwise terminating the synthetic debt instrument for its fair market value and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, any income, deduction, gain, or loss is realized and recognized at that time.
(C) If, immediately after the taxpayer legs out, the taxpayer holds or remains primarily liable on the qualifying debt instrument, adjustments are made to reflect any difference between the fair market value of the qualifying debt instrument and the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument. If, immediately after the taxpayer legs out, the taxpayer is a party to a § 1.1275-6 hedge, the § 1.1275-6 hedge is treated as entered into at its fair market value.
(D) If a taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction by disposing of or otherwise terminating a § 1.1275-6 hedge within 30 days of legging into the integrated transaction, then any loss or deduction determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is not allowed. Appropriate adjustments are made to the qualifying debt instrument for any disallowed loss. The adjustments are taken into account on a yield to maturity basis over the remaining term of the qualifying debt instrument.
(E) If a holder of a debt instrument subject to § 1.1275-4 legs into an integrated transaction with respect to the instrument and subsequently legs out of the integrated transaction, any gain recognized under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section is treated as interest income to the extent determined under the principles of § 1.1275-4(b)(8)(iii)(B) (rules for determining the character of gain on the sale of a debt instrument all of the payments on which have been fixed). If the synthetic debt instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument determined under § 1.1275-5(e) is used for this purpose.
(e)
Identification requirements.
For each integrated transaction, a taxpayer must enter and retain as part of its books and records the following information—
(1) The date the qualifying debt instrument was issued or acquired (or is expected to be issued or acquired) by the taxpayer and the date the § 1.1275-6 hedge was entered into by the taxpayer;
(2) A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge; and
(3) A summary of the cash flows and accruals resulting from treating the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge as an integrated transaction (i.e., the cash flows and accruals on the synthetic debt instrument).
(f)
Taxation of integrated transactions
—(1)
General rule.
An integrated transaction is generally treated as a single transaction by the taxpayer during the period that the transaction qualifies as an integrated transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(12) of this section, while a qualifying debt instrument and a § 1.1275-6 hedge are part of an integrated transaction, neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the § 1.1275-6 hedge is subject to the rules that would apply on a separate basis to the debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, including section 1092 or § 1.446-4. The rules that would govern the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument generally govern the treatment of the integrated transaction. For example, the integrated transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or, if the synthetic debt instrument would be part of a straddle, section 1092. Generally, the synthetic debt instrument is subject to sections 163(e)
and 1271 through 1275, with terms as set forth in paragraphs (f) (2) through (13) of this section.
(2)
Issue date.
The issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the first date on which the taxpayer entered into all of the components of the synthetic debt instrument.
(3)
Term.
The term of the synthetic debt instrument is the period beginning on the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument and ending on the maturity date of the qualifying debt instrument.
(4)
Issue price.
The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument on the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument. If, as a result of entering into the § 1.1275-6 hedge, the taxpayer pays or receives one or more payments that are substantially contemporaneous with the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument, the payments reduce or increase the issue price as appropriate.
(5)
Adjusted issue price.
In general, the adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is determined under the principles of § 1.1275-1(b).
(6)
Qualified stated interest.
No amounts payable on the synthetic debt instrument are qualified stated interest within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c).
(7)
Stated redemption price at maturity
—(i)
Synthetic debt instruments that are borrowings.
In general, if the synthetic debt instrument is a borrowing, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts paid or to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by any amounts received or to be received on the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(ii)
Synthetic debt instruments that are held by the taxpayer.
In general, if the synthetic debt instrument is held by the taxpayer, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts received or to be received by the taxpayer on the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by any amounts paid or to be paid by the taxpayer on the § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(iii)
Certain amounts ignored.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(7), if an amount paid or received on the § 1.1275-6 hedge is taken into account under paragraph (f)(4) of this section to determine the issue price of the synthetic debt instrument, the amount is not taken into account to determine the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.
(8)
Source of interest income and allocation of expense.
The source of interest income from the synthetic debt instrument is determined by reference to the source of income of the qualifying debt instrument under sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1). For purposes of section 904, the character of interest from the synthetic debt instrument is determined by reference to the character of the interest income from the qualifying debt instrument. Interest expense is allocated and apportioned under regulations under section 861 or under § 1.882-5.
(9)
Effectively connected income.
If the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section are satisfied, any interest income resulting from the synthetic debt instrument entered into by the foreign person is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and any interest expense resulting from the synthetic debt instrument entered into by the foreign person is allocated and apportioned under § 1.882-5.
(10)
Not a short-term obligation.
For purposes of section 1272(a)(2)(C), a synthetic debt instrument is not treated as a short-term obligation.
(11)
Special rules in the event of integration by the Commissioner.
If the Commissioner requires integration, appropriate adjustments are made to the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument, and, if necessary, the qualifying debt instrument and financial instrument. For example, the Commissioner may treat a financial instrument that is not a § 1.1275-6 hedge as a § 1.1275-6 hedge when applying the rules of this section. The issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the date determined appropriate by the Commissioner to require integration.
(12)
Retention of separate transaction rules for certain purposes.
This paragraph (f)(12) provides for the retention of separate transaction rules for certain purposes. In addition, by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter),
the Commissioner may require use of separate transaction rules for any aspect of an integrated transaction.
(i)
Foreign persons that enter into integrated transactions giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
If a foreign person enters into an integrated transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest income (determined under the source rules for the synthetic debt instrument) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign person, paragraph (f) of this section does not apply for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442, and 6049. These sections of the Internal Revenue Code are applied to the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge on a separate basis.
(ii)
Relationship between taxpayer and other persons.
Because the rules of this section affect only the taxpayer that enters into an integrated transaction (i.e., either the issuer or a particular holder of a qualifying debt instrument), any provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations that govern the relationship between the taxpayer and any other person are applied on a separate basis. For example, taxpayers must comply with any reporting or disclosure requirements on any qualifying debt instrument as if it were not part of an integrated transaction. Thus, if required under § 1.1275-4(b)(4), an issuer of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to integrated treatment must provide the projected payment schedule to holders. Similarly, if a U.S. corporation enters into an integrated transaction that includes a notional principal contract, the source of any payment received by the counterparty on the notional principal contract is determined under § 1.863-7 as if the contract were not part of an integrated transaction, and, if received by a foreign person who is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the payment is non-U.S. source income that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax.
(13)
Coordination with consolidated return rules.
If a taxpayer enters into a § 1.1275-6 hedge with a member of the same consolidated group (the counterparty) and the § 1.1275-6 hedge is part of an integrated transaction for the taxpayer, the § 1.1275-6 hedge is not treated as an intercompany transaction for purposes of § 1.1502-13. If the taxpayer legs out of integrated treatment, the taxpayer and the counterparty are each treated as disposing of its position in the § 1.1275-6 hedge under the principles of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the § 1.1275-6 hedge remains in existence after the leg-out date, the § 1.1275-6 hedge is treated under the rules that would otherwise apply to the transaction (including § 1.1502-13 if the transaction is between members).
(g)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this section, any reference to a taxpayer, holder, issuer, or person includes, where appropriate, a reference to a predecessor or successor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a predecessor is a transferor of an asset or liability (including an integrated transaction) to a transferee (the successor) in a nonrecognition transaction. Appropriate adjustments, if necessary, are made in the application of this section to predecessors and successors.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example, assume that the qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument is a debt instrument for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 1. Issuer hedge.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1997, V, a domestic corporation, issues a 5-year debt instrument for $1,000. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR and a principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. On the same day, V enters into a 5-year interest rate swap agreement with an unrelated party. Under the swap, V pays 6 percent and receives 1-year LIBOR on a notional principal amount of $1,000. The payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same days as the payments on the debt instrument. On January 1, 1997, V identifies the debt instrument and the swap as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility for integration.
The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument. The swap is a § 1.1275-6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. V has met the identification requirements, and the
other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section.
(iii)
Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.
The synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an issue price of $1,000 and provides for annual interest payments of $60 and a principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. Under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no amounts payable on the synthetic debt instrument are qualified stated interest. Thus, under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,300 (the sum of all amounts to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and the swap, reduced by amounts to be received on the swap). The synthetic debt instrument, therefore, has $300 of OID.

# Example 2. Issuer hedge with an option.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, W, a domestic corporation, issues for $1,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 1999. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000 payable at maturity. The debt instrument also provides for a payment at maturity equal to $10 times the increase, if any, in the value of a nationally known composite index of stocks from December 31, 1996, to the maturity date. On December 31, 1996, W purchases from an unrelated party an option that pays $10 times the increase, if any, in the stock index from December 31, 1996, to December 31, 1999. W pays $250 for the option. On December 31, 1996, W identifies the debt instrument and option as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility for integration.
The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument. The option is a § 1.1275-6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the option and the debt instrument can be calculated. W has met the identification requirements, and the other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section.
(iii)
Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.
Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is equal to the issue price of the debt instrument ($1,000) reduced by the payment for the option ($250). As a result, the synthetic debt instrument is a 3-year debt instrument with an issue price of $750. Under paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 (the $250 payment for the option is not taken into account). The synthetic debt instrument, therefore, has $250 of OID.

# Example 3. Hedge with prepaid swap.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1997, H purchases for £1,000 a 5-year debt instrument that provides for semiannual payments based on 6-month pound LIBOR and a payment of the £1,000 principal at maturity. On the same day, H enters into a swap with an unrelated third party under which H receives semiannual payments, in pounds, of 10 percent, compounded semiannually, and makes semiannual payments, in pounds, of 6-month pound LIBOR on a notional principal amount of £1,000. Payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same dates as the payments on the debt instrument. H also makes a £162 prepayment on the swap. On January 1, 1997, H identifies the swap and the debt instrument as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility for integration.
The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument. The swap is a § 1.1275-6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. Although the debt instrument is denominated in pounds, the swap hedges only interest rate risk, not currency risk. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section. See § 1.988-5(a) for the treatment of a debt instrument and a swap if the swap hedges currency risk.
(iii)
Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.
Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is equal to the issue price of the debt instrument (£1,000) increased by the prepayment on the swap (£162). As a result, the synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an issue price of £1,162 and provides for semiannual interest payments of £50 and a principal payment of £1,000 at maturity. Under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no amounts payable on the synthetic debt instrument are qualified stated interest. Thus, under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is £1,500 (the sum of all amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the § 1.1275-6 hedge other than the £162 prepayment for the swap). The synthetic debt instrument, therefore, has £338 of OID.

# Example 4. Legging into an integrated transaction by a holder.
(i)
Facts.
On December 31, 1996, X corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2006. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity equal to $1,000,000, increased by the excess, if any, of the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on December 31, 2006, over $350,000, and decreased by the excess, if any, of $350,000 over the price of 1,000 units of the commodity on that date. The projected amount of the payment at maturity determined under § 1.1275-4(b)(4) is $1,020,000. On December 31, 1999, X
enters into a cash-settled forward contract with an unrelated party to sell 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2006, for $450,000. On December 31, 1999, X also identifies the debt instrument and the forward contract as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility for integration.
X meets the requirements for integration as of December 31, 1999. Therefore, X legged into an integrated transaction on that date. Prior to that date, X treats the debt instrument under the applicable rules of § 1.1275-4.
(iii)
Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.
As of December 31, 1999, the debt instrument and the forward contract are treated as an integrated transaction. The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is equal to the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument on the leg-in date, $1,004,804 (assuming one year accrual periods). The term of the synthetic debt instrument is from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2006. The synthetic debt instrument provides for annual interest payments of $60,000 and a principal payment at maturity of $1,100,000 ($1,000,000 + $450,000 − $350,000). Under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no amounts payable on the synthetic debt instrument are qualified stated interest. Thus, under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is $1,520,000 (the sum of all amounts to be received by X on the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid by X on the § 1.1275-6 hedge). The synthetic debt instrument, therefore, has $515,196 of OID.

# Example 5. Abusive leg-in.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1997, Y corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2001. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent, a payment on December 31, 1999, of the increase, if any, in the price of a commodity from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 1999, and a payment at maturity of $1,000,000 and the increase, if any, in the price of the commodity from December 31, 1999 to maturity. Because the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument subject to § 1.1275-4, Y accrues interest based on the projected payment schedule.
(ii)
Leg-in.
By late 1999, the price of the commodity has substantially increased, and Y expects a positive adjustment on December 31, 1999. In late 1999, Y enters into an agreement to exchange the two commodity based payments on the debt instrument for two payments on the same dates of $100,000 each. Y identifies the transaction as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. Y disposes of the hedge in early 2000.
(iii)
Treatment.
The legging into an integrated transaction has the effect of deferring the positive adjustment from 1999 to 2000. Because Y legged into the integrated transaction with a principal purpose to defer the positive adjustment, the Commissioner may treat the debt instrument as sold for its fair market value on the leg-in date or refuse to allow integration.

# Example 6. Integration of offsetting debt instruments.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 1997, Z issues two 10-year debt instruments. The first, Issue 1, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest annually at 6 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, increased by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S
P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and reduced by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S
P 100 Index over the term of the instrument. However, the amount paid at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. The second, Issue 2, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest annually at 8 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, reduced by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S
P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and increased by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S
P 100 Index over the term of the instrument. The amount paid at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. On January 1, 1997, Z identifies Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument, Issue 2 as a § 1.1275-6 hedge, and otherwise meets the identification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii)
Eligibility for integration.
Both Issue 1 and Issue 2 are qualifying debt instruments. Z has met the identification requirements by identifying Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument and Issue 2 as the § 1.1275-6 hedge. The other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section.
(iii)
Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.
The synthetic debt instrument has an issue price of $2,000, provides for a payment at maturity of $2,000, and, in addition, provides for annual payments of $140. Under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no amounts payable on the synthetic debt instrument are qualified stated interest. Thus, under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is $3,400 (the sum of all amounts to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by amounts to be received on the § 1.1275-6 hedge other than the $1,000 payment received on the issue date). The synthetic debt instrument, therefore, has $1,400 of OID.

# Example 7. Integrated transaction entered into by a foreign person.
(i)
Facts.
X, a foreign person, enters into an integrated transaction by purchasing a qualifying debt instrument that pays U.S. source interest and entering into a notional principal contract with a U.S. corporation. Neither the income from
the qualifying debt instrument nor the income from the notional principal contract is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The notional principal contract is a § 1.1275-6 hedge.
(ii)
Treatment of integrated transaction.
Under paragraph (f)(8) of this section, X will receive U.S. source income from the integrated transaction. However, under paragraph (f)(12)(i) of this section, the qualifying debt instrument and the notional principal contract are treated as if they are not part of an integrated transaction for purposes of determining whether tax is due and must be withheld on income. Accordingly, because the § 1.1275-6 hedge would produce foreign source income under § 1.863-7 to X if it were not part of an integrated transaction, any income on the § 1.1275-6 hedge generally will not be subject to tax under sections 871(a) and 881, and the U.S. corporation that is the counterparty will not be required to withhold tax on payments under the § 1.1275-6 hedge under sections 1441 and 1442.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Effective date.
This section applies to a qualifying debt instrument issued on or after August 13, 1996. This section also applies to a qualifying debt instrument acquired by the taxpayer on or after August 13, 1996, if—
(1) The qualifying debt instrument is a fixed rate debt instrument or a variable rate debt instrument; or
(2) The qualifying debt instrument and the § 1.1275-6 hedge are acquired by the taxpayer substantially contemporaneously.
[T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30155, June 14, 1996]
§ 1.1275-7
Inflation-indexed debt instruments.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules for the Federal income tax treatment of an inflation-indexed debt instrument. If a debt instrument is an inflation-indexed debt instrument, one of two methods will apply to the instrument: the coupon bond method (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) or the discount bond method (as described in paragraph (e) of this section). Both methods determine the amount of OID that is taken into account each year by a holder or an issuer of an inflation-indexed debt instrument.
(b)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this section applies to an inflation-indexed debt instrument as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, this section applies to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
(2)
Exceptions.
This section does not apply to an inflation-indexed debt instrument that is also—
(i) A debt instrument (other than a tax-exempt obligation) described in section 1272(a)(2) (for example, U.S. savings bonds, certain loans between natural persons, and short-term taxable obligations); or
(ii) A debt instrument subject to section 529 (certain debt instruments issued by qualified state tuition programs).
(c)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1)
Inflation-indexed debt instrument.
An inflation-indexed debt instrument is a debt instrument that satisfies the following conditions:
(i)
Issued for cash.
The debt instrument is issued for U.S. dollars and all payments on the instrument are denominated in U.S. dollars.
(ii)
Indexed for inflation and deflation.
Except for a minimum guarantee payment (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), each payment on the debt instrument is indexed for inflation and deflation. A payment is indexed for inflation and deflation if the amount of the payment is equal to—
(A) The amount that would be payable if there were no inflation or deflation over the term of the debt instrument, multiplied by
(B) A ratio, the numerator of which is the value of the reference index for the date of the payment and the denominator of which is the value of the reference index for the issue date.
(iii)
No other contingencies.
No payment on the debt instrument is subject to a contingency other than the inflation contingency or the contingencies described in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii). A debt instrument may provide for—
(A) A minimum guarantee payment as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section; or
(B) Payments under one or more alternate payment schedules if the payments under each payment schedule are indexed for inflation and deflation and a payment schedule for the debt instrument can be determined under
§ 1.1272-1(c). (For purposes of this section, the rules of § 1.1272-1(c) are applied to the debt instrument by assuming that no inflation or deflation will occur over the term of the instrument.)
(2)
Reference index.
The reference index is an index used to measure inflation and deflation over the term of a debt instrument. To qualify as a reference index, an index must satisfy the following conditions:
(i) The value of the index is reset once a month to a current value of a single qualified inflation index (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). For this purpose, a value of a qualified inflation index is current if the value has been updated and published within the preceding six month period.
(ii) The reset occurs on the same day of each month (the reset date).
(iii) The value of the index for any date between reset dates is determined through straight-line interpolation.
(3)
Qualified inflation index.
A qualified inflation index is a general price or wage index that is updated and published at least monthly by an agency of the United States Government (for example, the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor).
(4)
Inflation-adjusted principal amount.
For any date, the inflation-adjusted principal amount of an inflation-indexed debt instrument is an amount equal to—
(i) The outstanding principal amount of the debt instrument (determined as if there were no inflation or deflation over the term of the instrument), multiplied by
(ii) A ratio, the numerator of which is the value of the reference index for the date and the denominator of which is the value of the reference index for the issue date.
(5)
Minimum guarantee payment.
In general, a minimum guarantee payment is an additional payment made at maturity on a debt instrument if the total amount of inflation-adjusted principal paid on the instrument is less than the instrument's stated principal amount. The amount of the additional payment must be no more than the excess, if any, of the debt instrument's stated principal amount over the total amount of inflation-adjusted principal paid on the instrument. An additional payment is not a minimum guarantee payment unless the qualified inflation index used to determine the reference index is either the CPI-U or an index designated for this purpose by the Commissioner in the
Federal Register
or the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). See paragraph (f)(4) of this section for the treatment of a minimum guarantee payment.
(d)
Coupon bond method
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) describes the method (coupon bond method) to be used to account for qualified stated interest and inflation adjustments (OID) on an inflation-indexed debt instrument described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Applicability.
The coupon bond method applies to an inflation-indexed debt instrument that satisfies the following conditions:
(i)
Issued at par.
The debt instrument is issued at par. A debt instrument is issued at par if the difference between its issue price and principal amount for the issue date is less than the de minimis amount. For this purpose, the de minimis amount is determined using the principles of § 1.1273-1(d). See paragraph (g)(2) of this section, however, for the treatment of TIPS issued with more than a de minimis amount of premium.
(ii)
All stated interest is qualified stated interest.
All stated interest on the debt instrument is qualified stated interest. For purposes of this paragraph (d), stated interest is qualified stated interest if the interest is unconditionally payable in cash, or is constructively received under section 451, at least annually at a single fixed rate. Stated interest is payable at a single fixed rate if the amount of each interest payment is determined by multiplying the inflation adjusted principal amount for the payment date by the single fixed rate.
(3)
Qualified stated interest.
Under the coupon bond method, qualified stated interest is taken into account under the taxpayer's regular method of accounting. The amount of accrued but
unpaid qualified stated interest as of any date is determined by using the principles of § 1.446-3(e)(2)(ii) (relating to notional principal contracts). For example, if the interval between interest payment dates spans two taxable years, a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting determines the amount of accrued qualified stated interest for the first taxable year by reference to the inflation-adjusted principal amount at the end of the first taxable year.
(4)
Inflation adjustments
—(i)
Current accrual.
Under the coupon bond method, an inflation adjustment is taken into account for each taxable year in which the debt instrument is outstanding.
(ii)
Amount of inflation adjustment.
For any relevant period (such as the taxable year or the portion of the taxable year during which a taxpayer holds an inflation-indexed debt instrument), the amount of the inflation adjustment is equal to—
(A) The sum of the inflation-adjusted principal amount at the end of the period and the principal payments made during the period, minus
(B) The inflation-adjusted principal amount at the beginning of the period.
(iii)
Positive inflation adjustments.
A positive inflation adjustment is OID.
(iv)
Negative inflation adjustments.
A negative inflation adjustment is a deflation adjustment that is taken into account under the rules of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the coupon bond method:

# Example:
(i)
Facts.
On October 15, 1997, X purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that is indexed for inflation and deflation. The debt instrument matures on October 15, 1999, has a stated principal amount of $100,000, and has a stated interest rate of 5 percent, compounded semiannually. The debt instrument provides that the principal amount is indexed to the CPI-U. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The amount of each interest payment is determined by multiplying the inflation-adjusted principal amount for each interest payment date by the stated interest rate, adjusted for the length of the accrual period. The debt instrument provides for a single payment of the inflation-adjusted principal amount at maturity. In addition, the debt instrument provides for an additional payment at maturity equal to the excess, if any, of $100,000 over the inflation-adjusted principal amount at maturity. X uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year.
(ii)
Indexing methodology.
The debt instrument provides that the inflation-adjusted principal amount for any day is determined by multiplying the principal amount of the instrument for the issue date by a ratio, the numerator of which is the value of the reference index for the day the inflation-adjusted principal amount is to be determined and the denominator of which is the value of the reference index for the issue date. The value of the reference index for the first day of a month is the value of the CPI-U for the third preceding month. The value of the reference index for any day other than the first day of a month is determined based on a straight-line interpolation between the value of the reference index for the first day of the month and the value of the reference index for the first day of the next month.
(iii)
Inflation-indexed debt instrument subject to the coupon bond method.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the debt instrument is an inflation-indexed debt instrument. Because there is no difference between the debt instrument's issue price ($100,000) and its principal amount for the issue date ($100,000) and because all stated interest is qualified stated interest, the coupon bond method applies to the instrument.
(iv)
Reference index values.
Assume the following table lists the relevant reference index values for 1997 through 1999:
Date
Reference index value
Oct. 15, 1997
100
Jan. 1, 1998
101
Apr. 15, 1998
103
Oct. 15, 1998
105
Jan. 1, 1999
99
(v)
Treatment of X in 1997.
X does not receive any payments of interest on the debt instrument in 1997. Therefore, X has no qualified stated interest income for 1997. X, however, must take into account the inflation adjustment for 1997. The inflation-adjusted principal amount for January 1, 1998, is $101,000 ($100,000 × 101/100). Therefore, the inflation adjustment for 1997 is $1,000, the inflation-adjusted principal amount for January 1, 1998 ($101,000) minus the principal amount for the issue date ($100,000). X includes the $1,000 inflation adjustment in income as OID in 1997.
(vi)
Treatment of X in 1998.
In 1998, X receives two payments of interest: On April 15, 1998, X receives a payment of $2,575 ($100,000 × 103/100 × .05/2), and on October 15, 1998, X receives a payment of $2,625 ($100,000 × 105/100 × .05/2). Therefore, X's qualified stated interest income for 1998 is $5,200 ($2,575 + $2,625). X
also must take into account the inflation adjustment for 1998. The inflation-adjusted principal amount for January 1, 1999, is $99,000 ($100,000 × 99/100). Therefore, the inflation adjustment for 1998 is negative $2,000, the inflation-adjusted principal amount for January 1, 1999 ($99,000) minus the inflation-adjusted principal amount for January 1, 1998 ($101,000). Because the amount of the inflation adjustment is negative, it is a deflation adjustment. Under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, X uses this $2,000 deflation adjustment to reduce the interest otherwise includible in income by X with respect to the debt instrument in 1998. Therefore, X includes $3,200 in income for 1998, the qualified stated interest income for 1998 ($5,200) minus the deflation adjustment ($2,000).
(e)
Discount bond method
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) describes the method (discount bond method) to be used to account for OID on an inflation-indexed debt instrument that does not qualify for the coupon bond method.
(2)
No qualified stated interest.
Under the discount bond method, no interest on an inflation-indexed debt instrument is qualified stated interest.
(3)
OID.
Under the discount bond method, the amount of OID that accrues on an inflation-indexed debt instrument is determined as follows:
(i)
Step one: Determine the debt instrument's yield to maturity.
The yield of the debt instrument is determined under the rules of § 1.1272-1(b)(1)(i). In calculating the yield under those rules for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(i), the payment schedule of the debt instrument is determined as if there were no inflation or deflation over the term of the instrument.
(ii)
Step two: Determine the accrual periods.
The accrual periods are determined under the rules of § 1.1272-1(b)(1)(ii). However, no accrual period can be longer than 1 month.
(iii)
Step three: Determine the percentage change in the reference index during the accrual period.
The percentage change in the reference index during the accrual period is equal to—
(A) The ratio of the value of the reference index at the end of the period to the value of the reference index at the beginning of the period,
(B) Minus one.
(iv)
Step four: Determine the OID allocable to each accrual period.
The OID allocable to an accrual period (n) is determined by using the following formula:
OID(
(n)
= AIP
(n)
× [r + inf
(n)
+ (r × inf
(n)
)]
in which,
r = yield of the debt instrument as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section (adjusted for the length of the accrual period);
inf
(n)
= percentage change in the value of the reference index for period (n) as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section; and
AIP
(n)
= adjusted issue price at the beginning of period (n).
(v)
Step five: Determine the daily portions of OID.
The daily portions of OID are determined and taken into account under the rules of § 1.1272-1(b)(1)(iv). If the daily portions determined under this paragraph (e)(3)(v) are negative amounts, however, these amounts (deflation adjustments) are taken into account under the rules for deflation adjustments described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the discount bond method:

# Example:
(i)
Facts.
On November 15, 1997, X purchases at original issue, for $91,403, a zero-coupon debt instrument that is indexed for inflation and deflation. The principal amount of the debt instrument for the issue date is $100,000. The debt instrument provides for a single payment on November 15, 2000. The amount of the payment will be determined by multiplying $100,000 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the CPI-U for September 2000, and the denominator of which is the CPI-U for September 1997. The debt instrument also provides that in no event will the payment on November 15, 2000, be less than $100,000. X uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year.
(ii)
Inflation-indexed debt instrument.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the instrument is an inflation-indexed debt instrument. The debt instrument's principal amount for the issue date ($100,000) exceeds its issue price ($91,403) by $8,597, which is more than the de minimis amount for the debt instrument ($750). Therefore, the coupon bond method does not apply to the debt instrument. As a result, the discount bond method applies to the debt instrument.
(iii)
Yield and accrual period.
Assume X chooses monthly accrual periods ending on the 15th day of each month. The yield of the debt instrument is determined as if there were no inflation or deflation over the term of the instrument. Therefore, based on the
issue price of $91,403 and an assumed payment at maturity of $100,000, the yield of the debt instrument is 3 percent, compounded monthly.
(iv)
Percentage change in reference index.
Assume that the CPI-U for September 1997 is 160; for October 1997 is 161.2; and for November 1997 is 161.7. The value of the reference index for November 15, 1997, is 160, the value of the CPI-U for September 1997. Similarly, the value of the reference index for December 15, 1997, is 161.2, and for January 15, 1998, is 161.7. The percentage change in the reference index from November 15, 1997, to December 15, 1997, (inf
1
) is 0.0075 (161.2/160-1); the percentage change in the reference index from December 15, 1997, to January 15, 1998, (inf
2
) is 0.0031 (161.7/161.2-1).
(v)
Treatment of X in 1997.
For the accrual period ending on December 15, 1997, r is .0025 (.03/12), inf
1
is .0075, and the product of r and inf
1
is .00001875. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the amount of OID allocable to the accrual period ending on December 15, 1997, is $916. This amount is determined by multiplying the issue price of the debt instrument ($91,403) by .01001875 (the sum of r, inf
1
, and the product of r and inf
1
). The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument on December 15, 1997, is $92,319 ($91,403 + $916). For the accrual period ending on January 15, 1998, r is .0025 (.03/12), inf
2
is .0031, and the product of r and inf
2
is .00000775. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the amount of OID allocable to the accrual period ending on January 15, 1998, is $518. This amount is determined by multiplying the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument ($92,319) by .00560775 (the sum of r, inf
2
, and the product of r and inf
2
). Because the accrual period ending on January 15, 1998, spans two taxable years, only $259 of this amount ($518/30 days × 15 days) is allocable to 1997. Therefore, X includes $1,175 of OID in income for 1997 ($916 + $259).
(f)
Special rules.
The following rules apply to an inflation-indexed debt instrument:
(1)
Deflation adjustments
—(i)
Holder.
A deflation adjustment reduces the amount of interest otherwise includible in income by a holder with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(i), interest includes OID, qualified stated interest, and market discount. If the amount of the deflation adjustment exceeds the interest otherwise includible in income by the holder with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year, the excess is treated as an ordinary loss by the holder for the taxable year. However, the amount treated as an ordinary loss is limited to the amount by which the holder's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument in prior taxable years exceed the total amount treated by the holder as an ordinary loss on the debt instrument in prior taxable years. If the deflation adjustment exceeds the interest otherwise includible in income by the holder with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year and the amount treated as an ordinary loss for the taxable year, this excess is carried forward to reduce the amount of interest otherwise includible in income by the holder with respect to the debt instrument for subsequent taxable years.
(ii)
Issuer.
A deflation adjustment reduces the interest otherwise deductible by the issuer with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(ii), interest includes OID and qualified stated interest. If the amount of the deflation adjustment exceeds the interest otherwise deductible by the issuer with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year, the excess is treated as ordinary income by the issuer for the taxable year. However, the amount treated as ordinary income is limited to the amount by which the issuer's total interest deductions on the debt instrument in prior taxable years exceed the total amount treated by the issuer as ordinary income on the debt instrument in prior taxable years. If the deflation adjustment exceeds the interest otherwise deductible by the issuer with respect to the debt instrument for the taxable year and the amount treated as ordinary income for the taxable year, this excess is carried forward to reduce the interest otherwise deductible by the issuer with respect to the debt instrument for subsequent taxable years. If there is any excess remaining upon the retirement of the debt instrument, the issuer takes the excess amount into account as ordinary income.
(2)
Adjusted basis.
A holder's adjusted basis in an inflation-indexed debt instrument is determined under § 1.1272-1(g). However, a holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is decreased by the amount of any deflation adjustment the holder takes into account to reduce the amount of interest otherwise includible in income or treats as
an ordinary loss with respect to the instrument during the taxable year. The decrease occurs when the deflation adjustment is taken into account under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(3)
Subsequent holders.
A holder determines the amount of acquisition premium or market discount on an inflation-indexed debt instrument by reference to the adjusted issue price of the instrument on the date the holder acquires the instrument. A holder determines the amount of bond premium on an inflation-indexed debt instrument by assuming that the amount payable at maturity on the instrument is equal to the instrument's inflation-adjusted principal amount for the day the holder acquires the instrument. Any premium or market discount is taken into account over the remaining term of the debt instrument as if there were no further inflation or deflation. See section 171 for additional rules relating to the amortization of bond premium and sections 1276 through 1278 for additional rules relating to market discount.
(4)
Minimum guarantee.
Under both the coupon bond method and the discount bond method, a minimum guarantee payment is ignored until the payment is made. If there is a minimum guarantee payment, the payment is treated as interest on the date it is paid.
(5)
Temporary unavailability of a qualified inflation index.
Notwithstanding any other rule of this section, an inflation-indexed debt instrument may provide for a substitute value of the qualified inflation index if and when the publication of the value of the qualified inflation index is temporarily delayed. The substitute value may be determined by the issuer under any reasonable method. For example, if the CPI-U is not reported for a particular month, the debt instrument may provide that a substitute value may be determined by increasing the last reported value by the average monthly percentage increase in the qualified inflation index over the preceding twelve months. The use of a substitute value does not result in a reissuance of the debt instrument.

For rules concerning a reopening of TIPS, see paragraphs (d)(2), (k)(3)(iii), and (k)(3)(v) of § 1.1275-2.
(2)
TIPS issued with more than a de minimis amount of premium
—(i)
Coupon bond method.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the coupon bond method described in paragraph (d) of this section applies to TIPS issued with more than a de minimis amount of premium. For this purpose, the de minimis amount is determined using the principles of § 1.1273-1(d).
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the bond premium rules to a TIPS issued with bond premium:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases at original issuance TIPS with a stated principal amount of $100,000 and a stated interest rate of .125 percent, compounded semiannually. For purposes of this example, assume that the TIPS are issued in Year 1 on January 1, stated interest is payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and that the TIPS mature on December 31, Year 5. X pays $102,000 for the TIPS, which is the issue price for the TIPS as determined under § 1.1275-2(d)(1). Assume that the inflation-adjusted principal amount for the first coupon in Year 1 is $101,225 (resulting in an interest payment of $63.27) and for the second coupon in Year 1 is $102,500 (resulting in an interest payment of $64.06). X elects to amortize bond premium under § 1.171-4. (For simplicity, contrary to actual practice, the TIPS in this example were issued on the date with respect to which the calculation of the first coupon began.)
(ii)
Bond premium.
The stated interest on the TIPS is qualified stated interest under § 1.1273-1(c). X acquired the TIPS with bond premium of $2,000 (basis of $102,000 minus the TIPS' stated principal amount of $100,000).
See
§§ 1.171-1(d), 1.171-3(b), and paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The $2,000 is more than the de minimis amount of premium for the TIPS of $1,250 (.0025 times the stated principal amount of the TIPS ($100,000) times the number of complete years to the TIPS' maturity (5 years)). Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, X must use the coupon bond method to determine X's income from the TIPS.
(iii)
Allocation of bond premium.
Under § 1.171-3(b), the bond premium of $2,000 is allocable to each semiannual accrual period by assuming that there will be no inflation or deflation over the term of the TIPS. Moreover, for purposes of § 1.171-2, the yield of the securities is determined by assuming that there will be no inflation or deflation over their term. Based on this assumption, for purposes of section 171, the TIPS provide for
semiannual interest payments of $62.50 and a $100,000 payment at maturity. As a result, the yield of the securities for purposes of section 171 is −0.2720 percent, compounded semiannually. Under § 1.171-2, the bond premium allocable to an accrual period is the excess of the qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($62.50 for each accrual period) over the product of the taxpayer's adjusted acquisition price at the beginning of the accrual period (determined without regard to any inflation or deflation) and the taxpayer's yield. Therefore, the $2,000 of bond premium is allocable to each semiannual accrual period in Year 1 as follows: $201.22 to the accrual period ending on June 30, Year 1 (the excess of the stated interest of $62.50 over ($102,000 × −0.002720/2)); and $200.95 to the accrual period ending on December 31, Year 1 (the excess of the stated interest of $62.50 over ($101,798.78 × −0. 002720/2)). The adjusted acquisition price at the beginning of the accrual period ending on December 31, Year 1 is $101,798.78 (the adjusted acquisition price of $102,000 at the beginning of the accrual period ending on June 30, Year 1 reduced by the $201.22 of premium allocable to that accrual period).
(iv)
Income determined by applying the coupon bond method and the bond premium rules.
Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the application of the coupon bond method to the TIPS results in a positive inflation adjustment in Year 1 of $2,500, which is includible in X's income for Year 1. However, because X acquired the TIPS at a premium and elected to amortize the premium, the premium allocable to Year 1 will offset the income on the TIPS as follows: The premium allocable to the first accrual period of $201.22 first offsets the interest payable for that period of $63.27. The remaining $137.95 of premium is treated as a deflation adjustment that offsets the positive inflation adjustment.
See
§ 1.171-3(b). The premium allocable to the second accrual period of $200.95 first offsets the interest payable for that period of $64.06. The remaining $136.89 of premium is treated as a deflation adjustment that further offsets the positive inflation adjustment. As a result, X does not include in income any of the stated interest received in Year 1 and includes in Year 1 income only $2,225.16 of the positive inflation adjustment for Year 1 ($2,500 − $137.94 − $136.89).

§ 1.1286-1
Tax treatment of certain stripped bonds and stripped coupons.
(a)
De minimis OID.
If the original issue discount determined under section 1286(a) with respect to the purchase of a stripped bond or stripped coupon is less than the amount computed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1273(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder, then the amount of original issue discount with respect to that purchase (other than any tax-exempt portion thereof, determined under section 1286(d)(2)) shall be considered to be zero. For purposes of this computation, the number of complete years to maturity is measured from the date the stripped bond or stripped coupon is purchased.
(b)
Treatment of certain stripped bonds as market discount bonds
—(1)
In general.
By publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of the Statement of Procedural Rules), the Internal Revenue Service may (subject to the limitation of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) provide that certain mortgage loans that are stripped bonds are to be treated as market discount bonds under section 1278. Thus, any purchaser of such a bond is to account for any discount on the bond as market discount rather than original issue discount.
(2)
Limitation.
This treatment may be provided for a stripped bond only if, immediately after the most recent disposition referred to in section 1286(b)—
(i) The amount of original issue discount with respect to the stripped bond is determined under paragraph (a) of this section (concerning
de minimis
OID); or
(ii) The annual stated rate of interest payable on the stripped bond is no more than 100 basis points lower than the annual stated rate of interest payable on the original bond from which it and any other stripped bond or bonds
and any stripped coupon or coupons were stripped.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is effective on and after August 8, 1991.

Stripped inflation-protected debt instruments.
Stripped inflation-protected debt instruments.
If a Treasury Inflation-Protected Security is stripped under the Department of the Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) program, the holders of the principal and coupon components must use the discount bond method (as described in § 1.1275-7(e)) to account for the original issue discount on the components.
[T.D. 8709, 62 FR 621, Jan. 6, 1997. Redesignated by T.D. 8838, 64 FR 48547, Sept. 7, 1999; T.D. 9609, 78 FR 668, Jan. 4, 2013]
§ 1.1287-1
Denial of capital gains treatment for gains on registration-required obligations not in registered form.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any gain on the sale or other disposition of a registration-required obligation held after December 31, 1982, that is not in registered form shall be treated as ordinary income unless the issuance of the obligation was subject to tax under section 4701. The term
registration-required obligation
has the meaning given to that term in section 163(f)(2), except that clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) thereof shall not apply. Therefore, although an obligation that is not in registered form is described in § 1.163-5(c)(1), the holder of such an obligation shall be required to treat the gain on the sale or other disposition of such obligation as ordinary income. The term
holder
means the person that would be denied a loss deduction under section 165(j)(1) or denied capital gain treatment under section 1287(a).
(b)
Registered form
—(1)
Obligations issued after September 21, 1984.
With respect to any obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984, the term
registered form
has the meaning given that term in section 103(j)(3) and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, an obligation that would otherwise be in registered form is not considered to be in registered form if it can be transferred at that time or at any time until its maturity by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c). An obligation that, as of a particular time, is not considered to be in registered form because it can be transferred by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c) is considered to be in registered form at all times during the period beginning with a later time and ending with the maturity of the obligation in which the obligation can be transferred only by a means described in § 5f.103-1(c).
(2)
Obligations issued after December 31, 1982, and on or before September 21, 1984.
With respect to any obligation originally issued after December 31, 1982, and on or before September 21, 1984, or an obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984, pursuant to the exercise of a warrant or the conversion of a convertible obligation, which warrant or obligation (including conversion privilege) was issued after December 31, 1982, and on or before September 21, 1984, that obligation will be considered to be in registered form if it satisfied § 5f.163-1 or the proposed regulations provided in § 1.163.-5(c) and published in the
Federal Register
on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 39953).
(c)
Registration-required obligations not in registered form which are not subject to section 1287(c).
Notwithstanding the fact than an obligation is a registration-required obligation that is not in registered form, the holder will not be subject to section 1287(a) if the holder meets the conditions of § 1.165-12(c).
(d)
Effective date.
These regulations apply generally to obligations issued after January 20, 1987. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of § 1.1287-1 with respect to an obligation issued after December 31, 1982, and on or before January 20, 1987, which obligation is held after January 20, 1987.

§ 1.1288-1
Adjustment of applicable Federal rate for tax-exempt obligations.
(a)
In general.
In applying section 483 or section 1274 to a tax-exempt obligation, the applicable Federal rate is adjusted to take into account the tax exemption for interest on the obligation.
For each applicable Federal rate determined under section 1274(d), the Secretary computes a corresponding adjusted applicable Federal rate by multiplying the applicable Federal rate by the adjustment factor described in paragraph (b) of this section. The Internal Revenue Service publishes the applicable Federal rates and the adjusted applicable Federal rates for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(b)
Adjustment factor.
The adjustment factor is a percentage equal to—
(1) The excess of 100 percent, over
(2) The product of—
(i) 59 percent, and
(ii) The sum of the maximum rate in effect under section 1 applicable to individuals and the maximum rate in effect under section 1411 applicable to individuals for the month to which the adjusted applicable Federal rate applies.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to the determination of adjusted applicable Federal rates beginning with the rates determined during August 2016 that apply during September 2016.

(7)
Shareholder.
A
shareholder
is a United States person that directly owns stock of a PFIC (a direct shareholder), or that is an indirect shareholder (as defined in section 1298(a) and paragraph (b)(8) of this section), except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of sections 1291 and 1298, a domestic partnership or S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(1)) is not treated as a shareholder of a PFIC except for purposes of any information reporting requirements, including the requirement to file an annual report under section 1298(f). In addition, to the extent that a person is treated under sections 671 through 678 as the owner of a portion of a domestic trust, the trust is not treated as a shareholder of a PFIC with respect to PFIC stock held by that portion of the trust, except for purposes of the information reporting requirements of § 1.1298-1(b)(3)(i) (imposing an information reporting requirement on domestic liquidating trusts and fixed investment trusts).
(8)
Indirect shareholder
—(i)
In general.
An
indirect shareholder
of a PFIC is a United States person that indirectly owns stock of a PFIC. A person indirectly owns stock when it is treated as owning stock of a corporation owned by another person, including another United States person, under this paragraph (b)(8). In applying this paragraph (b)(8), the determination of a person's indirect ownership is made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in each case; the substance rather than the form of ownership is controlling, taking into account the purposes of sections 1291 through 1298.
(ii)
Ownership through a corporation
—(A)
Ownership through a non-PFIC foreign corporation.
A person that directly or indirectly owns 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC is considered to own a proportionate amount (by value) of any stock owned directly or indirectly by the foreign corporation.
(B)
Ownership through a PFIC.
A person that directly or indirectly owns stock of a PFIC is considered to own a proportionate amount (by value) of any stock owned directly or indirectly by the PFIC. Section 1297(d) does not apply in determining whether a corporation is a PFIC for purposes of this paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B).
(C)
Ownership through a domestic corporation
—(

)
In general.
Solely for purposes of determining whether a person satisfies the ownership threshold described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this
section, a person that directly or indirectly owns 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a domestic corporation is considered to own a proportionate amount (by value) of any stock owned directly or indirectly by the domestic corporation.
(

)
Non-duplication.
Paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section does not apply to treat a United States person as owning (other than for purposes of applying the ownership threshold in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section) stock of a PFIC that is directly owned or considered owned indirectly within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(8) by another United States person (determined without regard to paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
1
)). See
Example 1
of paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section.
(

)
S corporations.
The 50 percent limitation in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section does not apply with respect to stock owned directly or indirectly by an S corporation. See paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(B) of this section for rules regarding stock owned directly or indirectly by an S corporation.
(iii)
Ownership through pass-through entities
—(A)
Partnerships.
If a foreign or domestic partnership directly or indirectly owns stock, the partners of the partnership are considered to own such stock proportionately in accordance with their ownership interests in the partnership.
(B)
S Corporations.
If an S corporation directly or indirectly owns stock, each S corporation shareholder is considered to own such stock proportionately in accordance with the shareholder's ownership interest in the S corporation.
(C)
Estates and nongrantor trusts.
If a foreign or domestic estate or nongrantor trust (other than an employees' trust described in section 401(a) that is exempt from tax under section 501(a)) directly or indirectly owns stock, each beneficiary of the estate or trust is considered to own a proportionate amount of such stock. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(C), a nongrantor trust is any trust or portion of a trust that is not treated as owned by one or more persons under sections 671 through 679.
(D)
Grantor trusts.
If a foreign or domestic trust directly or indirectly owns stock, a person that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as the owner of any portion of the trust that holds an interest in the stock is considered to own the interest in the stock held by that portion of the trust.
(iv)
Successive application.
Stock considered to be owned by a person by reason of paragraphs (b)(8)(ii) or (iii) of this section is, for purposes of applying such paragraphs, considered to be actually owned by such person. Subject to the limitations provided in section 1298(a) and paragraphs (b)(8)(ii) and (b)(8)(iii) of this section, this paragraph applies by successively considering a person as actually owning its proportionate share of stock or other equity interest directly held by an entity directly owned by the person. Paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section applies after the other subparagraphs of paragraph (b)(8) of this section.

)
Facts.
A is a United States person who owns 49% of the stock of FC1, a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC, and separately all of the stock of DC, a domestic corporation that is not an S corporation. DC, in turn, owns the remaining 51% of the stock of FC1, and FC1 owns 100 shares of stock in a PFIC that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) within the meaning of section 957(a). The remainder of the PFIC's shares are owned by unrelated foreign persons.

Treatment of DC.
Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, DC is considered to actually own 51 shares of the PFIC stock directly held by FC1 because DC directly owns 50% or more of the stock of FC1.
(
ii
)
Treatment of A.
In determining whether A is considered to own 50% or more of the value of FC1 for purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(A) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section to the PFIC stock held through FC1, A is considered under paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
1
) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section as indirectly owning all the stock of FC1 that DC directly owns, before the application of paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section. Because A also directly owns 49% of the stock of FC1, before the application of paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
2
) of
this section A would be treated as owning all 100 shares of PFIC stock held by FC1. However, because 51 shares of the PFIC stock held by FC1 are indirectly owned by DC under paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, pursuant to the limitation imposed by paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, only the remaining 49 shares of the PFIC stock are considered as indirectly owned by A under paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
(B)

)
Facts.
B, a United States citizen, owns 50% of the interests in Foreign Partnership, a foreign partnership treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the remaining interests in which are owned by an unrelated foreign person. Foreign Partnership owns 100% of the stock of FC1 and 50% of the stock of FC2, the remainder of which is owned by an unrelated foreign person. Both FC1 and FC2 are foreign corporations that are not PFICs. FC1 and FC2 each own 50% of the stock of FC3, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC.

)
Results.
Under paragraphs (b)(8)(iii)(A) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for purposes of determining whether B is a shareholder of FC3, B is considered to actually own 50% (50% × 100%) of the stock of FC1 and 25% (50% × 50%) of the stock of FC2. Under paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(A) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, B is then considered to own 25% (50% × 100% × 50%) of the stock of FC3 indirectly through FC1, and thus is a shareholder of FC3 for purposes of the PFIC provisions. Because B is considered to own less than 50% of FC2, B is not considered to own any stock of FC3 indirectly through FC2.

Under paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(A) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for purposes of determining whether B is a shareholder of FC3, B is considered to own 32% (40% × 80%) of the stock of FC1 and 20% (40% × 50%) of the stock of FC2. Because B directly owns 20% of FC1, B is considered to actually own 52% (32% + 20%) of the stock of FC1 in total. Under paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(A) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, B is considered to own 26% (52% × 50%) of the stock of FC3 indirectly through FC1, and thus is a shareholder of FC3 for purposes of the PFIC provisions. B is not considered to own any stock of FC3 indirectly through FC2.

§ 1.1291-9
Deemed dividend election.
(a)
Deemed dividend election
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for making the election under section 1291(d)(2)(B) (deemed dividend election). Under that section, a shareholder (as defined in paragraph (j)(3) of this section) of a PFIC that is an unpedigreed QEF may elect to include in income as a dividend the shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the stock held on the qualification date (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section), provided the PFIC is a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) within the meaning of section 957(a) for the taxable year for which the shareholder elects under section 1295 to treat the PFIC as a QEF (section 1295 election). If the shareholder makes the deemed dividend election, the PFIC will become a pedigreed QEF with respect to the shareholder. The deemed dividend is taxed under section 1291 as an excess distribution received on the qualification date. The excess distribution determined under this paragraph (a) is allocated under section 1291(a)(1)(A) only to those days in the shareholder's holding period during which the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the holding period of the PFIC stock with respect to which
the election is made ends on the day before the qualification date. For the definitions of PFIC, QEF, unpedigreed QEF, and pedigreed QEF, see paragraph (j) (1) and (2) of this section.
(2)
Post-1986 earnings and profits defined
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term post-1986 earnings and profits means the undistributed earnings and profits, within the meaning of section 902(c)(1), as of the day before the qualification date, that were accumulated and not distributed in taxable years of the PFIC beginning after 1986 and during which it was a PFIC, but without regard to whether the earnings relate to a period during which the PFIC was a CFC.
(ii)
Pro rata share of post-1986 earnings and profits attributable to shareholder's stock
—(A)
In general.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the stock held by the shareholder on the qualification date is the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC accumulated during any portion of the shareholder's holding period ending at the close of the day before the qualification date and attributable, under the principles of section 1248 and the regulations under that section, to the PFIC stock held on the qualification date.
(B)
Reduction for previously taxed amounts.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC does not include any amount that the shareholder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (in the manner provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) was, pursuant to another provision of the law, previously included in the income of the shareholder, or of another U.S. person if the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock includes the period during which the stock was held by that other U.S. person.
(b)
Who may make the election.
A shareholder of an unpedigreed QEF that is a CFC for the taxable year of the PFIC for which the shareholder makes the section 1295 election may make the deemed dividend election provided the shareholder held stock of that PFIC on the qualification date. A shareholder is treated as holding stock of the PFIC on the qualification date if its holding period with respect to that stock under section 1223 includes the qualification date. A shareholder may make the deemed dividend election without regard to whether the shareholder is a United States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b). A deemed dividend election may be made by a shareholder whose pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the PFIC stock held on the qualification date is zero.
(c)
Time for making the election.
The shareholder makes the deemed dividend election in the shareholder's return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date. If the shareholder and the PFIC have the same taxable year, the shareholder makes the deemed dividend election in either the original return for the taxable year for which the shareholder makes the section 1295 election, or in an amended return for that year. If the shareholder and the PFIC have different taxable years, the deemed dividend election must be made in an amended return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date. If the deemed dividend election is made in an amended return, the amended return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date.
(d)
Manner of making the election
—(1)
In general.
A shareholder makes the deemed dividend election by filing Form 8621 and the attachment to Form 8621 described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section with the return for the taxable year of the shareholder that includes the qualification date, reporting the deemed dividend as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a)(1), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election after the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the taxable year that includes the qualification date must pay additional interest, pursuant to section 6601, on the amount of the underpayment of tax for that year.
(2)
Attachment to Form 8621.
The shareholder must attach a schedule to
Form 8621 that demonstrates the calculation of the shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC that is treated as distributed to the shareholder on the qualification date pursuant to this section. If the shareholder is claiming an exclusion from its pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits for an amount previously included in its income or the income of another U.S. person, the shareholder must include the following information:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. person that previously included an amount in income, the amount previously included in income by each such U.S. person, the provision of the law pursuant to which the amount was previously included in income, and the taxable year or years of inclusion of each amount; and
(ii) A description of the transaction pursuant to which the shareholder acquired, directly or indirectly, the stock of the PFIC from another U.S. person, and the provisions of law pursuant to which the shareholder's holding period includes the period the other U.S. person held the CFC stock.
(e)
Qualification date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the qualification date is the first day of the PFIC's first taxable year as a QEF (first QEF year).
(2)
Elections made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997
—(i)
In general.
The qualification date for deemed dividend elections made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997, is the first day of the shareholder's election year. The shareholder's election year is the taxable year of the shareholder for which it made the section 1295 election.
(ii)
Exception.
A shareholder who made the deemed dividend election after May 1, 1992, and before January 27, 1997, may elect to change its qualification date to the first day of the first QEF year, provided the periods of limitations on assessment for the taxable year that includes that date and for the shareholder's election year have not expired. A shareholder changes the qualification date by filing amended returns, with revised Forms 8621 and the attachments described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for the shareholder's election year and the shareholder's taxable year that includes the first day of the first QEF year, and making all appropriate adjustments and payments.
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
Eligibility to make deemed dividend election.
A is a U.S. person who files its income tax return on a calendar year basis. On January 2, 1994, A purchased one percent of the stock of M, a PFIC with a taxable year ending November 30. M was both a CFC and a PFIC, but not a QEF, for all of its taxable years. On December 3, 1996, M made a distribution to its shareholders. A received $100, all of which A reported in its 1996 return as an excess distribution as provided in section 1291(a)(1). A decides to make the section 1295 election in A's 1997 taxable year to treat M as a QEF effective for M's taxable year beginning December 1, 1996. Because A did not make the section 1295 election in 1994, the first year in its holding period of M stock that M qualified as a PFIC, M would be an unpedigreed QEF and A would be subject to both sections 1291 and 1293. A, however, may elect under section 1291(d)(2) to purge the years M was not a QEF from A's holding period. If A makes the section 1291(d)(2) election, the December 3 distribution will not be taxable under section 1291(a). Because M is a CFC, even though A is not a U.S. shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b), A may make the deemed dividend election under section 1291(d)(2)(B).
(ii)
Making the election.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the qualification date, and therefore the date of the deemed dividend, is December 1, 1996. Accordingly, to make the deemed dividend election, A must file an amended return for 1996, and include the deemed dividend in income in that year. As a result, M will be a pedigreed QEF as of December 1, 1996, and the December 3, 1996, distribution will not be taxable as an excess distribution. Therefore, in its amended return, A may report the December 3, 1996, distribution consistent with section 1293 and the general rules applicable to corporate distributions.

# Example 2.
X, a U.S. person, owned a five percent interest in the stock of FC, a PFIC with a taxable year ending June 30. X never made the section 1295 election with respect to FC. X transferred her interest in FC to her granddaughter, Y, a U.S. person, on February 14, 1996. The transfer qualified as a gift for Federal income tax purposes, and no gain was recognized on the transfer (see Regulation Project INTL-656-87, published in 1992-1 C.B. 1124; see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). As provided in section 1223(2), Y's holding period includes the period that X held
the FC stock. Y decides to make the section 1295 election in her 1996 return to treat FC as a QEF for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1995. However, because Y's holding period includes the period that X held the FC stock, and FC was a PFIC but not a QEF during that period, FC will be an unpedigreed QEF with respect to Y unless Y makes a section 1291(d)(2) election. Although Y did not actually own the stock of FC on the qualification date (July 1, 1995), Y's holding period includes that date. Therefore, provided FC is a CFC for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1995, Y may make a section 1291(d)(2)(B) election to treat FC as a pedigreed QEF.
(f)
Adjustment to basis.
