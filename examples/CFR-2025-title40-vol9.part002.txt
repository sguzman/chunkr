15th Edition, Method 303F, or, optionally using note no. 2 at the end of this section. Set up the calibration curve (zero to 1000 ng) as described in Method 7470 or similar to Method 303F using 300-ml BOD bottles instead of Erlenmeyers. Perform the following for each Hg analysis. From each original sample, select and record an aliquot in the size range from 1 ml to 10 ml. If no prior knowledge of the expected amount of Hg in the sample exists, a 5 ml aliquot is suggested for the first dilution to 100 ml (see note no. 1 at end of this section). The total amount of Hg in the aliquot shall be less than 1 µg and within the range (zero to 1000 ng) of the calibration curve. Place the sample aliquot into a separate 300-ml BOD bottle, and add enough water to make a total volume of 100 ml. Next add to it sequentially the sample digestion solutions and perform the sample preparation described in the procedures of Method 7470 or Method 303F. (See note no. 2 at the end of this section). If the maximum readings are off-scale (because Hg in the aliquot exceeded the calibration range; including the situation where only a 1-ml aliquot of the original sample was digested), then dilute the original sample (or a portion of it) with 0.15 percent HNO
3
(1.5 ml concentrated HNO
3
per liter aqueous solution) so that when a 1- to 10-ml aliquot of the “0.15 HNO
3
percent dilution of the original sample” is digested and analyzed by the procedures described above, it will yield an analysis within the range of the calibration curve.

# Note No. 1:
When Hg levels in the sample fractions are below the in-stack detection limit given in Table 29-1, select a 10 ml aliquot for digestion and analysis as described.

# Note No. 2:
Optionally, Hg can be analyzed by using the CVAAS analytical procedures given by some instrument manufacturer's directions. These include calibration and quality control procedures for the Leeman Model PS200, the Perkin Elmer FIAS systems, and similar models, if available, of other instrument manufacturers. For digestion and analyses by these instruments, perform the following two steps: (1), Digest the sample aliquot through the addition of the aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride/sodium chloride solution the same as described in this section: (
The Leeman, Perkin Elmer, and similar instruments described in this note add automatically the necessary stannous chloride solution during the automated analysis of Hg.)
; (2), Upon completion of the digestion described in (1), analyze the sample according to the instrument manufacturer's directions. This approach allows multiple (including duplicate) automated analyses of a digested sample aliquot.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Range. For the analysis described and for similar analyses, the ICAP response is linear over several orders of magnitude. Samples containing metal concentrations in the nanograms per ml (ng/ml) to micrograms per ml (µg/ml) range in the final analytical solution can be analyzed using this method. Samples containing greater than approximately 50 µg/ml As, Cr, or Pb should be diluted to that level or lower for final analysis. Samples containing greater than approximately 20 µg/ml of Cd should be diluted to that level before analysis.
13.2 Analytical Detection Limits.

# Note:
See section 13.3 for the description of in-stack detection limits.
13.2.1 ICAP analytical detection limits for the sample solutions (based on
SW-846,
Method 6010) are approximately as follows: Sb (32 ng/ml), As (53 ng/ml), Ba (2 ng/ml), Be (0.3 ng/ml), Cd (4 ng/ml), Cr (7 ng/ml), Co (7 ng/ml), Cu (6 ng/ml), Pb (42 ng/ml), Mn (2 ng/ml), Ni (15 ng/ml), P (75 ng/ml), Se (75 ng/ml), Ag (7 ng/ml), Tl (40 ng/ml), and Zn (2 ng/ml). ICP-MS analytical detection limits (based on
SW-846,
Method 6020) are lower generally by a factor of ten or more. Be is lower by a factor of three. The actual sample analytical detection limits are sample dependent and may vary due to the sample matrix.
13.2.2 The analytical detection limits for analysis by direct aspiration AAS (based on
SW-846
, Method 7000 series) are approximately as follows: Sb (200 ng/ml), As (2 ng/ml), Ba (100 ng/ml), Be (5 ng/ml), Cd (5 ng/ml), Cr (50 ng/ml), Co (50 ng/ml), Cu (20 ng/ml), Pb (100 ng/ml), Mn (10 ng/ml), Ni (40 ng/ml), Se (2 ng/ml), Ag (10 ng/ml), Tl (100 ng/ml), and Zn (5 ng/ml).
13.2.3 The detection limit for Hg by CVAAS (on the resultant volume of the
digestion
of the aliquots taken for Hg analyses) can be approximately 0.02 to 0.2 ng/ml, depending upon the type of CVAAS analytical instrument used. 13.2.4 The use of GFAAS can enhance the detection limits compared to direct aspiration AAS as follows: Sb (3 ng/ml), As (1 ng/ml), Be (0.2 ng/ml), Cd (0.1 ng/ml), Cr (1 ng/ml), Co (1 ng/ml), Pb (1 ng/ml), Se (2 ng/ml), and Tl (1 ng/ml).
13.3 In-stack Detection Limits.
13.3.1 For test planning purposes in-stack detection limits can be developed by using the following information: (1) The procedures described in this method, (2) the analytical detection limits described in section 13.2 and in
SW-846,
(3) the normal volumes of 300 ml (Analytical Fraction 1) for the front-half and 150 ml (Analytical Fraction 2A) for the back-half samples, and (4) a stack gas sample volume of 1.25 m
3
. The resultant in-stack method detection limits for the above set of conditions are presented in Table 29-1 and were calculated by using Eq. 29-1 shown in section 12.5.
13.3.2 To ensure optimum precision/resolution in the analyses, the target concentrations of metals in the analytical solutions should be at least ten times their respective analytical detection limits. Under certain conditions, and with greater care in the analytical procedure, these concentrations can be as low as approximately three times the respective analytical detection limits without seriously impairing the precision of the analyses. On at least one sample run in the source test, and for each metal analyzed, perform either repetitive analyses, Method of Standard Additions, serial dilution, or matrix spike addition, etc., to document the quality of the data.
13.3.3 Actual in-stack method detection limits are based on actual source sampling parameters and analytical results as described above. If required, the method in-stack detection limits can be improved over those shown in Table 29-1 for a specific test by either increasing the sampled stack gas volume, reducing the total volume of the digested samples, improving the analytical detection limits, or any combination of the three. For extremely low levels of
Hg only,
the aliquot size selected for digestion and analysis can be increased to as much as 10 ml, thus improving the in-stack detection limit by a factor of ten compared to a 1 ml aliquot size.
13.3.3.1 A nominal one hour sampling run will collect a stack gas sampling volume of about 1.25 m
3
. If the sampling time is increased to four hours and 5 m
3
are collected, the in-stack method detection limits would be improved by a factor of four compared to the values shown in Table 29-1.
13.3.3.2 The in-stack detection limits assume that all of the sample is digested and the final liquid volumes for analysis are the normal values of 300 ml for Analytical Fraction 1, and 150 ml for Analytical Fraction 2A. If the volume of Analytical Fraction 1 is reduced from 300 to 30 ml, the in-stack detection limits for that fraction of the sample would be improved by a factor of ten. If the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A is reduced from 150 to 25 ml, the in-stack detection limits for that fraction of the sample would be improved by a factor of six. Matrix effect checks are necessary on sample analyses and typically are of much greater significance for samples that have been concentrated to
less than the normal original sample volume. Reduction of Analytical Fractions 1 and 2A to volumes of less than 30 and 25 ml, respectively, could interfere with the redissolving of the residue and could increase interference by other compounds to an intolerable level.
13.3.3.3 When both of the modifications described in sections 13.3.3.1 and 13.3.3.2 are used simultaneously on one sample, the resultant improvements are multiplicative. For example, an increase in stack gas volume by a factor of four and a reduction in the total liquid sample digested volume of both Analytical Fractions 1 and 2A by a factor of six would result in an improvement by a factor of twenty-four of the in-stack method detection limit.
13.4 Precision. The precision (relative standard deviation) for each metal detected in a method development test performed at a sewage sludge incinerator were found to be as follows:
Sb (12.7 percent), As (13.5 percent), Ba (20.6 percent), Cd (11.5 percent), Cr (11.2 percent), Cu (11.5 percent), Pb (11.6 percent), P (14.6 percent), Se (15.3 percent), Tl (12.3 percent), and Zn (11.8 percent). The precision for Ni was 7.7 percent for another test conducted at a source simulator. Be, Mn, and Ag were not detected in the tests. However, based on the analytical detection limits of the ICAP for these metals, their precisions could be similar to those for the other metals when detected at similar levels.

# Method 30A—Determination of Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions From Stationary Sources (Instrumental Analyzer Procedure)

# 1.0 Scope and Application

# What Is Method 30A?
Method 30A is a procedure for measuring total vapor phase mercury (Hg) emissions from stationary sources using an instrumental analyzer. This method is particularly appropriate for performing emissions testing and for conducting relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) of mercury continuous emissions monitoring systems (Hg CEMS) and sorbent trap monitoring systems at coal-fired combustion sources. Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect
data of known and acceptable quality for each testing site. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling procedures and analytical procedures you will need but refers to other test methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional methods which are also found in appendices A-1 and A-3 to this part:
(a) Method 1—Sample and Velocity Traverses for Stationary Sources.
(b) Method 4—Determination of Moisture Content in Stack Gases.
1.1 Analytes. What does this method determine? This method is designed to measure the mass concentration of total vapor phase Hg in flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg
0
) and oxidized forms of Hg (Hg
+2
), in mass concentration units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3
).

1.2 Applicability. When is this method required? Method 30A is offered as a reference method for emission testing and for RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems at coal-fired boilers. Method 30A may also be specified for other source categories in the future, either by New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), emissions trading programs, State Implementation Plans (SIP), or operating permits that require measurement of Hg concentrations in stationary source emissions to determine compliance with an applicable emission standard or limit, or to conduct RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO). How good must my collected data be? Method 30A has been designed to provide data of high and known quality for Hg emission testing and for relative accuracy testing of Hg monitoring systems including Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems. In these and other applications, the principle objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emission levels encountered. To meet this objective, calibration standards prepared according to an EPA traceability protocol must be used and measurement system performance tests are required.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
In this method, a sample of the effluent gas is continuously extracted and conveyed to an analyzer capable of measuring the total vapor phase Hg concentration. Elemental and oxidized mercury (i.e., Hg
0
and Hg
+2
) may be measured separately or simultaneously but, for purposes of this method, total vapor phase Hg is the sum of Hg
0
and Hg
+2
. You must meet the performance requirements of this method (i.e., system calibration, interference testing, dynamic spiking, and system integrity/drift checks) to validate your data. The dynamic spiking requirement is deferred until January 1, 2009.

# 5.0 Safety

# What safety measures should I consider when using this method?
This method may require you to work with hazardous materials and in hazardous conditions. You are encouraged to establish safety procedures before using the method. Among other precautions, you should become familiar with the safety recommendations in the gas analyzer user's manual. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations concerning use of compressed gas cylinders and noxious gases may apply.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 What do I need for the measurement system? This method is intended to be applicable to multiple instrumental technologies. You may use any equipment and supplies that meet the following specifications.
6.1.1 All wetted sampling system components, including probe components prior to the point at which the calibration gas is introduced, must be chemically inert to all Hg species. Materials such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) Teflon
TM
, quartz, treated stainless steel (SS) are examples of such materials. [
Note:
These materials of construction are required because components prior to the calibration gas injection point are not included in the system calibration error, system integrity, and interference tests.]
6.1.2 The interference, system calibration error, system integrity, drift and dynamic spiking test criteria must all be met by the system used.
6.1.3 The system must be capable of measuring and controlling sample flow rate.
6.1.4 All system components prior to the Hg
+2
to Hg
0
converter must be maintained at a sample temperature above the acid gas dew point.
6.2 Measurement System Components. Figure 30A-1 in section 17.0 is an example schematic of a Method 30A measurement system.
6.2.1 Sample Probe. The probe must be made of the appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1, heated when necessary (see section 6.1.4), configured with ports for introduction of calibration and spiking gases, and of sufficient length to traverse all of the sample points.
6.2.2 Filter or Other Particulate Removal Device. The filter or other particulate removal device is considered to be a part of the measurement system, must be made of appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1, and must be included in all system tests.
6.2.3 Sample Line. The sample line that connects the probe to the converter, conditioning system and analyzer must be made of appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1.
6.2.4 Conditioning Equipment. For dry basis measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to remove moisture continuously from the sample gas. Any equipment needed to heat the probe, or sample line to avoid condensation prior to the moisture removal component is also required. For wet basis systems, you must keep the sample above its dew point either by: (1) Heating the sample line and all sample transport components up to the inlet of
the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, also heating the analyzer) or (2) by diluting the sample prior to analysis using a dilution probe system. The components required to do either of the above are considered to be conditioning equipment.
6.2.5 Sampling Pump. A pump is needed to push or pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. If a mechanical sample pump is used and its surfaces are in contact with the sample gas prior to detection, the pump must be leak free and must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled (see section 6.1.1). For dilution-type measurement systems, an ejector pump (eductor) may be used to create a sufficient vacuum that sample gas will be drawn through a critical orifice at a constant rate. The ejector pump may be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled.
6.2.6 Calibration Gas System(s). One or more systems may be needed to introduce calibration gases into the measurement system. A system should be able to flood the sampling probe sufficiently to prevent entry of gas from the effluent stream.
6.2.7 Dynamic Spiking Port. For the purposes of the dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7, the measurement system must be equipped with a port to allow introduction of the dynamic spike gas stream with the sample gas stream, at a point as close as possible to the inlet of the probe so as to ensure adequate mixing. The same port used for system calibrations and calibration error checks may be used for dynamic spiking purposes.
6.2.8 Sample Gas Delivery. The sample line may feed directly to a converter, to a by-pass valve (for speciating systems), or to a sample manifold. All valve and/or manifold components must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled and the calibration gas, and must be configured to safely discharge any excess gas.
6.2.9 Hg Analyzer. An instrument is required that continuously measures the total vapor phase Hg in the gas stream and meets the applicable specifications in section 13.0.
6.2.10 Data Recorder. A recorder, such as a computerized data acquisition and handling system (DAHS), digital recorder, strip chart, or data logger, is required for recording measurement data.
6.3 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured Hg emissions for moisture is required (see section 8.5), either Method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part or other moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator will be needed to measure stack gas moisture content.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Calibration Gases. What calibration gases do I need? You will need calibration gases of known concentrations of Hg
0
and HgCl
2
. Special reagents and equipment may be required to prepare the HgCl
2
gas standards (e.g., a NIST-traceable solution of HgCl
2
and a gas generator equipped with mass flow controllers).
The following calibration gas concentrations are required:
7.1.1 High-Level Gas. Equal to the selected calibration span.
7.1.2 Mid-Level Gas. 40 to 60 percent of the calibration span.
7.1.3 Low-Level Gas. 10 to 30 percent of the calibration span.
7.1.4 Zero Gas. No detectable Hg.
7.1.5 Dynamic Spike Gas. The exact concentration of the HgCl
2
calibration gas used to perform the pre-test dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7 depends on the native Hg concentration in the stack The spike gas must produce a spiked sample concentration above the native concentration, as specified in section 8.2.7.2.2.
7.2 Interference Test. What reagents do I need for the interference test? Use the appropriate test gases listed in Table 30A-3 in section 17.0 (i.e., the potential interferents for the source to be tested, as identified by the instrument manufacturer) to conduct the interference check. These gases need not be of protocol gas quality.

# 8.0 Sample Collection

# Emission Test Procedure
Figure 30A-2 in section 17.0 presents an overview of the test procedures required by this method. Since you may choose different options to comply with certain performance criteria, you must identify the specific options and associated frequencies you select and document your results in regard to the performance criteria.
8.1 Selection of Sampling Sites and Sampling Points. What sampling site and sampling points do I select?
8.1.1 When this method is used solely for Hg emission testing (e.g., to determine compliance with an emission standard or limit), use twelve sampling points located according to Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Alternatively, you may conduct a stratification test as described in section 8.1.3 to determine the number and location of the sampling points.
8.1.2 When this method is used for relative accuracy testing of a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system, follow the sampling
site selection and sampling point layout procedures for gas monitor RATA testing described in the appropriate performance specification or applicable regulation (e.g., Performance Specification 2, section 8.1.3 of appendix B to this part or section 6.5.6 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter), with one exception. If you elect to perform stratification testing as part of the sampling point selection process, perform the testing in accordance with section 8.1.3 of this method (see also “Summary Table of QA/QC Requirements” in section 9.0).
8.1.3 Determination of Stratification. If you elect to perform stratification testing as part of the sampling point selection process and the test results show your effluent gas stream to be unstratified or minimally stratified, you may be allowed to sample at fewer points or at different points than would otherwise be required.
8.1.3.1 Test Procedure. To test for stratification, use a probe of appropriate length to measure the total vapor phase Hg concentration at twelve traverse points located according to Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Alternatively, for a sampling location where stratification is expected (e.g., after a wet scrubber or at a point where dissimilar gas streams are combined together), if a 12-point Hg stratification test has been previously performed at that location and the results of the test showed the location to be minimally stratified or unstratified according to the criteria in section 8.1.3.2, you may perform an abbreviated 3-point or 6-point Hg stratification test at the points specified in section 6.5.6.2(a) of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter in lieu of performing the 12-point test. Sample for a minimum of twice the system response time (see section 8.2.6) at each traverse point. Calculate the individual point and mean Hg concentrations.
8.1.3.2 Acceptance Criteria and Sampling Point Location.
8.1.3.2.1 If the Hg concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than: (a) ±5 percent of the mean concentration; or (b) ±0.2 µg/m
3
(whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered to be unstratified and you may collect samples from a single point that most closely matches the mean.
8.1.3.2.2 If the 5 percent or 0.2 µg/m
3
criterion in section 8.1.3.2.1 is not met, but the Hg concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than: (a)±10 percent of the mean; or (b)±0.5 µg/m
3
(whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered to be minimally stratified, and you may take samples from three points, provided the points are located on the measurement line exhibiting the highest average Hg concentration during the stratification test. If the stack diameter (or equivalent diameter, for a rectangular stack or duct) is greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 ft), locate the three sampling points at 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. Alternatively, if a RATA required by part 75 of this chapter is being conducted, you may locate the three points at 4.4, 14.6, and 29.6 percent of the duct diameter, in accordance with Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. For stack or duct diameters of 2.4 meters (7.8 ft) or less, locate the three sampling points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line.
8.1.3.2.3 If the gas stream is found to be stratified because the 10 percent or 0.5 µg/m
3
criterion in section 8.1.3.2.2 is not met, then either locate three sampling points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line that exhibited the highest average Hg concentration during the stratification test, or locate twelve traverse points for the test in accordance with Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part; or, if a RATA required by part 75 of this chapter is being conducted, locate six Method 1 points along the measurement line that exhibited the highest average Hg concentration.
8.1.3.3 Temporal Variations. Temporal variations in the source Hg concentration during a stratification test may complicate the determination of stratification. If temporal variations are a concern, you may use the following procedure to normalize the stratification test data. A second Hg measurement system, i.e., either an installed Hg CEMS or another Method 30A system, is required to perform this procedure. Position the sampling probe of the second Hg measurement system at a fixed point in the stack or duct, at least one meter from the stack or duct wall. Then, each time that the Hg concentration is measured at one of the stratification test points, make a concurrent measurement of Hg concentration at the fixed point. Normalize the Hg concentration measured at each traverse point, by multiplying it by the ratio of C
F,avg
to C
F
, where C
F
is the corresponding fixed-point Hg concentration measurement, and C
F,avg
is the average of all of the fixed-point measurements over the duration of the stratification test. Evaluate the results of the stratification test according to section 8.1.3.2, using the normalized Hg concentrations.
8.1.3.4 Stratification Testing Exemption. Stratification testing need not be performed at a test location where it would otherwise be required to justify using fewer sample points or different sample points, if the owner or operator documents that the Hg concentration in the stack gas is expected to be 3 µg/m
3
or less at the time of a Hg monitoring system RATA or an Hg emissions test. To demonstrate that a particular test location qualifies for the stratification testing exemption, representative Hg emissions data must be collected just prior to the RATA or
emissions test. At least one hour of Hg concentration data is required for the demonstration. The data used for the demonstration shall be recorded at process operating conditions that closely approximate the operating conditions that will exist during the RATA or emissions test. It is recommended that collection of the demonstration data be integrated with the on-site pretest procedures required by the reference method being used for the RATA or emissions test (whether this method or another approved Hg reference method is used). Quality-assured data from an installed Hg monitoring system may also be used for the demonstration. If a particular test location qualifies for the stratification testing exemption, sampling shall be performed at three points, as described in section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method. The owner or operator shall fully document the method used to collect the demonstration data and shall keep this documentation on file with the data from the associated RATA or Hg emissions test.
8.1.3.5 Interim Alternative Stratification Test Procedures. In the time period between the effective date of this method and January 1, 2009, you may follow one of the following two procedures. Substitute a stratification test for sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) for the Hg stratification test described in section 8.1.3.1. If this option is chosen, follow the test procedures in section 6.5.6.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. Evaluate the test results and determine the sampling point locations according to section 6.5.6.3 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. If the sampling location is found to be minimally stratified or unstratified for SO
2
, it shall be considered minimally stratified or unstratified for Hg. Alternatively, you may forgo stratification testing, assume the gas stream is minimally stratified, and sample at three points as described in section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method.
8.2 Initial Measurement System Performance Tests. What initial performance criteria must my system meet before I begin sampling? Before measuring emissions, perform the following procedures:
(a) Interference Test;
(b) Calibration Gas Verification;
(c) Measurement System Preparation;
(d) 3-Point System Calibration Error Test;
(e) System Integrity Check;
(f) Measurement System Response Time Test; and
(g) Dynamic Spiking Test.
8.2.1 Interference Test (Optional). Your measurement system should be free of known interferences. It is recommended that you conduct this interference test of your measurement system prior to its initial use in the field to verify that the candidate test instrument is free from inherent biases or interferences resulting from common combustion emission constituents. If you have multiple measurement systems with components of the same make and model numbers, you need only perform this interference check on one system and you may also rely on an interference test conducted by the manufacturer on a system having components of the same make and model(s) of the system that you use. The interference test procedure is found in section 8.6 of this method.
8.2.2 Calibration Gas Verification. How must I verify the concentrations of my calibration gases?
8.2.2.1 Cylinder Gas Standards. When cylinder gas standards are used for Hg
0
, obtain a certificate from the gas manufacturer and confirm that the documentation includes all information required by an EPA traceability protocol (see section 16). Confirm that the manufacturer certification is complete and current. Ensure that the calibration gas certifications have not expired.
8.2.2.2 Other Calibration Standards. All other calibration standards for HgCl
2
and Hg
0
, such as gas generators, must meet the requirements of an EPA traceability protocol (see section 16), and the certification procedures must be fully documented in the test report.
8.2.2.3 Calibration Span. Select the calibration span (i.e., high-level gas concentration) so that the measured source emissions are 10 to 100 percent of the calibration span. This requirement is waived for applications in which the Hg concentrations are consistently below 1 µg/m
3
; however, the calibration span for these low-concentration applications shall not exceed 5 µg/m
3
.
8.2.3 Measurement System Preparation. How do I prepare my measurement system for use? Assemble, prepare, and precondition the measurement system according to your standard operating procedure. Adjust the system to achieve the correct sampling rate or dilution ratio (as applicable). Then, conduct a 3-point system calibration error test using Hg
0
as described in section 8.2.4, an initial system integrity check using HgCl
2
and a zero gas as described in section 8.2.5, and a pre-test dynamic spiking test as described in section 8.2.7.
8.2.4 System Calibration Error Test. Conduct a 3-point system calibration error test before the first test run. Use Hg
0
standards for this test. Introduce the low-, mid-, and high-level calibration gases in any order, in system calibration mode, unless you desire to determine the system response time during this test, in which case, inject the gases such that the high-level injection directly follows the low-level injection. For non-dilution systems, you may adjust the system to maintain the correct flow rate at the analyzer during the test, but you may not make adjustments for any other purpose. For dilution systems, you must operate the measurement system at the appropriate dilution
ratio during all system calibration error checks, and you may make only the adjustments necessary to maintain the proper ratio. After each gas injection, wait until a stable response has been obtained. Record the analyzer's final, stable response to each calibration gas on a form similar to Table 30A-1 in section 17.0. For each calibration gas, calculate the system calibration error using Equation 30A-1 in section 12.2. The calibration error specification in section 13.1 must be met for the low-, mid-, and high-level gases. If the calibration error specification is not met for all three gases, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-point calibration is achieved.
8.2.5 System Integrity Check. Perform a two-point system integrity check before the first test run. Use the zero gas and either the mid- or high-level HgCl
2
calibration gas for the check, whichever one best represents the total vapor phase Hg concentration levels in the stack. Record the data on a form similar to Table 30A-2 in section 17.0. The system integrity check specification in section 13.2 must be met for both the zero gas and the mid- or high-level gas. If the system integrity specification is not met for both gases, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable system integrity check is achieved.
8.2.6 Measurement System Response Time. The measurement system response time is used to determine the minimum sampling time for each sampling point and is equal to the time that is required for the measured Hg concentration to increase from the stable low-level calibration gas response to a value within 5 percent of the stable high-level calibration gas response during the system calibration error test in section 8.2.4. Round off the measured system response time to the nearest minute.
8.2.7 Dynamic Spiking Test. You must perform dynamic spiking prior to the first test run to validate your test data. The purpose of this procedure is to demonstrate that the site-specific flue gas matrix does not adversely affect the accuracy of the measurement system. The specifications in section 13.5 must be met to validate your data. If these specifications are not met for the pre-test dynamic spiking, you may not proceed with the test until satisfactory results are obtained. For the time period between the effective date of this method and January 1, 2009, the dynamic spiking requirement is waived.
8.2.7.1 How do I perform dynamic spiking? Dynamic spiking is a gas phase application of the method of standard additions, which involves injecting a known quantity of Hg into the measurement system upstream of all sample conditioning components, similar to system calibration mode, except the probe is not flooded and the resulting sample stream includes both effluent gas and the spike gas. You must follow a written procedure that details how the spike is added to the system, how the spike dilution factor (DF) is measured, and how the Hg concentration data are collected and processed.
8.2.7.2 Spiking Procedure Requirements.
8.2.7.2.1 Spiking Gas Requirements. The spike gas must also be a HgCl
2
calibration gas certified by an EPA traceability protocol. You must choose concentrations that can produce the target levels while being injected at a volumetric flow rate that is ≤20 percent of the total volumetric flow rate through the measurement system (i.e., sample flow rate plus spike gas flow rate).
8.2.7.2.2 Target Spiking Level. The target level for spiking must be 150 to 200 percent of the native Hg concentration; however, if the native Hg concentration is
1 µg/m
3
, set the target level to add between 1 and 4 µg/m
3
Hg
+2
to the native concentration. Use Equation 30A-5 in section 12.5 to calculate the acceptable range of spike gas concentrations at the target level. Then select a spike gas concentration in that range.
8.2.7.2.3 Spike Injections. You must inject spikes in such a manner that the spiking does not alter the total volumetric sample system flow rate and dilution ratio (if applicable). You must collect at least 3 data points, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) specification in section 13.5 must be met. Each data point represents a single spike injection, and pre- and post-injection measurements of the native Hg concentration (or diluted native concentration, as applicable) are required for each spike injection.
8.2.7.2.4 Spike Dilution Factor (DF). For each spike injection, DF, the dilution factor must be determined. DF is the ratio of the total volumetric flow rate of gas through the measurement system to the spike gas flow rate. This factor must be ≥5. The spiking mass balance calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the DF determination. As a result, high accuracy total volumetric flow rate and spike gas flowrate measurements are required. These flow rates may be determined by direct or indirect measurement. Calibrated flow meters, venturies, orifices or tracer gas measurements are examples of potential flow measurement techniques.
8.2.7.2.5 Concentrations. The measurement system must record total vapor phase Hg concentrations continuously during the dynamic spiking procedure. It is possible that dynamic spiking at a level close to 200 percent of the native Hg concentration may cause the measured Hg concentration to exceed the calibration span value. Avoid this by choosing a lower spiking level or by recalibration at a higher span. The measurements shall not exceed 120 percent of the calibration span. The “baseline” measurements made between spikes may represent
the native Hg concentration (if spike gas flow is stopped between injections) or the native Hg concentration diluted by blank or carrier gas flowing at the same rate as the spike gas (if gas flow cannot be stopped between injections). Each baseline measurement must include at least 4 readings or 1 minute (whichever is greater) of stable responses. Use Equation 30A-10 or 30A-11 in section 12.10 (as applicable) to convert baseline measurements to native concentration.
8.2.7.2.6 Recovery. Calculate spike recoveries using Equation 30A-7 in section 12.7. Mass recoveries may be calculated from stable responses based on injected mass flows or from integrated response peaks based on total mass injected. Calculate the mean and RSD for the three (or more) spike injections and compare to the specifications in section 13.5.
8.2.7.2.7 Error Adjustment Option. You may adjust the measurement data collected during dynamic spiking for the system calibration error using Equation 30A-3 in section 12. To do this, perform the initial system integrity check prior to the dynamic spiking test, and perform another system integrity check following the dynamic spiking test and before the first test run. If you choose this option, you must apply Equation 30A-3 to both the spiked sample concentration measurement (C
ss
) and the baseline or native concentration measurement (C
native
), each substituted in place of C
avg
in the equation.
8.2.7.3 Example Spiking Procedure Using a Hot Vapor Calibration Source Generator.
(a) Introduce the spike gas into the probe using a hot vapor calibration source generator and a solution of HgCl
2
in dilute HC1 and HNO

. The calibrator uses a mass flow controller (accurate within 2 percent) to measure the gas flow, and the solution feed is measured using a top-loading balance accurate to 0.01g. The challenges of injecting oxidized Hg may make it impractical to stop the flow of gas between spike injections. In this case, operate the hot vapor calibration source generator continuously during the spiking procedure, swapping blank solutions for HgCl
2
solutions when switching between spiking and baseline measurements.
(b) If applicable, monitor the measurement system to make sure the total sampling system flow rate and the sample dilution ratio do not change during this procedure. Record all data on a data sheet similar to Table 30A-5 in section 17.0. If the Hg measurement system design makes it impractical to measure the total volumetric flow rate through the system, use a spike gas that includes a tracer for measuring the dilution factor, DF (see Equation 30A-9 in section 12.9). Allow the measurements to stabilize between each spike injection, average the pre- and post-injection baseline measurements, and calculate the native concentration. If this measurement shifts by more than 5 percent during any injection, it may be necessary to discard that data point and repeat the injection to achieve the required RSD among the injections. If the spikes persistently show poor repeatability, or if the recoveries are not within the range specified in section 13.5, take corrective action.
8.2.8 Run Validation. How do I confirm that each run I conduct is valid?
8.2.8.1 System Integrity Checks.
(a) Before and after each test run, perform a two-point system integrity check using the same procedure as the initial system integrity check described in section 8.2.5. You may use data from that initial system integrity check as the pre-run data for the first test run, provided it is the most recent system integrity check done before the first run. You may also use the results of a successful post-run system integrity check as the pre-run data for the next test run. Do not make any adjustments to the measurement system during these checks, other than to maintain the target calibration gas flow rate and the proper dilution ratio.
(b) As a time-saving alternative, you may, at the risk of invalidating multiple test runs, skip one or more integrity checks during a test day. Provided there have been no auto-calibrations or other instrument alterations, a single integrity check may suffice as a post-run check to validate (or invalidate) as many consecutive test runs as can be completed during a single test day. All subsequent test days must begin with a pre-run system integrity check subject to the same performance criteria and corrective action requirements as a post-run system integrity check.
(c) Each system integrity check must meet the criteria for system integrity checks in section 13.2. If a post-run system integrity check is failed, all test runs since the last passed system integrity check are invalid. If a post-run or a pre-run system integrity check is failed, you must take corrective action and pass another 3-point Hg
0
system calibration error test (Section 8.2.4) followed by another system integrity check before conducting any additional test runs. Record the results of the pre- and post-run system integrity checks on a form similar to Table 30A-2 in section 17.0.
8.2.8.2 Drift Check. Using the data from the successful pre- and post-run system integrity checks, calculate the zero and upscale drift, using Equation 30A-2 in section 12.3. Exceeding the section 13.3 specification does not invalidate the run, but corrective action must be taken and a new 3-point Hg
0
system calibration error test and a system integrity check must be passed before any more runs are made.
8.3 Dilution-Type Systems—Special Considerations. When a dilution-type measurement system is used, there are three important considerations that must be taken into
account to ensure the quality of the emissions data. First, the critical orifice size and dilution ratio must be selected properly so that the sample dew point will be below the sample line and analyzer temperatures. Second, a high-quality, accurate dilution controller must be used to maintain the correct dilution ratio during sampling. The dilution controller should be capable of monitoring the dilution air pressure, orifice upstream pressure, eductor vacuum, and sample flow rates. Third, differences between the molecular weight of calibration gas mixtures, dilution air, and the stack gas molecular weight must be considered because these can affect the dilution ratio and introduce measurement bias.
8.4 Sampling.
(a) Position the probe at the first sampling point. Allow the system to flush and equilibrate for at least two times the measurement system response time before recording any data. Then, traverse and record measurements at all required sampling points. Sample at each traverse point for an equal length of time, maintaining the appropriate sample flow rate or dilution ratio (as applicable). For all Hg instrumental method systems, the minimum sampling time at each sampling point must be at least two times the system response time, but not less than 10 minutes. For concentrating systems, the minimum sampling time must also include at least 4 concentration measurement cycles.
(b) After recording data for the appropriate period of time at the first traverse point, you may move the sample probe to the next point and continue recording, omitting the requirement to allow the system to equilibrate for two times the system response time before recording data at the subsequent traverse points. You must, however, sample at this and all subsequent traverse points for the required minimum amount of time specified in this section. If you must remove the probe from the stack for any reason, you must again allow the sampling system to equilibrate for at least two times the system response time prior to resuming data recording.
(c) If at any point the measured Hg concentration exceeds the calibration span value, you must at a minimum identify and report this as a deviation from the method. Depending on the data quality objectives of the test, this event may require corrective action before proceeding. If the average Hg concentration for any run exceeds the calibration span value, the run is invalidated.
8.5 Moisture Correction. If the moisture basis (wet or dry) of the measurements made with this method is different from the moisture basis of either: (1) The applicable emission limit; or (2) a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system being evaluated for relative accuracy, you must determine the moisture content of the flue gas and correct the measured gas concentrations to a dry basis using Method 4 in appendix A-3 of this part or other appropriate methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
8.6 Optional Interference Test Procedure.
(a) Select an appropriate calibration span that reflects the source(s) to be tested and perform the interference check at 40 percent of the lowest calibration span value anticipated, e.g., 10 µg/m
3
. Alternatively, successfully conducting the interference test at an absolute Hg concentration of 2 µg/m
3
will demonstrate performance for an equivalent calibration span of 5 µg/m
3
, the lowest calibration span allowed for Method 30A testing. Therefore, performing the interference test at the 2 µ/m
3
level will serve to demonstrate acceptable performance for all calibration spans greater than or equal to 5 µg/m
3
.
(b) Introduce the interference test gases listed in Table 30A-3 in section 17.0 into the measurement system separately or as a mixture. The interference test gases HCl and NO must be introduced as a mixture. The interference test gases must be introduced into the sampling system at the probe such that the interference gas mixtures pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other components as would be configured for normal sampling.
(c) The interference test must be performed using HgCl
2
, and each interference test gas (or gas mixture) must be evaluated in triplicate. This is accomplished by measuring the Hg response first with only the HgCl
2
gas present and then when adding the interference test gas(es) while maintaining the HgCl
2
concentration of the test stream constant. It is important that the equipment used to conduct the interference test be of sufficient quality so as to be capable of blending the HgCl
2
and interference gases while maintaining the Hg concentration constant. Gas blending system or manifolds may be used.
(d) The duration of each test should be for a sufficient period of time to ensure the Hg measurement system surfaces are conditioned and a stable output is obtained. Measure the Hg response of the analyzer to these gases in µg/m3. Record the responses and determine the overall interference response using Table 30A-4 in section 17.0 and the equations presented in section 12.11. The specification in section 13.4 must be met.
(e) A copy of these data, including the date completed and a signed certification, must be included with each test report. The intent of this test is that the interference test results are intended to be valid for the life of the system. As a result, the Hg measurement system should be operated and tested in a configuration consistent with the configuration that will be used for field applications. However, if the system used for field testing is not consistent with the system that was interference-tested, the interference test
must be repeated before it is used for any field applications. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to: major changes in dilution ratio (for dilution based systems), changes in catalyst materials, changes in filtering device design or materials, changes in probe design or configuration, and changes in gas conditioning materials or approaches.

Sample Point Selection
Number and Location of Sample Points
For emission testing applications, use 12 points, located according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part, unless the results of a stratification test allow fewer points to be used
Prior to first run.
For Part 60 RATAs, follow the procedures in Performance Specification 2, section 8.1.3, and for Part 75 RATAs, follow the procedures in section 6.5.6 of appendix A to Part 75. That is:
• At
any
test location, you may use 3 sample points located at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3% of a “long” measurement line passing through the centroidal area; or
• At
any
test location, you may use 6 sample points along a diameter, located according to Method 1 (Part 75 RATAs, only); or
• At a location where stratification is not expected and the measurement line is
2.4 m (7.8 ft), you may use 3 sample points located along a “short” measurement line at 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 m from the stack or duct wall or, for Part 75 only, sample points may be located at 4.4, 14.6, and 29.6% of the measurement line; or
• After a wet scrubber or at a point where dissimilar gas streams are combined, either locate 3 sample points along the “long” measurement line or locate 6 Method 1 points along a diameter (Part 75, only), unless the results of a stratification test allow you to use a “short” 3-point measurement line or to sample at a single point
• If it can be demonstrated that stack gas concentration is ≤3 µg/m
3
, then the test site is exempted from stratification testing. Use the 3-point “short” measurement line if the stack diameter is
2.4 m (7.8 ft) and the 3-point “long” line for stack diameters ≤2.4 m (7.8 ft)

Sample Point Selection
Stratification Test (See section 8.1.3).
If the Hg concentration

at each traverse point during the stratification test is:
• Within ±5% of mean, use 1-point sampling (at the point closest to the mean); or
• Not within ±5% of mean, but is within ±10% of mean, use 3-point sampling. Locate points according to section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method.
Alternatively, if the Hg concentration at each point is:
• Within ±0.2 µg/m
3
of mean, use 1-point sampling (at the point closest to the mean); or
• Not within ±0.2 µg/m
3
of mean, but is within ±0.5 µg/m
3
of mean, use 3-point sampling. Locate points according to section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method.
Prior to first run.
Prior to 1/1/09, you may (1) forgo stratification testing and use 3 sampling points (as per section 8.1.3.2.2) or (2) perform a SO
2
stratification test (see sections 6.5.6.1 and 6.5.6.3 of appendix A to part 75), in lieu of a Hg stratification test. If the test location is unstratified or minimally stratified for SO

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# What measurement system calibrations are required?
Your analyzer must be calibrated with Hg° standards. The initial 3-point system calibration error test described in section 8.2.4 is required before you start the test. Also, prior to and following test runs, the two-point system integrity checks described in sections 8.2.5 and 8.2.8 are required. On and after January 1, 2009, the pre-test dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7 is also required to verify that the accuracy of the measurement system is suitable and not adversely affected by the flue gas matrix.

# Method 30B—Determination of Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions From Coal-Fired Combustion Sources Using Carbon Sorbent Traps

# 1.0 Scope and Application

# What is Method 30B?
Method 30B is a procedure for measuring total vapor phase mercury (Hg) emissions from coal-fired combustion sources using sorbent trap sampling and an extractive or thermal analytical technique. This method is only intended for use only under relatively low particulate conditions (e.g., sampling after all pollution control devices). Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect data of known and acceptable quality for each testing program. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling and analytical procedures you will need, but instead refers to other test methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional methods which are found in Appendices A-1 and A-3 to this part:
(a) Method 1—Sample and Velocity Traverses for Stationary Sources.
(b) Method 4—Determination of Moisture Content in Stack Gases.
(c) Method 5—Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions from Stationary Sources

Method 30B is a reference method for relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) of vapor phase Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems installed at coal-fired boilers and is also appropriate for Hg emissions testing at such boilers. It is intended for use only under relatively low particulate conditions (i.e., sampling after all pollution control devices); in cases where significant amounts of particle-bound Hg may be present, an isokinetic sampling method for Hg should be used. Method 30B may also be specified by New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), emissions trading programs, State Implementation Plans (SIPs), and operating permits that require measurement of Hg concentrations in stationary source emissions, either to determine compliance with an applicable emission standard or limit, or to conduct RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO). How good must my collected data be? Method 30B has been designed to provide data of high and known quality for Hg emissions testing and for RATA testing of Hg monitoring systems, including CEMS and sorbent trap monitors. In these and other applications, the principal objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emissions levels and in the actual emissions matrix encountered. To meet this objective, NIST-traceable calibration standards must be used and method performance tests are required.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
Known volumes of flue gas are extracted from a stack or duct through paired, in-stack sorbent media traps at an appropriate flow rate. Collection of mercury on the sorbent media in the stack mitigates potential loss of mercury during transport through a probe/sample line. For each test run, paired train sampling is required to determine measurement precision and verify acceptability of the measured emissions data. A field recovery test which assesses recovery of an elemental Hg spike to determine measurement bias is also used to verify data acceptability. The sorbent traps are recovered from the sampling system, prepared for analysis as needed, and analyzed by any suitable determinative technique that can meet the performance criteria.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
The following list is presented as an example of key equipment and supplies likely required to measure vapor-phase Hg using a sorbent trap sampling system. It is recognized that additional equipment and supplies may be needed. Collection of paired samples is required.
6.1 Sorbent Trap Sampling System. A typical sorbent trap sampling system is shown in Figure 30B-1 in section 17.0. The sorbent trap sampling system shall include the following components:
6.1.1 Sorbent Traps. The sorbent media used to collect Hg must be configured in a trap with at least two distinct segments or sections, connected in series, that are amenable to separate analyses. section 1 is designated for primary capture of gaseous Hg. section 2 is designated as a backup section for determination of vapor phase Hg breakthrough. Each sorbent trap must be inscribed or otherwise permanently marked with a unique identification number, for tracking purposes. The sorbent media may be any collection material (e.g., carbon, chemically-treated filter, etc.) capable of quantitatively capturing and recovering for subsequent analysis, all gaseous forms of Hg in the emissions from the intended application. Selection of the sorbent media shall be based on the material's ability to achieve the performance criteria contained in this method as well as the sorbent's vapor phase
Hg capture efficiency for the emissions matrix and the expected sampling duration at the test site. The sorbent media must be obtained from a source that can demonstrate their quality assurance and quality control (see section 7.2). The paired sorbent traps are supported on a probe (or probes) and inserted directly into the flue gas stream.
6.1.2 Sampling Probe Assembly. Each probe assembly shall have a leak-free attachment to the sorbent trap(s). Each sorbent trap must be mounted at the entrance of or within the probe such that the gas sampled enters the trap directly. Each probe/sorbent trap assembly must be heated to a temperature sufficient to prevent liquid condensation in the sorbent trap(s). Auxiliary heating is required only where the stack temperature is too low to prevent condensation. Use a calibrated thermocouple to monitor the stack temperature. A single probe capable of operating the paired sorbent traps may be used. Alternatively, individual probe/sorbent trap assemblies may be used, provided that the individual sorbent traps are co-located to ensure representative Hg monitoring.
6.1.3 Moisture Removal Device. A moisture removal device or system shall be used to remove water vapor from the gas stream prior to entering dry gas flow metering devices.
6.1.4 Vacuum Pump. Use a leak-tight, vacuum pump capable of operating within the system's flow range.
6.1.5 Gas Flow Meter. A gas flow meter (such as a dry gas meter, thermal mass flow meter, or other suitable measurement device) shall be used to determine the total sample volume on a dry basis, in units of standard cubic meters. The meter must be sufficiently accurate to measure the total sample volume to within 2 percent and must be calibrated at selected flow rates across the range of sample flow rates at which the sampling train will be operated. The gas flow meter shall be equipped with any necessary auxiliary measurement devices (e.g., temperature sensors, pressure measurement devices) needed to correct the sample volume to standard conditions.
6.1.6 Sample Flow Rate Meter and Controller. Use a flow rate indicator and controller for maintaining necessary sampling flow rates.
6.1.7 Temperature Sensor. Same as section 6.1.1.7 of Method 5 in Appendix A-3 to this part.
6.1.8 Barometer. Same as section 6.1.2 of Method 5 in Appendix A-3 to this part.
6.1.9 Data Logger (optional). Device for recording associated and necessary ancillary information (e.g., temperatures, pressures, flow, time, etc.).
6.2 Gaseous Hg
0
Sorbent Trap Spiking System. A known mass of gaseous Hg
0
must be either present on or spiked onto the first section of sorbent traps in order to perform the Hg
0
and HgCl
2
analytical bias test and the field recovery study. Any approach capable of quantitatively delivering known masses of Hg
0
onto sorbent traps is acceptable. Several spiking technologies or devices are available to meet this objective. Their practicality is a function of Hg mass spike levels. For low levels, NIST-certified or NIST-traceable gas generators or tanks may be suitable. An alternative system, capable of delivering almost any mass required, makes use of NIST-certified or NIST-traceable Hg salt solutions (e.g., HgCl
2
, Hg(NO
3
)
2
). With this system, an aliquot of known volume and concentration is added to a reaction vessel containing a reducing agent (e.g., stannous chloride); the Hg salt solution is reduced to Hg
0
and purged onto the sorbent trap using an impinger sparging system. When available, information on example spiking systems will be posted at
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
6.3 Sample Analysis Equipment. Any analytical system capable of quantitatively recovering and quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media selected is acceptable provided that the analysis can meet the performance criteria described in this method. Example recovery techniques include acid leaching, digestion, and thermal desorption/direct combustion. Example analytical techniques include, but are not limited to, ultraviolet atomic fluorescence (UV AF), ultraviolet atomic absorption (UV AA) with and without gold trapping, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis.
6.3 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured Hg emissions for moisture is required (see section 8.3.3.7), either Method 4 in Appendix A-3 to this part or other moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator will be needed to measure stack gas moisture content.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Reagents and Standards. Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable calibration standards, standard reference materials, and reagents shall be used for the tests and procedures required by this method.
7.2 Sorbent Trap Media. The sorbent trap media shall be prepared such that the material used for testing is of known and acceptable quality. Sorbent supplier quality assurance/quality control measures to ensure appropriate and consistent performance such as sorptive capacity, uniformity of preparation treatments, and background levels shall be considered.

# 8.0 Sample Collection and Handling
This section presents the sample collection and handling procedures along with the pretest and on-site performance tests required by this method. Since you may choose different options to comply with certain performance criteria, each test report must identify the specific options selected and
document the results with respect to the performance criteria of this method.
8.1 Selection of Sampling Sites and Sampling Points. What sampling site and sampling points do I select? Same as section 8.1 of Method 30A of this appendix.
8.2 Measurement System Performance Tests. What performance criteria must my measurement system meet? The following laboratory and field procedures and associated criteria of this section are designed to ensure (1) selection of a sorbent and analytical technique combination capable of quantitative collection and analysis of gaseous Hg, (2) collection of an adequate amount of Hg on each sorbent trap during field tests, and (3) adequate performance of the method for each test program: The primary objectives of these performance tests are to characterize and verify the performance of your intended analytical system and associated sampling and analytical procedures, and to define the minimum amount of Hg (as the sample collection target) that can be quantified reliably.
(a) Analytical Matrix Interference Test;
(b) Determination of Minimum Sample Mass;
(c) Hg
0
and HgCl
2
Analytical Bias Test;
(d) Determination of Nominal Sample Volume;
(e) Field Recovery Test.
8.2.1 Analytical Matrix Interference Test and Minimum Sample Dilution.
(a) The analytical matrix interference test is a laboratory procedure. It is required only if you elect to use a liquid digestion analytical approach and needs to be performed only once for each sorbent material used. The purpose of the test is to verify the presence or absence of known and potential analytical matrix interferences, including the potential negative bias associated with iodine common to many sorbent trap materials. The analytical matrix interference test determines the minimum dilution (if any) necessary to mitigate matrix effects on the sample digestate solutions.
(b) The result of the analytical matrix interference test, i.e., the minimum sample dilution required (if any) for all sample analyses, is used to establish the minimum sample mass needed for the Hg
0
and HgCl
2
analytical bias test and to determine the nominal sample volume for a test run. The analytical matrix interference test is sorbent material-specific and shall be performed for each sorbent material you intend to use for field sampling and analysis. The test shall be performed using a mass of sorbent material comparable to the sorbent mass typically used in the first section of the trap for sampling. Similar sorbent materials from different sources of supply are considered to be different materials and must be tested individually. You must conduct the analytical matrix interference test for each sorbent material prior to the analysis of field samples.
8.2.1.1 Analytical Matrix Interference Test Procedures. Digest and prepare for analysis a representative mass of sorbent material (unsampled) according to your intended laboratory techniques for field samples. Analyze the digestate according to your intended analytical conditions at the least diluted level you intend to use for sample analysis (e.g., undiluted, 1 in 10 dilution, etc.). Determine the Hg concentration of the undiluted digestate solution. Prepare a series of solutions with a fixed final volume containing graduated aliquots of the sample digestate and, a fixed aliquot of a calibration standard (with the balance being Hg-free reagent or H
2
0) to establish solutions of varied digestate dilution ratio (e.g., 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100, etc.—see example in section 8.2.1.3, below). One of these solutions should contain only the aliquot of the calibration standard in Hg-free reagent or H
2
O. This will result in a series of solutions where the amount of Hg is held relatively constant and only the volume of digestate diluted is varied. Analyze each of these solutions following intended sample analytical procedures and conditions, determining the concentration for each solution.
8.2.1.2 Analytical Matrix Interference Test Acceptance Criteria. Compare the measured concentration of each solution containing digestate to the measured concentration of the digestate-free solution. The lowest dilution ratio of any solution having a Hg concentration within ±5 percent of the digestate-free solution is the minimum dilution ratio required for analysis of all samples. If you desire to measure the digestate without dilution, the ±5 percent criterion must be met at a dilution ratio of at least 9:10 (i.e., ≥90% digestate).
8.2.1.3 Example Analytical Matrix Interference Test. An example analytical matrix interference test is presented below. Additional information on the conduct of the analytical matrix interference test will be posted at
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
Determine the most sensitive working range for the analyzer to be used. This will be a narrow range of concentrations. Digest and prepare for analysis a representative mass of sorbent material (unsampled) according to your intended laboratory techniques for sample preparation and analysis. Prepare a calibration curve for the most sensitive analytical region, e.g., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10 ppb. Using the highest calibration standard, e.g., 10.0 ppb, prepare a series of solutions by adding successively smaller increments of the digestate to a fixed volume of the calibration standard and bringing each solution to a final fixed volume with mercury-free deionized water (diH
2
O). To 2.0 ml of the calibration standard add 18.0, 10.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2, and 0.0 ml of the digestate. Bring the final volume of each solution to a total volume of
20 ml by adding 0.0, 8.0, 14.0, 16.0, 17.0, 17.8, and 18.0 ml of diH
2
O. This will yield solutions with dilution ratios of 9:10, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:100, and 0:10, respectively. Determine the Hg concentration of each solution. The dilution ratio of any solution having a concentration that is within ±5 percent of the concentration of the solution containing 0.0 ml of digestate is an acceptable dilution ratio for analyzing field samples. If more than one solution meets this criterion, the one with the lowest dilution ratio is the minimum dilution required for analysis of field samples. If the 9:10 dilution meets this criterion, then no sample dilution is required.
8.2.2 Determination of Minimum Sample Mass. The minimum mass of Hg that must be collected per sample must be determined. This information is necessary in order to effectively perform the Hg
0
and HgCl
2
Analytical Bias Test, to estimate target sample volumes/sample times for test runs, and to ensure the quality of the measurements. The determination of minimum sample mass is a direct function of analytical technique, measurement sensitivity, dilutions, etc. This determination is required for all analytical techniques. Based on the analytical approach you employ, you should determine the most sensitive calibration range. Based on a calibration point within that range, you must consider all sample treatments (e.g., dilutions) to determine the mass of sample that needs to be collected to ensure that all sample analyses fall within your calibration curve.
8.2.2.1 Determination of Minimum Calibration Concentration or Mass. Based on your instrument's sensitivity and linearity, determine the calibration concentrations or masses that make up a representative low level calibration range. Verify that you are able to meet the multipoint calibration performance criteria in section 11.0 of this method. Select a calibration concentration or mass that is no less than 2 times the lowest concentration or mass in your calibration curve. The lowest point in your calibration curve must be at least 5, and preferably 10, times the Method Detection Limit (MDL), which is the minimum amount of the analyte that can be detected and reported. The MDL must be determined at least once for the analytical system using an MDL study such as that found in section 15.0 to Method 301 of appendix A to part 63 of this chapter.

# Note to section 8.2.2.1:
While it might be desirable to base the minimum calibration concentration or mass on the lowest point in the calibration curve, selecting a higher concentration or mass is necessary to ensure that all analyses of the field samples will fall within the calibration curve. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you select a minimum calibration concentration or mass that is sufficiently above the lowest point of the calibration curve (see examples in sections 8.2.2.2.1 and 8.2.2.2.2 below).
8.2.2.2 Determination of Minimum Sample Mass. Based on your minimum calibration concentration or mass and other sample treatments including, but not limited to, final digestate volume and minimum sample dilution, determine the minimum sample mass. Consideration should also be given to the Hg levels expected to be measured in section 2 of the sorbent traps and to the breakthrough criteria presented in Table 9-1.
8.2.2.2.1 Example Determination of Minimum Sample Mass for Thermal Desorption Analysis. A thermal analysis system has been calibrated at five Hg mass levels: 10 ng, 20 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 200 ng, and shown to meet the calibration performance criteria in this method. Based on 2 times the lowest point in the calibration curve, 20 ng is selected as the minimum calibration mass. Because the entire sample is analyzed and there are no dilutions involved, the minimum sample mass is also 20 ng.

# Note:
In this example, if the typical background (blank) Hg levels in section 2 were relatively high (e.g., 3 to 5 ng), a sample mass of 20 ng might not have been sufficient to ensure that the breakthrough criteria in Table 9-1 would be met, thereby necessitating the use of a higher point on the calibration curve (e.g., 50 ng) as the minimum calibration and sample mass.
8.2.2.2.2 Example Determination of Minimum Sample Mass for Acid Leachate/Digestate Analysis. A cold vapor analysis system has been calibrated at four Hg concentration levels: 2 ng/L, 5 ng, 10 ng/L, 20 ng/L, and shown to meet the calibration performance criteria in this method. Based on 2 times the lowest point in the calibration curve, 4 ng/L was selected as the minimum calibration concentration. The final sample volume of a digestate is nominally 50 ml (0.05 L) and the minimum dilution necessary was determined to be 1:100 by the Analytical Matrix Interference Test of section 8.2.1. The following calculation would be used to determine the minimum sample mass.
Minimum sample mass = (4 ng/L) × (0.05 L) × (100) = 20 ng

# Note:
In this example, if the typical background (blank) Hg levels in section 2 were relatively high (e.g., 3 to 5 ng), a sample mass of 20 ng might not have been sufficient to ensure that the breakthrough criterion in Table 9-1 would be met, thereby necessitating the use of a higher point on the calibration curve (e.g., 10 ng/L) as the minimum calibration concentration.
8.2.3 Hg
0
and HgCl
2
Analytical Bias Test. Before analyzing any field samples, the laboratory must demonstrate the ability to recover and accurately quantify Hg
0
and HgCl
2
from the chosen sorbent media by performing the following analytical bias test for sorbent traps spiked with Hg
0
and HgCl
2
. The analytical bias test is performed at a minimum of two distinct sorbent trap Hg loadings that will: (1) Represent the lower and upper bound of sample Hg loadings for application of the analytical technique to the field samples, and (2) be used for data validation.
8.2.3.1 Hg
0
and HgCl
2
Analytical Bias Test Procedures. Determine the lower and upper bound mass loadings. The minimum sample mass established in section 8.2.2.2 can be used for the lower bound Hg mass loading although lower Hg loading levels are acceptable. The upper bound Hg loading level should be an estimate of the greatest mass loading that may result as a function of stack concentration and volume sampled. As previously noted, this test defines the bounds that actual field samples must be within in order to be valid.
8.2.3.1.1 Hg
0
Analytical Bias Test. Analyze the front section of three sorbent traps containing Hg
0
at the lower bound mass loading level and the front section of three sorbent traps containing Hg
0
at the upper bound mass loading level. In other words, analyze each mass loading level in triplicate. You may refer to section 6.2 for spiking guidance. Prepare and analyze each spiked trap, using the same techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for the three traps at each mass loading level must be between 90 and 110 percent. If multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate analytical bias test is required for each sorbent material.
8.2.3.1.2 HgCl
2
Analytical Bias Test. Analyze the front section of three sorbent traps containing HgCl
2
at the lower bound mass loading level and the front section of three traps containing HgCl
2
at the upper bound mass loading level. HgCl
2
can be spiked as a gas, or as a liquid solution containing HgCl
2
. However the liquid volume spiked must be
100 µL. Prepare and analyze each spiked trap, using the techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for three traps at each spike concentration must be between 90 and 110 percent. Again, if multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate analytical bias test is required for each sorbent material.
8.2.4 Determination of Target Sample Volume. The target sample volume is an estimate of the sample volume needed to ensure that valid emissions data are collected (i.e., that sample mass Hg loadings fall within the analytical calibration curve and are within the upper and lower bounds set by the analytical bias tests). The target sample volume and minimum sample mass can also be determined by performing a diagnostic test run prior to initiation of formal testing.

# Example:
If the minimum sample mass is 50 ng and the concentration of mercury in the stack gas is estimated to be 2 µg/m
3
(ng/L) then the following calculation would be used to determine the target sample volume:
Target Sample Volume = (50 ng) / (2 ng/L) = 25 L

# Note to section 8.2.4:
For the purposes of relative accuracy testing of Hg monitoring systems under subpart UUUUU of part 63 of this chapter and Performance Specifications 12A and 12B in appendix B to this part, when the stack gas Hg concentration is expected to be very low (
0.5 µg/dscm), you may estimate the Hg concentration at 0.5 µg/dscm.
8.2.5 Determination of Sample Run Time. Sample run time will be a function of minimum sample mass (see section 8.2.2), target sample volume and nominal equipment sample flow rate. The minimum sample run time for conducting relative accuracy test audits of Hg monitoring systems is 30 minutes and for emissions testing to characterize an emission source is 1 hour. The target sample run time can be calculated using the following example.

# Example:
If the target sample volume has been determined to be 25 L, then the following formula would be used to determine the sampling time necessary to acquire 25 L of gas when sampling at a rate of 0.4 L/min.
Sampling time (min) = 25 L / 0.4 L/min = 63 minutes
8.2.6 Field Recovery Test. The field recovery test provides a test program-specific verification of the performance of the combined sampling and analytical approach. Three sets of paired samples, one of each pair which is spiked with a known level of Hg, are collected and analyzed and the average recovery of the spiked samples is used to verify performance of the measurement system under field conditions during that test program. The conduct of this test requires an estimate or confirmation of the stack Hg concentrations at the time of testing.
8.2.6.1 Calculation of Pre-sampling Spiking Level. Determine the sorbent trap spiking level for the field recovery test using estimates of the stack Hg concentration, the target sample flow rate, and the planned sample duration. First, determine the Hg mass expected to be collected in section 1 of the sorbent trap. The pre-sampling spike must be within 50 to 150 percent of this expected mass.

# Example calculation:
For an expected stack Hg concentration of 5 ug/m
3
(ng/L) a target sample rate of 0.40 liters/min, and a sample duration of 1 hour:
(0.40 L/min) * (60 min) * (5ng/L) = 120 ng
A Hg spike of 60 to 180 ng (50-150% of 120 ng) would be appropriate.
8.2.6.2 Procedures. Set up two identical sampling trains. One of the sampling trains
shall be designated the spiked train and the other the unspiked train. Spike Hg
0
onto the front section of the sorbent trap in the spiked train before sampling. The mass of Hg spiked shall be 50 to 150 percent of the mass expected to be collected with the unspiked train. Sample the stack gas with the two trains simultaneously using the same procedures as for the field samples (see section 8.3). The total sample volume must be within ±20 percent of the target sample volume for the field sample test runs. Analyze the sorbent traps from the two trains utilizing the same analytical procedures and instrumentation as for the field samples (see section 11.0). Determine the fraction of spiked Hg recovered (R) using the equations in section 12.7. Repeat this procedure for a total of three runs. Report the individual R values in the test report; the average of the three R values must be between 85 and 115 percent.

# Note to section 8.2.6.2:
It is acceptable to perform the field recovery test concurrent with actual test runs (e.g., through the use of a quad probe). It is also acceptable to use the field recovery test runs as test runs for emissions testing or for the RATA of a Hg monitoring system under subpart UUUUU of part 63 of this chapter and Performance Specifications 12A and 12B in appendix B to this part, if certain conditions are met. To determine whether a particular field recovery test run may be used as a RATA run, subtract the mass of the Hg
0
spike from the total Hg mass collected in sections 1 and 2 of the spiked trap. The difference represents the mass of Hg in the stack gas sample. Divide this mass by the sample volume to obtain the Hg concentration in the effluent gas stream, as measured with the spiked trap. Compare this concentration to the corresponding Hg concentration measured with the unspiked trap. If the paired trains meet the relative deviation and other applicable data validation criteria in Table 9-1, then the average of the two Hg concentrations may be used as an emissions test run value or as the reference method value for a RATA run.
8.3 Sampling. This section describes the procedures and criteria for collecting the field samples for analysis. As noted in section 8.2.6, the field recovery test samples are also collected using these procedures.
8.3.1 Pre-test leak check. Perform a leak check of the sampling system with the sorbent traps in place. For each of the paired sampling trains, draw a vacuum in the train, and adjust the vacuum to ~15″ Hg; and, using the gas flow meter, determine leak rate. The leak rate for an individual train must not exceed 4 percent of the target sampling rate. Once the leak check passes this criterion, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train, then seal the sorbent trap inlet until the probe is ready for insertion into the stack or duct.
8.3.2 Determination of Flue Gas Characteristics. Determine or measure the flue gas measurement environment characteristics (gas temperature, static pressure, gas velocity, stack moisture, etc.) in order to determine ancillary requirements such as probe heating requirements (if any), initial sampling rate, moisture management, etc.
8.3.3 Sample Collection
8.3.3.1 Remove the plug from the end of each sorbent trap and store each plug in a clean sorbent trap storage container. Remove the stack or duct port cap and insert the probe(s). Secure the probe(s) and ensure that no leakage occurs between the duct and environment.
8.3.3.2 Record initial data including the sorbent trap ID, date, and the run start time.
8.3.3.3 Record the initial gas flow meter reading, stack temperature, meter temperatures (if needed), and any other appropriate information, before beginning sampling. Begin sampling and target a sampling flow rate similar to that for the field recovery test. Then, at regular intervals (≤5 minutes) during the sampling period, record the date and time, the sample flow rate, the gas meter reading, the stack temperature, the flow meter temperatures (if using a dry gas meter), temperatures of heated equipment such as the vacuum lines and the probes (if heated), and the sampling system vacuum readings. Adjust the sampling flow rate as necessary to maintain the initial sample flow rate. Ensure that the total volume sampled for each run is within 20 percent of the total volume sampled for the field recovery test.
8.3.3.4 Data Recording. Obtain and record any essential operating data for the facility during the test period, e.g., the barometric pressure must be obtained for correcting sample volume to standard conditions when using a dry gas meter. At the end of the data collection period, record the final gas flow meter reading and the final values of all other essential parameters.
8.3.3.5 Post-Test Leak Check. When sampling is completed, turn off the sample pump, remove the probe(s) with sorbent traps from the port, and carefully seal the end of each sorbent trap. Perform another leak check of each sampling train with the sorbent trap in place, at the maximum vacuum reached during the sampling period. Record the leakage rates and vacuums. The leakage rate for each train must not exceed 4 percent of the average sampling rate for the data collection period. Following each leak check, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train.
8.3.3.6 Sample Recovery. Recover each sampled sorbent trap by removing it from the probe and sealing both ends. Wipe any deposited material from the outside of the sorbent
trap. Place the sorbent trap into an appropriate sample storage container and store/preserve in appropriate manner (see section 8.3.3.8).
8.3.3.7 Stack Gas Moisture Determination. If the moisture basis of the measurements made with this method (dry) is different from the moisture basis of either: (1) the applicable emission limit; or (2) a Hg CEMS being evaluated for relative accuracy, you must determine the moisture content of the flue gas and correct for moisture using Method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part. If correction of the measured Hg concentrations for moisture is required, at least one Method 4 moisture determination shall be made during each test run.
8.3.3.8 Sample Handling, Preservation, Storage, and Transport. While the performance criteria of this approach provides for verification of appropriate sample handling, it is still important that the user consider, determine and plan for suitable sample preservation, storage, transport, and holding times for these measurements. Therefore, procedures in ASTM D6911-15 “Standard Guide for Packaging and Shipping Environmental Samples for Laboratory Analysis” (incorporated by reference-see 40 CFR 60.17) shall be followed for all samples, where appropriate. To avoid Hg contamination of the samples, special attention should be paid to cleanliness during transport, field handling, sampling, recovery, and laboratory analysis, as well as during preparation of the sorbent cartridges. Collection and analysis of blank samples (
e.g.,
reagent, sorbent, field, etc.) is useful in verifying the absence or source of contaminant Hg.
8.3.3.9 Sample Custody. Proper procedures and documentation for sample chain of custody are critical to ensuring data integrity. The chain of custody procedures in ASTM D4840-99 “Standard Guide for Sampling Chain-of-Custody Procedures” shall be followed for all samples (including field samples and blanks).

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Only NIST-certified and NIST-traceable calibration standards (i.e., calibration gases, solutions, etc.) shall be used for the spiking and analytical procedures in this method.
10.2 Gas Flow Meter Calibration.
10.2.1 Preliminaries. The manufacturer or equipment supplier of the gas flow meter should perform all necessary set-up, testing, programming, etc., and should provide the end user with any necessary instructions, to
ensure that the meter will give an accurate readout of dry gas volume in standard cubic meters for this method.
10.2.2 Initial Calibration. Prior to its initial use, a calibration of the gas flow meter shall be performed. The initial calibration may be done by the manufacturer, by the equipment supplier, or by the end user. If the flow meter is volumetric in nature (
e.g.
, a dry gas meter), the manufacturer or end user may perform a direct volumetric calibration using any gas. For a mass flow meter, the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may calibrate the meter using either: (1) A bottled gas mixture containing 12 ±0.5% CO
2
, 7 ±0.5% O
2
, and balance N
2
(when this method is applied to coal-fired boilers); (2) a bottled gas mixture containing CO
2
, O
2
, and N
2
in proportions representative of the expected stack gas composition; or (3) the actual stack gas.
10.2.2.1 Initial Calibration Procedures. Determine an average calibration factor (Y) for the gas flow meter by calibrating it at three sample flow rate settings covering the range of sample flow rates at which the sampling system will be operated. You may either follow the procedures in section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part or in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part. If a dry gas meter is being calibrated, use at least five revolutions of the meter at each flow rate.
10.2.2.2 Alternative Initial Calibration Procedures. Alternatively, you may perform the initial calibration of the gas flow meter using a reference gas flow meter (RGFM). The RGFM may be: (1) A wet test meter calibrated according to section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; (2) a gas flow metering device calibrated at multiple flow rates using the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; or (3) a NIST-traceable calibration device capable of measuring volumetric flow to an accuracy of 1 percent. To calibrate the gas flow meter using the RGFM, proceed as follows: While the Method 30B sampling system is sampling the actual stack gas or a compressed gas mixture that simulates the stack gas composition (as applicable), connect the RGFM to the discharge of the system. Care should be taken to minimize the dead volume between the gas flow meter being tested and the RGFM. Concurrently measure dry stack gas volume with the RGFM and the flow meter being calibrated for at least 10 minutes at each of three flow rates covering the typical range of operation of the sampling system. For each set of concurrent measurements, record the total sample volume, in units of dry standard cubic meters (dscm), measured by the RGFM and the gas flow meter being tested.
10.2.2.3 Initial Calibration Factor. Calculate an individual calibration factor Y
i
at each tested flow rate from section 10.2.2.1 or 10.2.2.2 of this method (as applicable) by taking the ratio of the reference sample volume to the sample volume recorded by the gas flow meter. Average the three Y
i
values, to determine Y, the calibration factor for the flow meter. Each of the three individual values of Y
i
must be within ±0.02 of Y. Except as otherwise provided in sections 10.2.2.4 and 10.2.2.5 of this method, use the average Y value from the initial 3-point calibration to adjust subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.
10.2.2.4 Pretest On-Site Calibration Check (Optional). For a mass flow meter, if the most recent 3-point calibration of the flow meter was performed using a compressed gas mixture, you may want to conduct the following on-site calibration check prior to testing, to ensure that the flow meter will accurately measure the volume of the stack gas: While sampling stack gas, check the calibration of the flow meter at one intermediate flow rate setting representative of normal operation of the sampling system. If the pretest calibration check shows that the value of Y
i
, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs from the current value of Y by more than 5 percent, perform a full 3-point recalibration of the meter using stack gas to determine a new value of Y, and (except as otherwise provided in section 10.2.2.5 of this method) apply the new Y value to the data recorded during the field test.
10.2.2.5 Post-Test Calibration Check. Check the calibration of the gas flow meter following each field test at one intermediate flow rate setting, either at, or in close proximity to, the average sample flow rate during the field test. For dry gas meters, ensure at least three revolutions of the meter during the calibration check. For mass flow meters, this check must be performed before leaving the test site, while sampling stack gas. If a one-point calibration check shows that the value of Y
i
at the tested flow rate differs by more than 5 percent from the current value of Y, repeat the full 3-point calibration procedure to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to the gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter during the field test that was just completed. For mass flow meters, perform the 3-point recalibration while sampling stack gas.
10.3 Thermocouples and Other Temperature Sensors. Use the procedures and criteria in Section 10.3 of Method 2 in appendix A-1 to this part to calibrate in-stack temperature sensors and thermocouples. Dial thermometers shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers or equivalent. Calibrations must be performed prior to initial use and before each field test thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute temperature measured by the temperature sensor must agree to within ±1.5 percent of the temperature measured with the reference
sensor, otherwise the sensor may not continue to be used.
10.4 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer or other NIST-traceable barometer as per Section 10.6 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part. Calibration must be performed prior to initial use and before each test program, and the absolute pressure measured by the barometer must agree to within ±10 mm Hg of the pressure measured by the mercury or other NIST-traceable barometer, otherwise the barometer may not continue to be used.
10.5 Other Sensors and Gauges. Calibrate all other sensors and gauges according to the procedures specified by the instrument manufacturer(s).
10.6 Analytical System Calibration. See section 11.1 of this method.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
The analysis of Hg in the field and quality control samples may be conducted using any instrument or technology capable of quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media and meeting the performance criteria in this method. Because multiple analytical approaches, equipment and techniques are appropriate for the analysis of sorbent traps, it is not possible to provide detailed, technique-specific analytical procedures. As they become available, detailed procedures for a variety of candidate analytical approaches will be posted at
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
11.1 Analytical System Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration of the analyzer at three or more upscale points over the desired quantitative range (multiple calibration ranges shall be calibrated, if necessary). The field samples analyzed must fall within a calibrated, quantitative range and meet the performance criteria specified below. For samples suitable for aliquotting, a series of dilutions may be needed to ensure that the samples fall within a calibrated range. However, for sorbent media samples consumed during analysis (e.g., when using thermal desorption techniques), extra care must be taken to ensure that the analytical system is appropriately calibrated prior to sample analysis. The calibration curve range(s) should be determined such that the levels of Hg mass expected to be collected and measured will fall within the calibrated range. The calibration curve may be generated by directly introducing standard solutions into the analyzer or by spiking the standards onto the sorbent media and then introducing into the analyzer after preparing the sorbent/standard according to the particular analytical technique. For each calibration curve, the value of the square of the linear correlation coefficient, i.e., r
2
, must be ≥0.99, and the analyzer response must be within ±10 percent of the reference value at each upscale calibration point. Calibrations must be performed on the day of the analysis, before analyzing any of the samples. Following calibration, an independent standard shall be analyzed. The measured value of the independently prepared standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.
11.2 Sample Preparation. Carefully separate the sections of each sorbent trap. Combine for analysis all materials associated with each section; any supporting substrate that the sample gas passes through prior to entering a media section (e.g., glass wool separators, acid gas traps, etc.) must be analyzed with that segment.
11.3 Field Sample Analyses. Analyze the sorbent trap samples following the same procedures that were used for conducting the Hg
0
and HgCl
2
analytical bias tests. The individual sections of the sorbent trap and their respective components must be analyzed separately (
i.e.
, section 1 and its components, then section 2 and its components). All sorbent trap section 1 sample analyses must be within the calibrated range of the analytical system as specified in Table 9-1. For wet analyses, the sample can simply be diluted to fall within the calibrated range. However, for the destructive thermal analyses, samples that are not within the calibrated range cannot be re-analyzed. As a result, the sample cannot be validated, and another sample must be collected. It is strongly suggested that the analytical system be calibrated over multiple ranges so that thermally analyzed samples fall within the calibrated range. The total mass of Hg measured in each sorbent trap section 1 must also fall within the lower and upper mass limits established during the initial Hg
0
and HgCl
2
analytical bias test. If a sample is analyzed and found to fall outside of these limits, it is acceptable for an additional Hg
0
and HgCl
2
analytical bias test to be performed that now includes this level. However, some samples (e.g., the mass collected in trap section 2), may have Hg levels so low that it may not be possible to quantify them in the analytical system's calibrated range. Because a reliable estimate of these low-level Hg measurements is necessary to fully validate the emissions data, the MDL (see section 8.2.2.1 of this method) is used to establish the minimum amount that can be detected and reported. If the measured mass or concentration is below the lowest point in the calibration curve and above the MDL, the analyst must estimate the mass or concentration of the sample based on the analytical instrument response relative to an additional calibration standard at a concentration or mass between the MDL and the lowest point in the calibration curve. This is accomplished by establishing a response factor (e.g., area counts per Hg mass or concentration) and estimating the amount of Hg present in the sample based on the analytical response and this response factor.

# Example:
The analysis of a particular sample results in a measured mass above the MDL, but below the lowest point in the calibration curve which is 10 ng. An MDL of 1.3 ng Hg has been established by the MDL study. A calibration standard containing 5 ng of Hg is analyzed and gives an analytical response of 6,170 area counts, which equates to a response factor of 1,234 area counts/ng Hg. The analytical response for the sample is 4,840 area counts. Dividing the analytical response for the sample (4,840 area counts) by the response factor gives 3.9 ng Hg, which is the estimated mass of Hg in the sample.
11.4 Analysis of Continuing Calibration Verification Standard (CCVS). After no more than 10 samples and at the end of each set of analyses, a continuing calibration verification standard must be analyzed. The measured value of the continuing calibration standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.
11.5 Blanks. The analysis of blanks is optional. The analysis of blanks is useful to verify the absence of, or an acceptable level of, Hg contamination. Blank levels should be considered when quantifying low Hg levels and their potential contribution to meeting the sorbent trap section 2 breakthrough requirements; however, correcting sorbent trap results for blank levels is prohibited.

# Performance Specification 1—Specifications and Test Procedures for Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 What Is the Purpose and Applicability of Performance Specification 1?
Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) provides (1) requirements for the design, performance, and installation of a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) and (2) data computation procedures for evaluating the acceptability of a COMS. It specifies activities for two groups (1) the owner or operator and (2) the opacity monitor manufacturer.
1.1 Measurement Parameter. PS-1 covers the instrumental measurement of opacity caused by attenuation of projected light due to absorption and scatter of the light by particulate matter in the effluent gas stream.
1.2 What COMS must comply with PS-1? If you are an owner or operator of a facility with a COMS as a result of this Part, then PS-1 applies to your COMS if one of the following is true:
(1) Your facility has a new COMS installed after February 6, 2001; or
(2) Your COMS is replaced, relocated, or substantially refurbished (in the opinion of the regulatory authority) after February 6, 2001; or
(3) Your COMS was installed before February 6, 2001 and is specifically required by regulatory action other than the promulgation of PS-1 to be recertified.
If you are an opacity monitor manufacturer, then paragraph 8.2 applies to you.
1.3 Does PS-1 apply to a facility with an applicable opacity limit less than 10 percent? If you are an owner or operator of a facility with a COMS as a result of this Part and the applicable opacity limit is less than 10 percent, then PS-1 applies to your COMS as described in section 1.2; taking into account (through statistical procedures or otherwise)
the uncertainties associated with opacity measurements, and following the conditions for attenuators selection for low opacity applications as outlined in section 8.1(3)(ii). At your option, you, the source owner or operator, may select to establish a reduced full scale range of no less than 50 percent opacity instead of the 80 percent as prescribed in section 3.5, if the applicable opacity limit for your facility is less than 10 percent. The EPA recognizes that reducing the range of the analyzer to 50 percent does not necessarily result in any measurable improvement in measurement accuracy at opacity levels less than 10 percent; however, it may allow improved chart recorder interpretation.
1.4 What data uncertainty issues apply to COMS data? The measurement uncertainties associated with COMS data result from several design and performance factors including limitations on the availability of calibration attenuators for opacities less than about 6 percent (3 percent for single-pass instruments), calibration error tolerances, zero and upscale drift tolerances, and allowance for dust compensation that are significant relative to low opacity levels. The full scale requirements of this PS may also contribute to measurement uncertainty for opacity measurements where the applicable limits are below 10 percent opacity.

# 2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of PS-1?
PS-1 requires (1) opacity monitor manufacturers comply with a comprehensive series of design and performance specifications and test procedures to certify opacity monitoring equipment before shipment to the end user, (2) the owner or operator to follow installation guidelines, and (3) the owner or operator to conduct a set of field performance tests that confirm the acceptability of the COMS after it is installed.
2.1 ASTM D6216-20 (IBR, see § 60.17) is the reference for design specifications, manufacturer's performance specifications, and test procedures. The opacity monitor manufacturer must periodically select and test an opacity monitor, that is representative of a group of monitors produced during a specified period or lot, for conformance with the design specifications in ASTM D6216-20. The opacity monitor manufacturer must test each opacity monitor for conformance with the manufacturer's performance specifications in ASTM D6216-20.
Note:
If the initial certification of the opacity monitor occurred before May 30, 2023, using D6216-98, D6216-03, D6216-07, or D6216-12, it is not necessary to recertify using D6216-20.
2.2 section 8.1(2) provides guidance for locating an opacity monitor in vertical and horizontal ducts. You are encouraged to seek approval for the opacity monitor location from the appropriate regulatory authority prior to installation.
2.3 After the COMS is installed and calibrated, the owner or operator must test the COMS for conformance with the field performance specifications in PS-1.

# 3.0 What Special Definitions Apply to PS-1?
3.1 All definitions and discussions from section 3 of ASTM D6216-20 are applicable to PS-1.
3.2
Centroid Area.
A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross-section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.
3.3

3.4
External Audit Device.
The inherent design, equipment, or accommodation of the opacity monitor allowing the independent assessment of the COMS's calibration and operation.
3.5

# 5.0 What Do I Need To Know To Ensure the Safety of Persons Using PS-1?
The procedures required under PS-1 may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. PS-1 does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. Before performing these procedures, you must establish appropriate safety and health practices, and you must determine the applicable regulatory limitations. You should consult the COMS user's manual for specific precautions to take.

# 6.0 What Equipment and Supplies Do I Need?
6.1
Continuous Opacity Monitoring System.
You, as owner or operator, are responsible
for purchasing an opacity monitor that meets the specifications of ASTM D6216-20, including a suitable data recorder or automated data acquisition handling system. Example data recorders include an analog strip chart recorder or more appropriately an electronic data acquisition and reporting system with an input signal range compatible with the analyzer output.
6.2
Calibration Attenuators.
You, as owner or operator, are responsible for purchasing a minimum of three calibration attenuators that meet the requirements of PS-1. Calibration attenuators are optical filters with neutral spectral characteristics. Calibration attenuators must meet the requirements in section 7 and must be of sufficient size to attenuate the entire light beam received by the detector of the COMS. For transmissometers operating over a narrow bandwidth (
e.g.,
laser), a calibration attenuator's value is determined for the actual operating wavelengths of the transmissometer. Some filters may not be uniform across the face. If errors result in the daily calibration drift or calibration error test, you may want to examine the across-face uniformity of the filter.
6.3
Calibration Spectrophotometer.
Whoever calibrates the attenuators must have a spectrophotometer that meets the following minimum design specifications:
Parameter
Specification
Wavelength range
300-800 nm.
Detector angle of view
10°.
Accuracy
0.5% transmittance, NIST traceable calibration.

# 7.0 What Reagents and Standards Do I Need?
You will need to use attenuators (
i.e.,
neutral density filters) to check the daily calibration drift and calibration error of a COMS. Attenuators are designated as either primary or secondary based on how they are calibrated.
7.1 Attenuators are designated primary in one of two ways:
(1) They are calibrated by NIST; or
(2) They are calibrated on a 6-month frequency through the assignment of a luminous transmittance value in the following manner:
(i) Use a spectrophotometer meeting the specifications of section 6.3 to calibrate the required filters. Verify the spectrophotometer calibration through use of a NIST 930D Standard Reference Material (SRM). A SRM 930D consists of three neutral density glass filters and a blank, each mounted in a cuvette. The wavelengths and temperature to be used in the calibration are listed on the NIST certificate that accompanies the reported values. Determine and record a transmittance of the SRM values at the NIST wavelengths (three filters at five wavelengths each for a total of 15 determinations). Calculate a percent difference between the NIST certified values and the spectrophotometer response. At least 12 of the 15 differences (in percent) must be within ±0.5 percent of the NIST SRM values. No difference can be greater than ±1.0 percent. Recalibrate the SRM or service the spectrophotometer if the calibration results fail the criteria.
(ii) Scan the filter to be tested and the NIST blank from wavelength 380 to 780 nm, and record the spectrophotometer percent transmittance responses at 10 nm intervals. Test in this sequence: blank filter, tested filter, tested filter rotated 90 degrees in the plane of the filter, blank filter. Calculate the average transmittance at each 10 nm interval. If any pair of the tested filter transmittance values (for the same filter and wavelength) differ by more than ±0.25 percent, rescan the tested filter. If the filter fails to achieve this tolerance, do not use the filter in the calibration tests of the COMS.
(iii) Correct the tested filter transmittance values by dividing the average tested filter transmittance by the average blank filter transmittance at each 10 nm interval.
(iv) Calculate the weighted (to the response of the human eye), tested filter transmittance by multiplying the transmittance value by the corresponding response factor shown in table 1-1, to obtain the Source C Human Eye Response.
(v) Recalibrate the primary attenuators semi-annually if they are used for the required calibration error test. Recalibrate the primary attenuators annually if they are used only for calibration of secondary attenuators.
7.2 Attenuators are designated secondary if the filter calibration is done using a laboratory-based transmissometer. Conduct the secondary attenuator calibration using a laboratory-based transmissometer calibrated as follows:
(i) Use at least three primary filters of nominal luminous transmittance 50, 70 and 90 percent, calibrated as specified in section 7.1(2)(i), to calibrate the laboratory-based transmissometer. Determine and record the slope of the calibration line using linear regression through zero opacity. The slope of the calibration line must be between 0.99 and 1.01, and the laboratory-based transmissometer reading for each primary filter must not deviate by more than ±2 percent from the linear regression line. If the calibration of the laboratory-based transmissometer yields a slope or individual readings outside the specified ranges, secondary filter calibrations cannot be performed. Determine the source of the variations (either transmissometer performance or changes in the primary filters) and repeat the transmissometer calibration before proceeding with the attenuator calibration.
(ii) Immediately following the laboratory-based transmissometer calibration, insert the secondary attenuators and determine and record the percent effective opacity value per secondary attenuator from the calibration curve (linear regression line).
(iii) Recalibrate the secondary attenuators semi-annually if they are used for the required calibration error test.

# 8.0 What Performance Procedures Are Required To Comply With PS-1?
Procedures to verify the performance of the COMS are divided into those completed by the owner or operator and those completed by the opacity monitor manufacturer.
8.1 What procedures must I follow as the Owner or Operator?
(1) You must purchase an opacity monitor that complies with ASTM D6216-20 and obtain a certificate of conformance from the opacity monitor manufacturer.
(2) You must install the opacity monitor at a location where the opacity measurements are representative of the total emissions from the affected facility. You must meet this requirement by choosing a measurement location and a light beam path as follows:
(i) Measurement Location. Select a measurement location that is (1) at least 4 duct diameters downstream from all particulate control equipment or flow disturbance, (2) at least 2 duct diameters upstream of a flow disturbance, (3) where condensed water vapor is not present, and (4) accessible in order to permit maintenance. Alternatively, you may select a measurement location specified in paragraph 8.1(2)(ii) or 8.1(2)(iii).
(ii) Light Beam Path. Select a light beam path that passes through the centroidal area of the stack or duct. Also, you must follow these additional requirements or modifications for these measurement locations:
If your measurement location is in a:
And is:
Then use a light beam path that is:
1. Straight vertical section of stack or duct
Less than 4 equivalent diameters downstream from a bend
In the plane defined by the upstream bend (see figure 1-1).
2. Straight vertical section of stack or duct
Less than 4 equivalent diameters upstream from a bend
In the plane defined by the downstream bend (see figure 1-2).
3. Straight vertical section of stack or duct
Less than 4 equivalent diameters downstream and is also less than 1 diameter upstream from a bend
In the plane defined by the upstream bend (see figure 1-3).
4. Horizontal section of stack or duct
At least 4 equivalent diameters downstream from a vertical bend
In the horizontal plane that is between
1/3
and
1/2
the distance up the vertical axis from the bottom of the duct (see figure 1-4).
5. Horizontal section of duct
Less than 4 equivalent diameters downstream from a vertical bend
In the horizontal plane that is between
1/2
and
2/3
the distance up the vertical axis from the bottom of the duct for upward flow in the vertical section, and is between
1/3
and
1/2
the distance up the vertical axis from the bottom of the duct for downward flow (figure 1-5).
(iii) Alternative Locations and Light Beam Paths. You may select locations and light beam paths, other than those cited in section 8.1(2)(ii) of this method, if you demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator or delegated agent, that the average opacity measured at the alternative location or path is equivalent to the opacity as measured at a location meeting the criteria of sections 8.1(2)(i) and (ii) of this method. The opacity at the alternative location is considered equivalent if (1) the average opacity value measured at the alternative location is within ±10 percent of the average opacity value measured at the location meeting the installation criteria, and (2) the difference between any two average opacity values is less than 2 percent opacity (absolute). You use the following procedure to conduct this demonstration: simultaneously measure the opacities at the two locations or paths for a minimum period of time (
e.g.,
180-minutes) covering the range of normal operating conditions and compare the results. You may use alternative procedures for determining acceptable locations if those procedures are approved by the Administrator.
(3) Field Audit Performance Tests. After you install the COMS, you must perform the following procedures and tests on the COMS.
(i) Optical Alignment Assessment. Verify and record that all alignment indicator devices show proper alignment. A clear indication of alignment is one that is objectively apparent relative to reference marks or conditions.
(ii) Calibration Error Check. Conduct a three-point calibration error test using three calibration attenuators that produce outlet pathlength corrected, single-pass opacity values shown in ASTM D6216-20, section 7.5. If your applicable limit is less than 10 percent opacity, use attenuators as described in ASTM D6216-20, section 7.5 for applicable standards of 10 to 19 percent opacity. Confirm the external audit device produces the proper zero value on the COMS data recorder. Separately, insert each calibration
attenuators (low, mid, and high-level) into the external audit device. While inserting each attenuator, (1) ensure that the entire light beam passes through the attenuator, (2) minimize interference from reflected light, and (3) leave the attenuator in place for at least two times the shortest recording interval on the COMS data recorder. Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each attenuator. At the end of the test, correlate each attenuator insertion to the corresponding value from the data recorder. Subtract the single-pass calibration attenuator values corrected to the stack exit conditions from the COMS responses. Calculate the arithmetic mean difference, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the five measurements value using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5 of this method. Calculate the calibration error as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence coefficient for each of the three test attenuators using equation 1-6 of this method. Report the calibration error test results for each of the three attenuators.
(iii) System Response Time Check. Using a high-level calibration attenuator, alternately insert the filter five times and remove it from the external audit device. For each filter insertion and removal, measure the amount of time required for the COMS to display 95 percent of the step change in opacity on the COMS data recorder. For the upscale response time, measure the time from insertion to display of 95 percent of the final, steady upscale reading. For the downscale response time, measure the time from removal to display 5 percent of the initial upscale reading. Calculate the mean of the five upscale response time measurements and the mean of the five downscale response time measurements. Report both the upscale and downscale response times.
(iv) Averaging Period Calculation and Recording Check. After the calibration error check, conduct a check of the averaging period calculation (e.g., 6-minute integrated average). Consecutively insert each of the calibration error check attenuators (low, mid, and high-level) into the external audit device for a period of two times the averaging period plus 1 minute (e.g., 13 minutes for a 6-minute averaging period). Compare the path length corrected opacity value of each attenuator to the valid average value calculated by the COMS data recording device for that attenuator.
(4) Operational Test Period. Before conducting the operational testing, you must have successfully completed the field audit tests described in sections 8.1(3)(i) through 8.1(3)(iv). Then, you operate the COMS for an initial 168-hour test period while the source is operating under normal operating conditions. If normal operations contain routine source shutdowns, include the source's down periods in the 168-hour operational test period. However, you must ensure that the following minimum source operating time is included in the operational test period: (1) For a batch operation, the operational test period must include at least one full cycle of batch operation during the 168-hour period unless the batch operation is longer than 168 hours or (2) for continuous operating processes, the unit must be operating for at least 50 percent of the 168-hour period. Except during times of instrument zero and upscale calibration drift checks, you must analyze the effluent gas for opacity and produce a permanent record of the COMS output. During this period, you may not perform unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment to the COMS. Automatic zero and calibration adjustments (
i.e.,
intrinsic adjustments), made by the COMS without operator intervention or initiation, are allowable at any time. At the end of the operational test period, verify and record that the COMS optical alignment is still correct. If the test period is interrupted because of COMS failure, record the time when the failure occurred. After the failure is corrected, you restart the 168-hour period and tests from the beginning (0-hour). During the operational test period, perform the following test procedures:
(i) Zero Calibration Drift Test. At the outset of the 168-hour operational test period and at each 24-hour interval, the automatic calibration check system must initiate the simulated zero device to allow the zero drift to be determined. Record the COMS response to the simulated zero device. After each 24-hour period, subtract the COMS zero reading from the nominal value of the simulated zero device to calculate the 24-hour zero drift (ZD). At the end of the 168-hour period, calculate the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the 24-hour ZDs using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the confidence coefficient using equation 1-6, and report this value as the 24-hour ZD error.
(ii) Upscale Calibration Drift Test. At each 24-hour interval after the simulated zero device value has been checked, check and record the COMS response to the upscale calibration device. After each 24-hour period, subtract the COMS upscale reading from the nominal value of the upscale calibration device to calculate the 24-hour calibration drift (CD). At the end of the 168-hour period, calculate the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the 24-hour CD using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the confidence coefficient using equation 1-6, and report this value as the 24-hour CD error.
(5) Retesting. If the COMS fails to meet the specifications for the tests conducted under
the operational test period, make the necessary corrections and restart the operational test period. Depending on the opinion of the enforcing agency, you may have to repeat some or all of the field audit tests.
8.2 What are the responsibilities of the Opacity Monitor Manufacturer?
You, the manufacturer, must carry out the following activities:
(1) Conduct the verification procedures for design specifications in section 6 of ASTM D6216-20.

The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR Part 60, § 60.13(c).

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
Procedures for measuring CEMS relative accuracy and calibration drift are outlined. CEMS installation and measurement location specifications, equipment specifications, performance specifications, and data reduction procedures are included. Conformance of the CEMS with the Performance Specification is determined.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Calibration Drift (CD)
means the difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
3.2
Centroidal Area

3.3
Continuous Emission Monitoring System
means the total equipment required for the determination of a gas concentration or emission rate. The sample interface, pollutant analyzer, diluent analyzer, and data recorder are the major subsystems of the CEMS.
3.4
Data Recorder
means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities.
3.5
Diluent Analyzer
means that portion of the CEMS that senses the diluent gas (
i.e.,
CO
2
or O
2
) and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.
3.6
Path CEMS
means a CEMS that measures the gas concentration along a path greater than 10 percent of the equivalent diameter of the stack or duct cross section.
3.7
Point CEMS
means a CEMS that measures the gas concentration either at a single point or along a path equal to or less than 10 percent of the equivalent diameter of the stack or duct cross section.
3.8
Pollutant Analyzer
means that portion of the CEMS that senses the pollutant gas and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.
3.9
Relative Accuracy (RA)
means the absolute mean difference between the gas concentration or emission rate determined by the CEMS and the value determined by the reference method (RM), plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests, divided by the mean of the RM tests or the applicable emission limit.
3.10
Sample Interface
means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample delivery, sample conditioning, or protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
3.11
Span Value
means the calibration portion of the measurement range as specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement. If the span is not specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement, then it must be a value approximately equivalent to two times the emission standard. For spans less than 500 ppm, the span value may either be rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm, or to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm such that the equivalent emission concentration is not less than 30 percent of the selected span value.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the reference method should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 CEMS Equipment Specifications.
6.1.1 Data Recorder. The portion of the CEMS that provides a record of analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder output range must include the full range of expected concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and span values.
6.1.2 The CEMS design should also allow the determination of calibration drift at the zero and span values. If this is not possible or practical, the design must allow these determinations to be conducted at a low-level value (zero to 20 percent of the span value) and at a value between 50 and 100 percent of the span value. In special cases, the Administrator may approve a single-point calibration drift determination.
6.2 Other equipment and supplies, as needed by the applicable reference method(s) (see section 8.4.2 of this Performance Specification), may be required.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Reference Gases, Gas Cells, or Optical Filters. As specified by the CEMS manufacturer for calibration of the CEMS (these need not be certified).
7.2 Reagents and Standards. May be required as needed by the applicable reference method(s) (see section 8.4.2 of this Performance Specification).

# 8.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure
8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.
8.1.1 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location where the pollutant concentration or emission rate measurements are directly representative or can be corrected so as to be representative of the total emissions from the affected facility or at the measurement location cross section. Then select representative measurement points or paths for monitoring in locations that the CEMS will pass the RA test (see section 8.4). If the cause of failure to meet the RA test is determined to be the measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated. Suggested measurement locations and points or paths that are most likely to provide data that will meet the RA requirements are listed below.
8.1.2 CEMS Measurement Location. It is suggested that the measurement location be (1) at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur and (2) at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device.
8.1.2.1 Point CEMS. It is suggested that the measurement point be (1) no less than 1.0 meter (3.3 ft) from the stack or duct wall or (2) within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
8.1.2.2 Path CEMS. It is suggested that the effective measurement path (1) be totally within the inner area bounded by a line 1.0 meter (3.3 ft) from the stack or duct wall, or (2) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area, or (3) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.
8.1.3 Reference Method Measurement Location and Traverse Points.
8.1.3.1 Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement point at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur, and at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (
e.g.,
air heater leakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at the same location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters. The CEMS and RM locations need not be the same.
8.1.3.2 Select traverse points that assure acquisition of representative samples over the stack or duct cross section. The minimum requirements are as follows: Establish a “measurement line” that passes through the centroidal area and in the direction of any expected stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, displace the line up to 30 cm (12 in.) (or 5 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less) from the centroidal area. Locate three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. If the measurement line is longer than 2.4 meters (7.8 ft) and pollutant stratification is not expected, the three traverse points may be located on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. This option must not be used after wet scrubbers or at points where two streams with different pollutant concentrations are combined. If stratification is suspected, the following procedure is suggested. For rectangular ducts, locate at least nine sample points in the cross section such that sample points are the centroids of similarly-shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section. Measure the pollutant concentration, and, if applicable, the diluent concentration at each point using appropriate reference methods or other appropriate instrument methods that give responses relative to pollutant concentrations. Then calculate the mean value for all sample points. For circular ducts, conduct a 12-point traverse (
i.e.,
six points on each of the two
perpendicular diameters) locating the sample points as described in 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, Method 1. Perform the measurements and calculations as described above. Determine if the mean pollutant concentration is more than 10% different from any single point. If so, the cross section is considered to be stratified, and the tester may not use the alternative traverse point locations (...0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall.) but must use the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the entire measurement line. Other traverse points may be selected, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct cross section. Conduct all necessary RM tests within 3 cm (1.2 in.) of the traverse points, but no closer than 3 cm (1.2 in.) to the stack or duct wall.
8.2 Pretest Preparation. Install the CEMS, prepare the RM test site according to the specifications in section 8.1, and prepare the CEMS for operation according to the manufacturer's written instructions.
8.3 Calibration Drift Test Procedure.
8.3.1
CD Test Period.
While the affected facility is operating, determine the magnitude of the CD once each day (at 24-hour intervals) for 7 consecutive calendar days according to the procedure given in sections 8.3.2 through 8.3.4. Alternatively, the CD test may be conducted over 7 consecutive unit operating days.
8.3.2 The purpose of the CD measurement is to verify the ability of the CEMS to conform to the established CEMS calibration used for determining the emission concentration or emission rate. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined.
8.3.3 Conduct the CD test at the two points specified in section 6.1.2 of this method. Introduce to the CEMS the reference gases, gas cells, or optical filters (these need not be certified). When using reference gases, introduce the reference gas prior to any sample conditioning or filtration equipment and ensure that it passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling. The reference gas should pass through as much of the sampling probe as practical. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference value (see example data sheet in figure 2-1 of this method).
8.4 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.
8.4.1 RA Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure given in sections 8.4.2 through 8.4.6 while the affected facility is operating at more than 50 percent of normal load, or as specified in an applicable subpart. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.
8.4.2 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations, Methods 3B, 4, 6, and 7, or their approved alternatives, are the reference methods for diluent (O
2
and CO
2
), moisture, SO
2
, and NO
X
, respectively.
8.4.3 Sampling Strategy for RM Tests. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be correlated to the CEMS data. It is preferable to conduct the diluent (if applicable), moisture (if needed), and pollutant measurements simultaneously. However, diluent and moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the pollutant measurements may be used to calculate dry pollutant concentration and emission rates. In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, note the beginning and end of each RM test period of each run (including the exact time of day) on the CEMS chart recordings or other permanent record of output. Use the following strategies for the RM tests:
8.4.3.1 For integrated samples (
e.g.,
Methods 6 and Method 4), make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for an equal time at each traverse point (see section 8.1.3.2 for discussion of traverse points.
8.4.3.2 For grab samples (
e.g.,
Method 7), take one sample at each traverse point, scheduling the grab samples so that they are taken simultaneously (within a 3-minute period) or at an equal interval of time apart over the span of time the CEM pollutant is measured. A test run for grab samples must be made up of at least three separate measurements.

# Note:
At times, CEMS RA tests are conducted during new source performance standards performance tests. In these cases, RM results obtained during CEMS RA tests may be used to determine compliance as long as the source and test conditions are consistent with the applicable regulations.
8.4.4 Number of RM Tests. Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessary RM test runs.

# Note:
More than nine sets of RM tests may be performed. If this option is chosen, a maximum of three sets of the test results may be rejected so long as the total number of test results used to determine the RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported, including the rejected data.
8.4.5 Correlation of RM and CEMS Data. Correlate the CEMS and the RM test data as to the time and duration by first determining from the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) the integrated average pollutant concentration or emission rate for each pollutant RM test period. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the pair of results are on a consistent
moisture, temperature, and diluent concentration basis. Then, compare each integrated CEMS value against the corresponding average RM value. Use the following guidelines to make these comparisons.
8.4.5.1 If the RM has an integrated sampling technique, make a direct comparison of the RM results and CEMS integrated average value.
8.4.5.2 If the RM has a grab sampling technique, first average the results from all grab samples taken during the test run, and then compare this average value against the integrated value obtained from the CEMS chart recording or output during the run. If the pollutant concentration is varying with time over the run, the arithmetic average of the CEMS value recorded at the time of each grab sample may be used.
8.4.6 Calculate the mean difference between the RM and CEMS values in the units of the emission standard, the standard deviation, the confidence coefficient, and the relative accuracy according to the procedures in section 12.0.
8.5 Reporting. At a minimum (check with the appropriate regional office, State, or Local agency for additional requirements, if any), summarize in tabular form the results of the CD tests and the RA tests or alternative RA procedure, as appropriate. Include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of CEMS responses), cylinder gas concentration certifications, and calibration cell response certifications (if applicable) necessary to confirm that the performance of the CEMS met the performance specifications.

# 16.0 Alternative Procedures
Paragraphs 60.13(j)(1) and (2) of 40 CFR part 60 contain criteria for which the reference method procedure for determining relative
accuracy (see section 8.4 of this Performance Specification) may be waived and the following procedure substituted.
16.1 Conduct a complete CEMS status check following the manufacturer's written instructions. The check should include operation of the light source, signal receiver, timing mechanism functions, data acquisition and data reduction functions, data recorders, mechanically operated functions (mirror movements, zero pipe operation, calibration gas valve operations, etc.), sample filters, sample line heaters, moisture traps, and other related functions of the CEMS, as applicable. All parts of the CEMS shall be functioning properly before proceeding to the alternative RA procedure.
16.2 Alternative RA Procedure.
16.2.1 Challenge each monitor (both pollutant and diluent, if applicable) with cylinder gases of known concentrations or calibration cells that produce known responses at two measurement points within the ranges shown in Table 2-2 (Section 18).
16.2.2 Use a separate cylinder gas (for point CEMS only) or calibration cell (for path CEMS or where compressed gas cylinders can not be used) for measurement points 1 and 2. Challenge the CEMS and record the responses three times at each measurement point. The Administrator may allow dilution of cylinder gas using the performance criteria in Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M. Use the average of the three responses in determining relative accuracy.
16.2.3 Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode as nearly as possible. When using cylinder gases, pass the cylinder gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling and as much of the sampling probe as practical. When using calibration cells, the CEMS components used in the normal sampling mode should not be by-passed during the RA determination. These include light sources, lenses, detectors, and reference cells. The CEMS should be challenged at each measurement point for a sufficient period of time to assure adsorption-desorption reactions on the CEMS surfaces have stabilized.
16.2.4 Use cylinder gases that have been certified by comparison to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) gaseous standard reference material (SRM) or NIST/EPA approved gas manufacturer's certified reference material (CRM) (See Reference 2 in section 17.0) following EPA Traceability Protocol Number 1 (See Reference 3 in section 17.0). As an alternative to Protocol Number 1 gases, CRM's may be used directly as alternative RA cylinder gases. A list of gas manufacturers that have prepared approved CRM's is available from EPA at the address shown in Reference 2. Procedures for preparation of CRM's are described in Reference 2.
16.2.5 Use calibration cells certified by the manufacturer to produce a known response in the CEMS. The cell certification procedure shall include determination of CEMS response produced by the calibration cell in direct comparison with measurement of gases of known concentration. This can be accomplished using SRM or CRM gases in a laboratory source simulator or through extended tests using reference methods at the CEMS location in the exhaust stack. These procedures are discussed in Reference 4 in section 17.0. The calibration cell certification procedure is subject to approval of the Administrator.
16.3 The differences between the known concentrations of the cylinder gases and the concentrations indicated by the CEMS are used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS. The calculations and limits of acceptable relative accuracy are as follows:
16.3.1 For pollutant CEMS:
ER17OC00.460
Where:
d
= Average difference between responses and the concentration/responses (see section 16.2.2).
AC = The known concentration/response of the cylinder gas or calibration cell.
16.3.2 For diluent CEMS:
RA=
d; ≤0.7 percent O
2
or CO
2
, as applicable.

# Note:
Waiver of the relative accuracy test in favor of the alternative RA procedure does not preclude the requirements to complete the CD tests nor any other requirements specified in an applicable subpart for reporting CEMS data and performing CEMS drift checks or audits.

1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of carbon monoxide (CO) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of installation or soon after and whenever specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. This specification was developed primarily for CEMS that comply with low emission standards (less than 200 ppmv).
1.2.2 This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and other auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the source owner or operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate CEMS performance. See 40 CFR Part 60, section 60.13(c).
1.2.3 The definitions, performance specification, test procedures, calculations and data analysis procedures for determining calibration drifts (CD) and relative accuracy (RA), of Performance Specification 2 (PS 2), sections 3, 8.0, and 12, respectively, apply to this specification.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
The CD and RA tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS to the specification.

# 3.0 Definitions
Same as in section 3.0 of PS 2.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
This performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing this performance specification. The CEMS users manual should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken with regard to the analytical procedures.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
Same as section 6.0 of PS 2 with the following additions.
6.1 Data Recorder Scale.
6.1.1 This specification is the same as section 6.1 of PS 2. The CEMS shall be capable of measuring emission levels under normal conditions and under periods of short-duration peaks of high concentrations. This dual-range capability may be met using two separate analyzers (one for each range) or by using dual-range units which have the capability of measuring both levels with a single unit. In the latter case, when the reading goes above the full-scale measurement value of the lower range, the higher-range operation shall be started automatically. The CEMS recorder range must include zero and a high-level value. Under applications of consistent low emissions, a single-range analyzer is allowed provided normal and spike emissions can be quantified. In this case, set an appropriate high-level value to include all emissions.
6.1.2 For the low-range scale of dual-range units, the high-level value shall be between 1.5 times the pollutant concentration corresponding to the emission standard level and the span value. For the high-range scale, the high-level value shall be set at 2000 ppm, as a minimum, and the range shall include the level of the span value. There shall be no concentration gap between the low-and high-range scales.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Same as section 7.0 of PS 2.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure. Sampling Strategy for reference method (RM) Tests, Number of RM Tests, and Correlation of RM and CEMS Data are the same as PS 2, sections 8.4.3, 8.4.4, and 8.4.5, respectively.
8.2 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of the regulation, Methods 10, 10A, 10B, or other approved alternative is the RM for this PS. When evaluating nondispersive infrared CEMS using Method 10 as the RM, the alternative interference trap specified in section 16.0 of Method 10 shall be used.
8.3 Response Time Test Procedure. The response time test applies to all types of CEMS, but will generally have significance only for extractive systems. The entire system is checked with this procedure including applicable sample extraction and transport, sample conditioning, gas analyses, and data recording.
8.3.1 Introduce zero gas into the system. When the system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of full scale for 30 sec), introduce an upscale calibration gas and wait for a stable value. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percent of the final stable value. Next, reintroduce the zero gas and wait for a stable reading before recording the response time (downscale response time). Repeat the entire procedure until you have three sets of data to determine the mean upscale and downscale response times. The slower or longer of the two means is the system response time.
8.4 Interference Check. The CEMS must be shown to be free from the effects of any interferences.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Calibration Drift. The CEMS calibration must not drift or deviate from the reference value of the calibration gas, gas cell, or optical filter by more than 5 percent of the established span value for 6 out of 7 test days.
13.2 Relative Accuracy. The RA of the CEMS must be no greater than 10 percent when the average RM value is used to calculate RA, 5 percent when the applicable emission standard is used to calculate RA, or within 5 ppmv when the RA is calculated as the absolute average difference between the RM and CEMS plus the 2.5 percent confidence coefficient.
13.3 Response Time. The CEMS response time shall not exceed 240 seconds to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.

# 14.0 Pollution Prevention
[Reserved]

# 15.0 Waste Management
[Reserved]

# 16.0 Alternative Procedures
16.1 Under conditions where the average CO emissions are less than 10 percent of the standard and this is verified by Method 10, a cylinder gas audit may be performed in place of the RA test to determine compliance with these limits. In this case, the cylinder gas shall contain CO in 12 percent carbon dioxide as an interference check. If this option is exercised, Method 10 must be used to verify that emission levels are less than 10 percent of the standard.

The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to properly calibrate,
maintain, and operate the CEMS. To evaluate the CEMS' performance, the Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at times other than the initial test.
1.2.3. The definitions, installation, and measurement location specifications, test procedures, data reduction procedures, reporting requirements, and bibliography are the same as in Performance Specification (PS) 3 (for O
2
) and PS 4A (for CO) of this appendix except as otherwise noted in this specification.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
Installation and measurement location specifications, performance specifications, test procedures, and data reduction procedures are included in this specification. Reference method tests, calibration error tests, calibration drift tests, and interferant tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specification.

# 3.0 Definitions
The definitions are the same as in section 3.0 of PS 2 with the following definitions added:
3.1.
Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS).
This definition is the same as section 3.0 of PS 2 with the following addition. A continuous monitor is one in which the sample to be analyzed passes the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption.
3.2.
Response Time (RT).
The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input and when the pollutant analyzer output reaches 95 percent of the final value.
3.3.

This performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing this performance specification. The CEMS user's manual should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken with regard to the analytical procedures.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
Same as section 6.0 of PS 2, except for the following:
6.1 Data Recorder Scale. For O
2
, same as specified in PS 3, except that the span must be 25 percent. The span of the O
2
may be higher if the O
2
concentration at the sampling point can be greater than 25 percent. For CO, same as specified in PS 4A, except that the low-range span must be 200 ppm and the high range span must be 3000 ppm. In addition, the scale for both CEMS must record all readings within a measurement range with a resolution of 0.5 percent.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1. Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.
8.1.1. The CEMS Installation. This specification is the same as section 8.1.1 of PS 2 with the following additions. Both the CO and O
2
monitors should be installed at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.
8.1.2. Measurement Location. Same as section 8.1.2 of PS 2.
8.1.2.1. Point CEMS. The measurement point should be within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
8.1.2.2. Path CEMS. The effective measurement path should: (1) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross sectional area, or (2) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.
8.1.3. Reference Method (RM) Measurement Location and Traverse Points.
This specification is the same as section 8.1.3 of PS 2 with the following additions. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage and CO and O
2
are simultaneously measured at the same location, one half diameter may be used in place of two equivalent diameters.
8.2 Pretest Preparation. Install the CEMS, prepare the RM test site according to the specifications in section 8.1 of this method, and prepare the CEMS for operation according to the manufacturer's written instructions.
8.3 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as the difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe
system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate change in the effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in method 1 in appendix A to this part. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.
8.4 Calibration Drift (CD) Test Procedure. Same as section 8.3 in PS 2.

# Note:
The CE and RT tests must be conducted during the CD test period.
8.5 Calibration Error Test Procedure. Challenge each monitor (both low and high range CO and O
2
) with zero gas and EPA Protocol 1 cylinder gases at three measurement points within the ranges specified in table 4B-1 of this method (in section 18.0).
Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode as nearly as possible. The calibration gas must be injected into the sample system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical and should pass through all CEMS components used during normal sampling. Challenge the CEMS three non-consecutive times at each measurement point and record the responses. The duration of each gas injection should be sufficient to ensure that the CEMS surfaces are conditioned.
8.6 Response Time Test Procedure. Same as section 8.3 in PS 4A and must be carried out for both the CO and O
2
monitors.
8.7 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure. Sampling Strategy for Reference Method (RM) Tests, Number of RM Tests, and Correlation of RM and CEMS Data are the same as PS 2, sections 8.4.3, 8.4.4, and 8.4.5, respectively.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
Sample collection and analysis are concurrent for this performance specification (see section 8.0 of this method). Refer to the RM for specific analytical procedures.

# 12.0 Calculation and Data Analysis
Summarize the results on a data sheet as shown in figure 4B-1 of this method (in section 18.0).
Calibration Error (CE) is the average the differences between the instrument response and the certified cylinder gas value for each gas. Calculate the CE results for the CO monitor according to:
ER29MR23.009
Where:
d = mean difference between the CEMS response and the known reference concentration, and
FS = span value.
The CE for the O
2
monitor is the average percent O
2
difference between the O
2
monitor and the certified cylinder gas value for each gas.

13.1. Calibration Drift Performance Specification. For O
2
, same as specified in PS 3. For CO, the same as specified in PS 4A except that the CEMS calibration must not drift from the reference value of the calibration standard by more than 3 percent of the span value on either the high or low range.
13.2. Calibration Error (CE) Performance Specification. The mean difference between the CEMS and reference values at all three test points (see table 4B-1 of this method) must be no greater than 5 percent of span value for CO monitors and 0.5 percent for O
2
monitors.
13.3. Response Time Performance Specification. The response time for the CO or O
2
monitor must not exceed 240 seconds.
13.4. Relative Accuracy (RA) Performance Specification. For O
2
, same as specified in PS 3. For CO, the same as specified in PS 4A.

# 14.0 Pollution Prevention [Reserved]

# 15.0 Waste Management [Reserved]

# 16.0 Alternative Procedure
Alternative RA Procedure. Under some operating conditions, it may not be possible to obtain meaningful results using the RA test procedure. This includes conditions where consistent, very low CO emission or low CO emissions interrupted periodically by short duration, high level spikes are observed. It may be appropriate in these circumstances to waive the RA test and substitute the following procedure.
Conduct a complete CEMS status check following the manufacturer's written instructions. The check should include operation of the light source, signal receiver,
timing mechanism functions, data acquisition and data reduction functions, data recorders, mechanically operated functions, sample filters, sample line heaters, moisture traps, and other related functions of the CEMS, as applicable. All parts of the CEMS must be functioning properly before the RA requirement can be waived. The instrument must also successfully pass the CE and CD specifications. Substitution of the alternate procedure requires approval of the Regional Administrator.

8.1 Calibration Drift Test Procedure.
8.1.1 The CD measurements are to verify the ability of the CERMS to conform to the established CERMS calibrations used for determining the emission rate. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CERMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD tests immediately before these adjustments, or conduct them in such a way that CD can be determined.
8.1.2 Conduct the CD tests for pollutant concentration at the two values specified in section 6.1.2 of PS 2. For other parameters that are selectively measured by the CERMS (
e.g.,
velocity, pressure, flow rate), use two analogous values (
e.g.,
Low: 0-20% of full scale, High: 50-100% of full scale). Introduce to the CERMS the reference signals (these need not be certified). Record the CERMS response to each and subtract this value from the respective reference value (see example data sheet in Figure 6-1).
8.2 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.
8.2.1 Sampling Strategy for reference method (RM) Tests, Correlation of RM and CERMS Data, and Number of RM Tests are the same as PS 2, sections 8.4.3, 8.4.5, and 8.4.4, respectively. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 6-1. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.
8.2.2 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart of the regulations, the RM for the pollutant gas is the Appendix A method that is cited for compliance test purposes, or its approved alternatives. Methods 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, or 2D, as applicable, are the RMs for the determination of volumetric flow rate.

13.1 Calibration Drift. Since the CERMS includes analyzers for several measurements, the CD shall be determined separately for each analyzer in terms of its specific measurement. The calibration for each analyzer associated with the measurement of flow rate shall not drift or deviate from each reference value of flow rate by more than 3 percent of the respective high-level reference value over the CD test period (
e.g.,
seven-day) associated with the pollutant analyzer. The CD specification for each analyzer for which other PSs have been established (
e.g.,
PS 2 for SO

and NO
X
), shall be the same as in the applicable PS.
13.2 CERMS Relative Accuracy. Calculate the CERMS Relative Accuracy (RA) expressed as a percentage using equation 2-6 of section 12 of PS 2. The RA of the CERMS shall be no greater than 20.0 percent in terms of the units of the emission standard. If the average emissions for the test are less than 50 percent of the applicable emission standard, you may elect to substitute the applicable emission standard value in the denominator of equation 2-6 in place of the average RM value; in this case, the RA of the CERMS shall be no greater than 10.0 percent consistent with section 13.2 of PS 2.

# Performance Specification 8—Performance Specifications for Volatile Organic Compound Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This specification is to be used for evaluating a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that measures a mixture of VOC's and generates a single combined response value. The VOC detection principle may be flame ionization (FI), photoionization (PI), non-dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR), or any other detection principle that is appropriate for the VOC species present in the emission gases and that meets this performance specification. The performance specification includes procedures to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of or soon after its installation and whenever specified in emission regulations or permits. This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS performance over an extended period of time, nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and other auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS performance. The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. To evaluate the CEMS performance, the Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations in addition to the initial test. See section 60.13(c).
1.2.2 In most emission circumstances, most VOC monitors can provide only a relative measure of the total mass or volume concentration of a mixture of organic gases, rather than an accurate quantification. This
problem is removed when an emission standard is based on a total VOC measurement as obtained with a particular detection principle. In those situations where a true mass or volume VOC concentration is needed, the problem can be mitigated by using the VOC CEMS as a relative indicator of total VOC concentration if statistical analysis indicates that a sufficient margin of compliance exists for this approach to be acceptable. Otherwise, consideration can be given to calibrating the CEMS with a mixture of the same VOC's in the same proportions as they actually occur in the measured source. In those circumstances where only one organic species is present in the source, or where equal incremental amounts of each of the organic species present generate equal CEMS responses, the latter choice can be more easily achieved.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
2.1 Calibration drift and relative accuracy tests are conducted to determine adherence of the CEMS with specifications given for those items. The performance specifications include criteria for installation and measurement location, equipment and performance, and procedures for testing and data reduction.

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment.

It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the application regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the reference method should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 VOC CEMS Selection. When possible, select a VOC CEMS with the detection principle of the reference method specified in the regulation or permit (usually either FI, NDIR, or PI). Otherwise, use knowledge of the source process chemistry, previous emission studies, or gas chromatographic analysis of the source gas to select an appropriate VOC CEMS.

# Performance Specification 8A—Specifications and Test Procedures for Total Hydrocarbon Continuous Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1. Applicability and Principle
1.1
Applicability.
These performance specifications apply to hydrocarbon (HC) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS)
installed on stationary sources. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.
1.2
Principle.
A gas sample is extracted from the source through a heated sample line and heated filter to a flame ionization detector (FID). Results are reported as volume concentration equivalents of propane. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.

# 2. Definitions
2.1
Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS).
The total equipment used to acquire data, which includes sample extraction and transport hardware, analyzer, data recording and processing hardware, and software. The system consists of the following major subsystems:
2.1.1
Sample Interface.
That portion of the system that is used for one or more of the following: Sample acquisition, sample transportation, sample conditioning, or protection of the analyzer from the effects of the stack effluent.
2.1.2
Organic Analyzer.
That portion of the system that senses organic concentration and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.
2.1.3
Data Recorder.
That portion of the system that records a permanent record of the measurement values. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities.
2.2
Instrument Measurement Range.
The difference between the minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum.
2.3
Span or Span Value.
Full scale instrument measurement range. The span value must be documented by the CEMS manufacturer with laboratory data.
2.4
Calibration Gas.
A known concentration of a gas in an appropriate diluent gas.
2.5
Calibration Drift (CD).
The difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. A CD test is performed to demonstrate the stability of the CEMS calibration over time.
2.6
Response Time.
The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.
2.7
Accuracy.
A measurement of agreement between a measured value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a calibration error (CE) test.
2.8
Calibration Error (CE).
The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement range.
2.9
Performance Specification Test (PST) Period.
The period during which CD, CE, and response time tests are conducted.
2.10
Centroidal Area.
A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.

# 3. Installation and Measurement Location Specifications
3.1
CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations.
The CEMS must be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox (where applicable). The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated as described in section 3.2. The measurement point must be within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
3.2
Stratification Test Procedure.
Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct
or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, method 1. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.

# 4. CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications
If this method is applied in highly explosive areas, caution and care must be exercised in choice of equipment and installation.
4.1
Flame Ionization Detector (FID) Analyzer.
A heated FID analyzer capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements of these specifications. Heated systems must maintain the temperature of the sample gas between 150 °C (300 °F) and 175 °C (350 °F) throughout the system. This requires all system components such as the probe, calibration valve, filter, sample lines, pump, and the FID to be kept heated at all times such that no moisture is condensed out of the system. The essential components of the measurement system are described below:
4.1.1
Sample Probe.
Stainless steel, or equivalent, to collect a gas sample from the centroidal area of the stack cross-section.
4.1.2
Sample Line.
Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the sample to the analyzer.

# Note:
Mention of trade names or specific products does not constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.
4.1.3

A heated three-way valve assembly to direct the zero and calibration gases to the analyzer is recommended. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route calibration gas to the analyzers are applicable.
4.1.4
Particulate Filter.
An in-stack or out-of-stack sintered stainless steel filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated.
4.1.5
Fuel.
The fuel specified by the manufacturer (e.g., 40 percent hydrogen/60 percent helium, 40 percent hydrogen/60 percent nitrogen gas mixtures, or pure hydrogen) should be used.
4.1.6

High purity air with less than 0.1 parts per million by volume (ppm) HC as methane or carbon equivalent or less than 0.1 percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
4.1.7
Calibration Gases.
Appropriate concentrations of propane gas (in air or nitrogen). Preparation of the calibration gases should be done according to the procedures in EPA Protocol 1. In addition, the manufacturer of the cylinder gas should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change by more than ±2 percent from the certified value.
4.2
CEMS Span Value.
100 ppm propane. The span value must be documented by the CEMS manufacturer with laboratory data.
4.3
Daily Calibration Gas Values.
The owner or operator must choose calibration gas concentrations that include zero and high-level calibration values.
4.3.1 The zero level may be between zero and 0.1 ppm (zero and 0.1 percent of the span value).
4.3.2 The high-level concentration must be between 50 and 90 ppm (50 and 90 percent of the span value).
4.4
Data Recorder Scale.
The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be capable of recording all readings within the CEMS' measurement range and must have a resolution of 0.5 ppm (0.5 percent of span value).
4.5
Response Time.
The response time for the CEMS must not exceed 2 minutes to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.
4.6
Calibration Drift.
The CEMS must allow the determination of CD at the zero and high-level values. The CEMS calibration response must not differ by more than ±3 ppm (±3 percent of the span value) after each 24-hour period of the 7-day test at both zero and high levels.
4.7
Calibration Error.
The mean difference between the CEMS and reference values at all three test points listed below must be no greater than 5 ppm (±5 percent of the span value).

Zero Level.
Zero to 0.1 ppm (0 to 0.1 percent of span value).
4.7.2
Mid-Level.
30 to 40 ppm (30 to 40 percent of span value).
4.7.3
High-Level.
70 to 80 ppm (70 to 80 percent of span value).
4.8
Measurement and Recording Frequency.
The sample to be analyzed must pass through the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption. The detector must measure the sample concentration at least once every 15 seconds. An average emission rate must be computed and recorded at least once every 60 seconds.
4.9
Hourly Rolling Average Calculation.
The CEMS must calculate every minute an hourly rolling average, which is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values.
4.10
Retest.
If the CEMS produces results within the specified criteria, the test is successful. If the CEMS does not meet one or more of the criteria, necessary corrections must be made and the performance tests repeated.

# 5. Performance Specification Test (PST) Periods
5.1
Pretest Preparation Period.
Install the CEMS, prepare the PTM test site according to the specifications in section 3, and prepare the CEMS for operation and calibration according to the manufacturer's written instructions. A pretest conditioning period similar to that of the 7-day CD test is recommended to verify the operational status of the CEMS.
5.2
Calibration Drift Test Period.
While the facility is operating under normal conditions, determine the magnitude of the CD at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days according to the procedure given in section 6.1. All CD determinations must be made following a 24-hour period during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. If the combustion unit is taken out of service during the test period, record the onset and duration of the downtime and continue the CD test when the unit resumes operation.
5.3
Calibration Error Test and Response Time Test Periods.
Conduct the CE and response time tests during the CD test period.

# 6. Performance Specification Test Procedures
6.1
Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) and Absolute Calibration Audits (ACA).
The test procedures described in this section are in lieu of a RATA and ACA.
6.2
Calibration Drift Test.
6.2.1
Sampling Strategy.
Conduct the CD test at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two daily concentration levels specified in section 4.3. Introduce the two calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas must pass through all CEM components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences may exceed 3 percent of the span of the CEM.
6.2.2
Calculations.
Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 1. Calculate the differences between the CEMS responses and the reference values.
6.3
Response Time.
The entire system including sample extraction and transport, sample conditioning, gas analyses, and the data recording is checked with this procedure.
6.3.1 Introduce the calibration gases at the probe as near to the sample location as possible. Introduce the zero gas into the system. When the system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of full scale for 30 sec), switch to monitor stack effluent and wait for a stable value. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percent of the final stable value.
6.3.2 Next, introduce a high-level calibration gas and repeat the above procedure. Repeat the entire procedure three times and determine the mean upscale and downscale response times. The longer of the two means is the system response time.
6.4
Calibration Error Test Procedure.
6.4.1
Sampling Strategy.
Challenge the CEMS with zero gas and EPA Protocol 1 cylinder gases at measurement points within the ranges specified in section 4.7.
6.4.1.1 The daily calibration gases, if Protocol 1, may be used for this test.
ER30SE99.011
6.4.1.2 Operate the CEMS as nearly as possible in its normal sampling mode. The calibration gas should be injected into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical and must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling. Challenge the CEMS three non-consecutive times at each measurement point and record the responses. The duration of each gas injection should be for a sufficient period of time to ensure that the CEMS surfaces are conditioned.
6.4.2
Calculations.
Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example data sheet is shown in Figure 2. Average the differences between the instrument response and the certified cylinder gas value for each gas. Calculate three CE results according to Equation 1. No confidence coefficient is used in CE calculations.

# 7. Equations

# Performance Specification 9—Specifications and Test Procedures for Gas Chromatographic Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Applicability. These requirements apply to continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) that use gas chromatography (GC) to measure gaseous organic compound emissions. The requirements include procedures intended to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation and whenever specified in regulations or permits. Quality assurance procedures for calibrating, maintaining, and operating the CEMS properly at all times are also given in this procedure.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
2.1 Calibration precision, calibration error, and performance audit tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with these specifications. Daily calibration and maintenance requirements are also specified.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). That portion of the system that separates and detects organic analytes and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration. The GC must be temperature controlled.

# Note:
The term temperature controlled refers to the ability to maintain a certain temperature around the column. Temperature-programmable GC is not required for this performance specification, as long as all other requirements for precision, linearity and accuracy listed in this performance specification are met. It should be noted that temperature programming a GC will speed up peak elution, thus allowing increased sampling frequency.
3.1.1 Column. Analytical column capable of separating the analytes of interest.
3.1.2 Detector. A detection system capable of detecting and quantifying all analytes of interest.
3.1.3 Integrator. That portion of the system that quantifies the area under a particular sample peak generated by the GC.
3.1.4 Data Recorder. A strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder capable of recording all readings within the instrument's calibration range.
3.2 Calibration Precision. The error between triplicate injections of each calibration standard.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the application regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the reference method should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Presurvey Sample Analysis and GC Selection. Determine the pollutants to be monitored from the applicable regulation or permit and determine the approximate concentration of each pollutant (this information can be based on past compliance test results). Select an appropriate GC configuration to measure the organic compounds. The GC components should include a heated sample injection loop (or other sample introduction systems), separatory column, temperature-controlled oven, and detector. If the source chooses dual column and/or dual detector configurations, each column/detector is considered a separate instrument for the purpose of this performance specification and thus the procedures in this performance specification shall be carried out on each system. If this method is applied in highly explosive areas, caution should be exercised in selecting the equipment and method of installation.
6.2 Sampling System. The sampling system shall be heat traced and maintained at a minimum of 120 °C with no cold spots. All system components shall be heated, including the probe, calibration valve, sample lines, sampling loop (or sample introduction system), GC oven, and the detector block (when appropriate for the type of detector being utilized,
e.g.,
flame ionization detector).

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Calibration Gases. Obtain three concentrations of calibration gases certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 2 percent of the value on the label. A gas dilution system may be used to prepare the calibration gases from a high concentration certified standard if the gas dilution system meets the requirements specified in Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M. The performance test specified in Test Method 205 shall be repeated quarterly, and the results of the Method 205 test shall be included in the report. The calibration gas concentration of each target analyte shall be as follows (measured concentration is based on the presurvey concentration determined in section 6.1).

# Note:
If the low level calibration gas concentration falls at or below the limit of detection for the instrument for any target pollutant, a calibration gas with a concentration at 4 to 5 times the limit of detection for the instrument may be substituted for the low-level calibration gas listed in section 7.1.1.
7.1.1 Low-level. 40-60 percent of measured concentration.
7.1.2 Mid-level. 90-110 percent of measured concentration.
7.1.3 High-level. 140-160 percent of measured concentration, or select highest expected concentration.
7.2 Performance Audit Gas. Performance Audit Gas is an independent cylinder gas or cylinder gas mixture. A certified EPA audit gas shall be used, when possible. A gas mixture containing all the target compounds within the calibration range and certified by EPA's Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards may be used when EPA performance audit materials are not available. If a certified EPA audit gas or a traceability protocol gas is not available, use a gas manufacturer standard accurate to 2 percent.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications. Install the CEMs in a location where the measurements are representative of the source emissions. Consider other factors, such as ease of access for calibration and maintenance purposes. The location should not be close to air in-leakages. The sampling location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs. The location should be at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. To calculate equivalent duct diameter, see section 12.2 of Method 1 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Sampling locations not conforming to the requirements in this section may be used if necessary upon approval of the Administrator.
8.2 Pretest Preparation Period. Using the procedures described in Method 18
(40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), perform initial tests to determine GC conditions that provide good resolution and minimum analysis time for compounds of interest. Resolution interferences that may occur can be eliminated by appropriate GC column and detector choice or by shifting the retention times through changes in the column flow rate and the use of temperature programming.
8.3 Seven (7)-Day Calibration Error (CE) Test Period. At the beginning of each 24-hour period, set the initial instrument set points by conducting a multi-point calibration for each compound. The multi-point calibration shall meet the requirements in sections 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3. Throughout the 24-hour period, sample and analyze the stack gas at the sampling intervals prescribed in the regulation or permit. At the end of the 24-hour period, inject the calibration gases at three concentrations for each compound in triplicate and determine the average instrument response. Determine the CE for each pollutant at each concentration using Equation 9-2. Each CE shall be ≤10 percent. Repeat this procedure six more times for a total of 7 consecutive days.
8.4 Performance Audit Test Periods. Conduct the performance audit once during the initial 7-day CE test and quarterly thereafter. Performance Audit Tests must be conducted through the entire sampling and analyzer system. Sample and analyze the EPA audit gas(es) (or the gas mixture) three times. Calculate the average instrument response. Results from the performance audit test must meet the requirements in sections 13.3 and 13.4.
8.5 Reporting. Follow the reporting requirements of the applicable regulation or permit. If the reporting requirements include the results of this performance specification, summarize in tabular form the results of the CE tests. Include all data sheets, calculations, CEMS data records, performance audit results, and calibration gas concentrations and certifications.

# Performance Specification 11—Specifications and Test Procedures for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 What Are the Purpose and Applicability of Performance Specification 11?
The purpose of Performance Specification 11 (PS-11) is to establish the initial installation and performance procedures that are required for evaluating the acceptability of a particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS); it is not to evaluate the ongoing performance of your PM CEMS over an extended period of time, nor to identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance. You will find procedures for evaluating the ongoing performance of a PM CEMS in Procedure 2 of Appendix F—Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used at Stationary Sources.
1.1 Under what conditions does PS-11 apply to my PM CEMS? The PS-11 applies to your
PM CEMS if you are required by any provision of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to install and operate PM CEMS.
1.2 When must I comply with PS-11? You must comply with PS-11 when directed by the applicable rule that requires you to install and operate a PM CEMS.
1.3 What other monitoring must I perform? To report your PM emissions in units of the emission standard, you may need to monitor additional parameters to correct the PM concentration reported by your PM CEMS. Your CEMS may include the components listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section:
(1) A diluent monitor (
i.e.,
O
2
, CO
2
, or other CEMS specified in the applicable regulation), which must meet its own performance specifications (also found in this appendix),
(2) Auxiliary monitoring equipment to allow measurement, determination, or input of the flue gas temperature, pressure, moisture content, and/or dry volume of stack effluent sampled, and
(3) An automatic sampling system. The performance of your PM CEMS and the establishment of its correlation to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of mass concentration as measured by your PM CEMS (
e.g.,
milligrams per actual cubic meter (mg/acm) or milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm)).

# 2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of PS-11?
The PS-11 requires you to perform initial installation and calibration procedures that confirm the acceptability of your CEMS when it is installed and placed into operation. You must develop a site-specific correlation of your PM CEMS response against manual gravimetric reference method measurements (including those made using EPA Methods 5, 5I, or 17).
2.1 What types of PM CEMS technologies are covered? Several different types of PM CEMS technologies (
e.g.,
light scattering, Beta attenuation, etc.) can be designed with in-situ or extractive sample gas handling systems. Each PM CEMS technology and sample gas handling technology has certain site-specific advantages. You should select and install a PM CEMS that is appropriate for the flue gas conditions at your source.
2.2 How is PS-11 different from other performance specifications? The PS-11 is based on a technique of correlating PM CEMS responses relative to emission concentrations determined by the reference method. This technique is called “the correlation.” This differs from CEMS used to measure gaseous pollutants that have available calibration gases of known concentration. Because the type and characteristics of PM vary from source to source, a single PM correlation, applicable to all sources, is not possible.
2.3 How are the correlation data handled? You must carefully review your manual reference method data and your PM CEMS responses to include only valid, high-quality data. For the correlation, you must convert the manual reference method data to measurement conditions (
e.g.,
wet or dry basis) that are consistent with your PM CEMS. Then, you must correlate the manual method and PM CEMS data in terms of the output as received from the monitor (
e.g.,
milliamps). At the appropriate PM CEMS response specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification, you must calculate the confidence interval half range and tolerance interval half range as a percentage of the applicable PM concentration emission limit and compare the confidence interval and tolerance interval percentages with the performance criteria. Also, you must calculate the correlation coefficient and compare the correlation coefficient with the applicable performance criterion specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification.
Situations may arise where you will need two or more correlations. If you need multiple correlations, you must collect sufficient data for each correlation, and each correlation must satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification.
2.4 How do I design my PM CEMS correlation program? When planning your PM CEMS correlation effort, you must address each of the items in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this section to enhance the probability of success. You will find each of these elements further described in this performance specification or in the applicable reference method procedure.
(1) What type of PM CEMS should I select? You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for your source with technical consideration for potential factors such as interferences, site-specific configurations, installation location, flue gas conditions, PM concentration range, and other PM characteristics. You can find guidance on which technology is best suited for specific situations in our report “Current Knowledge of Particulate Matter (PM) Continuous Emission Monitoring” (PM CEMS Knowledge Document, see section 16.5).
(2) Where should I install my PM CEMS? Your PM CEMS must be installed in a location that is most representative of PM emissions, as determined by the reference method, such that the correlation between PM CEMS response and emissions determined by the reference method will meet these performance specifications. Care must be taken in selecting a location and measurement point to minimize problems due to flow disturbances, cyclonic flow, and varying PM stratification.
(3) How should I record my CEMS data? You need to ensure that your PM CEMS and data logger are set up to collect and record all normal emission levels and excursions. You must ensure that your data logger and PM CEMS have been properly programmed to accept and transfer status signals of valid monitor operation (
e.g.,
flags for internal calibration, suspect data, or maintenance periods).
(4) What CEMS data should I review? You must review drift data daily to document proper operation. You must also ensure that any audit material is appropriate for the typical operating range of your PM CEMS.
(5) How long should I operate my PM CEMS before conducting the initial correlation test? You should allow sufficient time for your PM CEMS to operate for you to become familiar with your PM CEMS.
(i) You should observe PM CEMS response over time during normal and varying process conditions. This will ensure that your PM CEMS has been properly set up to operate at a range that is compatible with the concentrations and characteristics of PM emissions for your source. You should use this information to establish the range of operating conditions necessary to determine the correlations of PM CEMS data to manual reference method measurements over a wide operating range.
(ii) You must determine the types of process changes that will influence, on a definable and repeatable basis, flue gas PM concentrations and the resulting PM CEMS responses. You may find this period useful to make adjustments to your planned approach for operating your PM CEMS at your source. For instance, you may change the measurement range or batch sampling period to something other than those you initially planned to use.
(6) How do I conduct the initial correlation test? When conducting the initial correlation test of your PM CEMS response to PM emissions determined by the reference method, you must pay close attention to accuracy and details. Your PM CEMS must be operating properly. You must perform the manual reference method testing accurately, with attention to eliminating site-specific systemic errors. You must coordinate the timing of the manual reference method testing with the sampling cycle of your PM CEMS. You must complete a minimum of 15 manual reference method tests. You must perform the manual reference method testing over the full range of PM CEMS responses that correspond to normal operating conditions for your source and control device and will result in the widest range of emission concentrations.
(7) How should I perform the manual reference method testing? You must perform the manual reference method testing in accordance with specific rule requirements, coordinated closely with PM CEMS and process operations. It is highly recommended that you use paired trains for the manual reference method testing. You must perform the manual reference method testing over a suitable PM concentration range that corresponds to the full range of normal process and control device operating conditions. Because the manual reference method testing for this correlation test is not for compliance reporting purposes, you may conduct the reference method test runs for less than the typical minimum test run duration of 1 hour.
(8) What do I do with the manual reference method data and PM CEMS data? You must complete each of the activities in paragraphs (8)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) Screen the manual reference method data for validity (
e.g.,
isokinetics, leak checks), quality assurance, and quality control (
e.g.,
outlier identification).
(ii) Screen your PM CEMS data for validity (
e.g.,
daily drift check requirements) and quality assurance (
e.g.,
flagged data).
(iii) Convert the manual reference method test data into measurement units (
e.g.,
mg/acm) consistent with the measurement conditions of your PM CEMS.
(iv) Calculate the correlation equation(s) as specified in section 12.3.
(v) Calculate the correlation coefficient, confidence interval half range, and tolerance interval half range for the complete set of PM CEMS and reference method correlation data for comparison with the correlation performance criteria specified in section 13.2.
2.5 What other procedures must I perform? Before conducting the initial correlation test, you must successfully complete a 7-day drift test (See section 8.5).

3.17 “Paired Trains” means two reference method trains that are used to conduct simultaneous measurements of PM concentrations. Guidance on the use of paired sampling trains can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5).
3.18 “Polynomial Correlation” means a second-order equation used to define the relationship between your PM CEMS output and reference method PM concentration, as indicated by Equation 11-16.
3.19 “Power Correlation” means an equation used to define a power function relationship between your PM CEMS output and the reference method concentration, as indicated by Equation 11-42.
3.20 “Reference Method” means the method defined in the applicable regulations, but commonly refers to those methods collectively known as EPA Methods 5, 5I, and 17 (for particulate matter), found in Appendix A of 40 CFR 60. Only the front half and dry filter catch portions of the reference method can be correlated to your PM CEMS output.
3.21 “Reference Standard” means a reference material or procedure that produces a known and unchanging response when presented to the pollutant monitor portion of your CEMS. You must use these standards to evaluate the overall operation of your PM CEMS, but not to develop a PM CEMS correlation.
3.22 “Response Time” means the time interval between the start of a step change in the system input and the time when the pollutant monitor output reaches 95 percent of the final value (see sections 6.5 and 13.3 for procedures and acceptance criteria).
3.23 “Sample Interface” means the portion of your CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample delivery, sample conditioning, or protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
3.24 “Sample Volume Check” means a check of the difference between your PM CEMS sample volume reading and the sample volume reference value.
3.25 “Tolerance Interval half range (TI)” means one-half of the width of the tolerance interval with upper and lower limits, within which a specified percentage of the future data population is contained with a given level of confidence, as defined by the respective tolerance interval half range equations in section 12.3(1)(iii) for linear correlations and in section 12.3(2)(iii) for polynomial correlations. The TI as a percent of the emission limit value (TI%) is calculated at the appropriate PM CEMS response value specified in section 13.2(3).
3.26 “Upscale Check Value” means the expected response to a reference standard or procedure used to check the upscale response of your PM CEMS.

3.30 “Zero Point Correlation Value” means a value added to PM CEMS correlation data to represent low or near zero PM concentration data (see section 8.6 for rationale and procedures).

# 4.0 Are There Any Potential Interferences for My PM CEMS?
Yes, condensible water droplets or condensible acid gas aerosols (
i.e.,
those with condensation temperatures above those specified by the reference method) at the measurement location can be interferences for your PM CEMS if the necessary precautions are not met.
4.1 Where are interferences likely to occur? Interferences may develop if your CEMS is installed downstream of a wet air pollution control system or any other conditions that produce flue gases, which, at your PM CEMS measurement point, normally or occasionally contain entrained water droplets or condensible salts before release to the atmosphere.
4.2 How do I deal with interferences? We recommend that you use a PM CEMS that extracts and heats representative samples of the flue gas for measurement to simulate results produced by the reference method for conditions such as those described in section 4.1. Independent of your PM CEMS measurement technology and extractive technique, you should have a configuration simulating the reference method to ensure that:
(1) No formation of new PM or deposition of PM occurs in sample delivery from the stack or duct; and
(2) No condensate accumulates in the sample flow measurement apparatus.
4.3 What PM CEMS measurement technologies should I use? You should use a PM CEMS measurement technology that is free of interferences from any condensible constituent in the flue gas.

# 5.0 What Do I Need To Know To Ensure the Safety of Persons Using PS-11?
People using the procedures required under PS-11 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations, site conditions, and equipment. This performance specification does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing these procedures. You must consult your CEMS user's manual and other reference materials recommended by the reference method for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 What Equipment and Supplies Do I Need?
Different types of PM CEMS use different operating principles. You should select an appropriate PM CEMS based on your site-specific configurations, flue gas conditions, and PM characteristics.
(1) Your PM CEMS must sample the stack effluent continuously or, for batch sampling PM CEMS, intermittently.
(2) You must ensure that the averaging time, the number of measurements in an average, the minimum data availability, and the averaging procedure for your CEMS conform with those specified in the applicable emission regulation.
(3) Your PM CEMS must include, as a minimum, the equipment described in sections 6.1 through 6.7.
6.1 What equipment is needed for my PM CEMS's sample interface? Your PM CEMS's sample interface must be capable of delivering a representative sample of the flue gas to your PM CEMS. This subsystem may be required to heat the sample gas to avoid PM deposition or moisture condensation, provide dilution air, perform other gas conditioning
to prepare the sample for analysis, or measure the sample volume or flow rate.
(1) If your PM CEMS is installed downstream of a wet air pollution control system such that the flue gases normally or occasionally contain entrained water droplets, we recommend that you select a sampling system that includes equipment to extract and heat a representative sample of the flue gas for measurement so that the pollutant monitor portion of your CEMS measures only dry PM. Heating should be sufficient to raise the temperature of the extracted flue gas above the water condensation temperature and should be maintained at all times and at all points in the sample line from where the flue gas is extracted, including the pollutant monitor and any sample flow measurement devices.
(2) You must consider the measured conditions of the sample gas stream to ensure that manual reference method test data are converted to units of PM concentration that are appropriate for the correlation calculations. Additionally, you must identify what, if any, additional auxiliary data from other monitoring and handling systems are necessary to convert your PM CEMS response into the units of the PM standard.
(3) If your PM CEMS is an extractive type and your source's flue gas volumetric flow rate varies by more than 10 percent from nominal, your PM CEMS should maintain an isokinetic sampling rate (within 10 percent of true isokinetic). If your extractive-type PM CEMS does not maintain an isokinetic sampling rate, you must use actual site-specific data or data from a similar installation to prove to us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency that isokinetic sampling is not necessary.
6.2 What type of equipment is needed for my PM CEMS? Your PM CEMS must be capable of providing an electronic output that can be correlated to the PM concentration.
(1) Your PM CEMS must be able to perform zero and upscale drift checks. You may perform these checks manually, but performing these checks automatically is preferred.
(2) We recommend that you select a PM CEMS that is capable of performing automatic diagnostic checks and sending instrument status signals (flags) to the data recorder.
(3) If your PM CEMS is an extractive type that measures the sample volume and uses the measured sample volume as part of calculating the output value, your PM CEMS must be able to perform a check of the sample volume to verify the accuracy of the sample volume measuring equipment. The sample volume check must be conducted daily and at the normal sampling rate of your PM CEMS.
6.3 What is the appropriate measurement range for my PM CEMS? Initially, your PM CEMS must be set up to measure over the expected range of your source's PM emission concentrations during routine operations. You may change the measurement range to a more appropriate range prior to correlation testing.
6.4 What if my PM CEMS does automatic range switching? Your PM CEMS may be equipped to perform automatic range switching so that it is operating in a range most sensitive to the detected concentrations. If your PM CEMS does automatic range switching, you must configure the data recorder to handle the recording of data values in multiple ranges during range-switching intervals.
6.5 What averaging time and sample intervals should be used? Your CEMS must sample the stack effluent such that the averaging time, the number of measurements in an average, the minimum sampling time, and the averaging procedure for reporting and determining compliance conform with those specified in the applicable regulation. Your PM CEMS must be designed to meet the specified response time and cycle time established in this performance specification (see section 13.3).
6.6 What type of equipment is needed for my data recorder? Your CEMS data recorder must be able to accept and record electronic signals from all the monitors associated with your PM CEMS.
(1) Your data recorder must record the signals from your PM CEMS that can be correlated to PM mass concentrations. If your PM CEMS uses multiple ranges, your data recorder must identify what range the measurement was made in and provide range-adjusted results.
(2) Your data recorder must accept and record monitor status signals (flagged data).
(3) Your data recorder must accept signals from auxiliary data monitors, as appropriate.
6.7 What other equipment and supplies might I need? You may need other supporting equipment as defined by the applicable reference method(s) (see section 7) or as specified by your CEMS manufacturer.

# 7.0 What Reagents and Standards Do I Need?
You will need reference standards or procedures to perform the zero drift check, the upscale drift check, and the sample volume check.
7.1 What is the reference standard value for the zero drift check? You must use a zero check value that is no greater than 20 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. You must obtain documentation on the zero check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.
7.2 What is the reference standard value for the upscale drift check? You must use an upscale check value that produces a response between 50 and 100 percent of the PM CEMS's
response range. For a PM CEMS that produces output over a range of 4 mA to 20 mA, the upscale check value must produce a response in the range of 12 mA to 20 mA. You must obtain documentation on the upscale check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.
7.3 What is the reference standard value for the sample volume check? You must use a reference standard value or procedure that produces a sample volume value equivalent to the normal sampling rate. You must obtain documentation on the sample volume value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.

# 8.0 What Performance Specification Test Procedure Do I Follow?
You must complete each of the activities in sections 8.1 through 8.8 for your performance specification test.
8.1 How should I select and set up my equipment? You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for your source, giving consideration to potential factors such as flue gas conditions, interferences, site-specific configuration, installation location, PM concentration range, and other PM characteristics. Your PM CEMS must meet the equipment specifications in sections 6.1 and 6.2.
(1) You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for the flue gas conditions at your source. If your source's flue gas contains entrained water droplets, we recommend that your PM CEMS include a sample delivery and conditioning system that is capable of extracting and heating a representative sample.
(i) Your PM CEMS must maintain the sample at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation in the sample line before analysis of PM.
(ii) If condensible PM is an issue, we recommend that you operate your PM CEMS to maintain the sample gas temperature at the same temperature as the reference method filter.
(iii) Your PM CEMS must avoid condensation in the sample flow rate measurement lines.
(2) Some PM CEMS do not have a wide measurement range capability. Therefore, you must select a PM CEMS that is capable of measuring the full range of PM concentrations expected from your source from normal levels through the emission limit concentration.
(3) Some PM CEMS are sensitive to particle size changes, water droplets in the gas stream, particle charge, stack gas velocity changes, or other factors. Therefore, you should select a PM CEMS appropriate for the emission characteristics of your source.
(4) We recommend that you consult your PM CEMS vendor to obtain basic recommendations on the instrument capabilities and setup configuration. You are ultimately responsible for setup and operation of your PM CEMS.
8.2 Where do I install my PM CEMS? You must install your PM CEMS at an accessible location downstream of all pollution control equipment. You must perform your PM CEMS concentration measurements from a location considered representative or be able to provide data that can be corrected to be representative of the total PM emissions as determined by the manual reference method.
(1) You must select a measurement location that minimizes problems due to flow disturbances, cyclonic flow, and varying PM stratification (refer to Method 1 for guidance).
(2) If you plan to achieve higher emissions for correlation test purposes by adjusting the performance of the air pollution control device (per section 8.6(4)(i)), you must locate your PM CEMS and reference method sampling points well downstream of the control device (
e.g.,
downstream of the induced draft fan), in order to minimize PM stratification that may be created in these cases.
8.3 How do I select the reference method measurement location and traverse points? You must follow EPA Method 1 for identifying manual reference method traverse points. Ideally, you should perform your manual reference method measurements at locations that satisfy the measurement site selection criteria specified in EPA Method 1 of at least eight duct diameters downstream and at least two duct diameters upstream of any flow disturbance. Where necessary, you may conduct testing at a location that is two diameters downstream and 0.5 diameters upstream of flow disturbances. If your location does not meet the minimum downstream and upstream requirements, you must obtain approval from us to test at your location.
8.4 What are my pretest preparation steps? You must install your CEMS and prepare the reference method test site according to the specifications in sections 8.2 and 8.3.
(1) After completing the initial field installation, we recommend that you operate your PM CEMS according to the manufacturer's instructions to familiarize yourself with its operation before you begin correlation testing.
(i) During this initial period of operation, we recommend that you conduct daily checks (zero and upscale drift and sample volume, as appropriate), and, when any check exceeds the daily specification (see section 13.1), make adjustments and perform any necessary maintenance to ensure reliable operation.
(2) When you are confident that your PM CEMS is operating properly, we recommend that you operate your CEMS over a correlation test planning period of sufficient duration to identify the full range of operating
conditions and PM emissions to be used in your PM CEMS correlation test.
(i) During the correlation test planning period, you should operate the process and air pollution control equipment over the normal range of operating conditions, except when you attempt to produce higher emissions.
(ii) Your data recorder should record PM CEMS response during the full range of routine process operating conditions.
(iii) You should try to establish the relationships between operating conditions and PM CEMS response, especially those conditions that produce the highest PM CEMS response over 15-minute averaging periods, and the lowest PM CEMS response as well. The objective is to be able to reproduce the conditions for purposes of the actual correlation testing discussed in section 8.6.
(3) You must set the response range of your PM CEMS such that the instrument measures the full range of responses that correspond to the range of source operating conditions that you will implement during correlation testing.
(4) We recommend that you perform preliminary reference method testing after the correlation test planning period. During this preliminary testing, you should measure the PM emission concentration corresponding to the highest PM CEMS response observed during the full range of normal operation, when perturbing the control equipment, or as the result of PM spiking.
(5) Before performing correlation testing, you must perform a 7-day zero and upscale drift test (see section 8.5).
(6) You must not change the response range of the monitor once the response range has been set and the drift test successfully completed.
8.5 How do I perform the 7-day drift test? You must check the zero (or low-level value between 0 and 20 percent of the response range of the instrument) and upscale (between 50 and 100 percent of the instrument's response range) drift. You must perform this check at least once daily over 7 consecutive days. Your PM CEMS must quantify and record the zero and upscale measurements and the time of the measurements. If you make automatic or manual adjustments to your PM CEMS zero and upscale settings, you must conduct the drift test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that you can determine the amount of drift. You will find the calculation procedures for drift in section 12.1 and the acceptance criteria for allowable drift in section 13.1.
(1) What is the purpose of 7-day drift tests? The purpose of the 7-day drift test is to demonstrate that your system is capable of operating in a stable manner and maintaining its calibration for at least a 7-day period.
(2) How do I conduct the 7-day drift test? To conduct the 7-day drift test, you must determine the magnitude of the drift once each day, at 24-hour intervals, for 7 consecutive days while your source is operating normally.
(i) You must conduct the 7-day drift test at the two points specified in section 8.5. You may perform the 7-day drift tests automatically or manually by introducing to your PM CEMS suitable reference standards (these need not be certified) or by using other appropriate procedures.
(ii) You must record your PM CEMS zero and upscale response and evaluate them against the zero check value and upscale check value.
(3) When must I conduct the 7-day drift test? You must complete a valid 7-day drift test before attempting the correlation test.
8.6 How do I conduct my PM CEMS correlation test? You must conduct the correlation test according to the procedure given in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section. If you need multiple correlations, you must conduct testing and collect at least 15 sets of reference method and PM CEMS data for calculating each separate correlation.
(1) You must use the reference method for PM (usually EPA Methods 5, 5I, or 17) that is prescribed by the applicable regulations. You may need to perform other reference methods or performance specifications (
e.g.,
Method 3 for oxygen, Method 4 for moisture, etc.) depending on the units in which your PM CEMS reports PM concentration.
(i) We recommend that you use paired reference method trains when collecting manual PM data to identify and screen the reference method data for imprecision and bias. Procedures for checking reference method data for bias and precision can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5).
(ii) You may use test runs that are shorter than 60 minutes in duration (
e.g.,
20 or 30 minutes). You may perform your PM CEMS correlation tests during new source performance standards performance tests or other compliance tests subject to the Clean Air Act or other statutes, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In these cases, your reference method results obtained during the PM CEMS correlation test may be used to determine compliance so long as your source and the test conditions and procedures (
e.g.,
reference method sample run durations) are consistent with the applicable regulations and the reference method.
(iii) You must convert the reference method results to units consistent with the conditions of your PM CEMS measurements. For example, if your PM CEMS measures and reports PM emissions in the units of mass per actual volume of stack gas, you must convert your reference method results to those units (
e.g.,
mg/acm). If your PM CEMS extracts and heats the sample gas to eliminate
water droplets, then measures and reports PM emissions under those actual conditions, you must convert your reference method results to those same conditions (
e.g.,
mg/acm at 160 °C).
(2) During each test run, you must coordinate process operations, reference method sampling, and PM CEMS operations. For example, you must ensure that the process is operating at the targeted conditions, both reference method trains are sampling simultaneously (if paired sampling trains are being used), and your PM CEMS and data logger are operating properly.
(i) You must coordinate the start and stop times of each run between the reference method sampling and PM CEMS operation. For a batch sampling PM CEMS, you must start the reference method at the same time as your PM CEMS sampling.
(ii) You must note the times for port changes (and other periods when the reference method sampling may be suspended) on the data sheets so that you can adjust your PM CEMS data accordingly, if necessary.
(iii) You must properly align the time periods for your PM CEMS and your reference method measurements to account for your PM CEMS response time.
(3) You must conduct a minimum of 15 valid runs each consisting of simultaneous PM CEMS and reference method measurement sets.
(i) You may conduct more than 15 sets of CEMS and reference method measurements. If you choose this option, you may reject certain test results so long as the total number of valid test results you use to determine the correlation is greater than or equal to 15.
(ii) You must report all data, including the rejected data.
(iii) You may reject the results of up to five test runs without explanation.
(iv) If you reject the results of more than five test runs, the basis for rejecting the results of the additional test runs must be explicitly stated in the reference method, this performance specification, Procedure 2 of appendix F, or your quality assurance plan.
(4) Simultaneous PM CEMS and reference method measurements must be performed in a manner to ensure that the range of data that will be used to establish the correlation for your PM CEMS is maximized. You must first attempt to maximize your correlation range by following the procedures described in paragraphs (4)(i) through (iv) of this section. If you cannot obtain the three levels as described in paragraphs (i) through (iv), then you must use the procedure described in section 8.6(5).
(i) You must attempt to obtain the three different levels of PM mass concentration by varying process operating conditions, varying PM control device conditions, or by means of PM spiking.
(ii) The three PM concentration levels you use in the correlation tests must be distributed over the complete operating range experienced by your source.
(iii) At least 20 percent of the minimum 15 measured data points you use should be contained in each of the following levels:
• Level 1: From no PM (zero concentration) emissions to 50 percent of the maximum PM concentration;
• Level 2: 25 to 75 percent of the maximum PM concentration; and
• Level 3: 50 to 100 percent of the maximum PM concentration.
(iv) Although the above levels overlap, you may only apply individual run data to one level.
(5) If you cannot obtain three distinct levels of PM concentration as described, you must perform correlation testing over the maximum range of PM concentrations that is practical for your PM CEMS. To ensure that the range of data used to establish the correlation for your PM CEMS is maximized, you must follow one or more of the steps in paragraphs (5)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Zero point data for
in-situ
instruments should be obtained, to the extent possible, by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.
(ii) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.
(iii) Zero point data also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (
e.g.,
when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas).
(iv) If none of the steps in paragraphs (5)(i) through (iii) of this section are possible, you must estimate the monitor response when no PM is in the flue gas (
e.g.,
4 mA = 0 mg/acm).
8.7 What do I do with the initial correlation test data for my PM CEMS? You must calculate and report the results of the correlation testing, including the correlation coefficient, confidence interval, and tolerance interval for the PM CEMS response and reference method correlation data that are use to establish the correlation, as specified in section 12. You must include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of PM CEMS responses), process data records including PM control equipment operating parameters, and reference media certifications necessary to confirm that your PM CEMS met the requirements of this performance specification. In addition, you must:
(1) Determine the integrated (arithmetic average) PM CEMS output over each reference method test period;
(2) Adjust your PM CEMS outputs and reference method test data to the same clock
time (considering response time of your PM CEMS);
(3) Confirm that the reference method results are consistent with your PM CEMS response in terms of, where applicable, moisture, temperature, pressure, and diluent concentrations; and
(4) Determine whether any of the reference method test results do not meet the test method criteria.
8.8 What is the limitation on the range of my PM CEMS correlation? Although the data you collect during the correlation testing should be representative of the full range of normal operating conditions at your source, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section occurs.
(1) If your source is a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the events specified in paragraphs (1)(i) or (ii) of this section occurs while your source is operating under normal conditions.
(i) Your source generates 24 consecutive hourly average PM CEMS responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response (
e.g.,
mA reading) used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, or
(ii) The cumulative hourly average PM CEMS responses generated by your source are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, for more than 5 percent of your PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period.
(2) If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the events specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this section occurs while your source is operating under normal conditions.
(i) Your source generates 24 consecutive hourly average PM CEMS responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response (
e.g.,
mA reading) used for the correlation curve, or
(ii) The cumulative hourly average PM CEMS responses generated by your source are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used for the correlation curve for more than 5 percent of your PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period.
(3) If additional correlation testing is required, you must conduct at least three additional test runs under the conditions that caused the higher PM CEMS response.
(i) You must complete the additional testing and use the resulting new data along with the previous data to calculate a revised correlation equation within 60 days after the occurrence of the event that requires additional testing, as specified in paragraphs 8.8(1) and (2).
(4) If your source generates consecutive PM CEMS hourly responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve for 24 hours or for a cumulative period that amounts to more than 5 percent of the PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period, you must report the reason for the higher PM CEMS responses.

# 9.0 What Quality Control Measures Are Required?
Quality control measures for PM CEMS are specified in 40 CFR 60, Appendix F, Procedure 2.

# 10.0 What Calibration and Standardization Procedures Must I Perform?
[Reserved]

# 11.0 What Analytical Procedures Apply to This Procedure?
Specific analytical procedures are outlined in the applicable reference method(s).

# 12.0 What Calculations and Data Analyses Are Needed?
You must determine the primary relationship for correlating the output from your PM CEMS to a PM concentration, typically in units of mg/acm or mg/dscm of flue gas, using the calculations and data analysis process in sections 12.2 and 12.3. You develop the correlation by performing an appropriate regression analysis between your PM CEMS response and your reference method data.
12.1 How do I calculate upscale drift and zero drift? You must determine the difference in your PM CEMS output readings from the established reference values (zero and upscale check values) after a stated period of operation during which you performed no unscheduled maintenance, repair or adjustment.
(1) Calculate the upscale drift (UD) using Equation 11-1:
ER30AU16.017
Where:
UD = The upscale (high-level) drift of your PM CEMS in percent,
R
CEM
= The measured PM CEMS response to the upscale reference standard,
R
U
= The pre-established numerical value of the upscale reference standard, and
R
r
= The response range of the analyzer.

Where:
ZD = The zero (low-level) drift of your PM CEMS in percent,
R
CEM
= The measured PM CEMS response to the zero reference standard,

L
= The pre-established numerical value of the zero reference standard, and
R
r
= The response range of the analyzer.
(3) Summarize the results on a data sheet similar to that shown in Table 2 (see section 17).
12.2 How do I perform the regression analysis? You must couple each reference method PM concentration measurement, y, in the appropriate units, with an average PM CEMS response, x, over corresponding time periods. You must complete your PM CEMS correlation calculations using data deemed acceptable by quality control procedures identified in 40 CFR 60, Appendix F, Procedure 2.
(1) You must evaluate all flagged or suspect data produced during measurement periods and determine whether they should be excluded from your PM CEMS's average.
(2) You must assure that the reference method and PM CEMS results are on a consistent moisture, temperature, and diluent basis. You must convert the reference method PM concentration measurements (dry standard conditions) to the units of your PM CEMS measurement conditions. The conditions of your PM CEMS measurement are monitor-specific. You must obtain from your PM CEMS vendor or instrument manufacturer the conditions and units of measurement for your PM CEMS.
(i) If your sample gas contains entrained water droplets and your PM CEMS is an extractive system that measures at actual conditions (
i.e.,
wet basis), you must use the measured moisture content determined from the impinger analysis when converting your reference method PM data to PM CEMS conditions; do not use the moisture content calculated from a psychrometric chart based on saturated conditions.
12.3 How do I determine my PM CEMS correlation? To predict PM concentrations from PM CEMS responses, you must use the calculation method of least squares presented in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section. When performing the calculations, each reference method PM concentration measurement must be treated as a discrete data point; if using paired sampling trains, do not average reference method data pairs for any test run.
This performance specification describes procedures for evaluating five types of correlation models: linear, polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power. Procedures for selecting the most appropriate correlation model are presented in section 12.4 of this specification.

correlation coefficient to the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. You can use the linear, logarithmic, exponential, or power correlation model if the model satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. However, to use the polynomial model you first must check that the polynomial correlation curve satisfies the criteria for minimum and maximum values specified in paragraph (3) of this section.
(2) If you develop more than one correlation curve that satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, you should use the correlation curve with the greatest correlation coefficient. If the polynomial model has the greatest correlation coefficient, you first must check that the polynomial correlation curve satisfies the criteria for minimum and maximum values specified in paragraph (3) of this section.
(3) You can use the polynomial model that you develop using the procedures described in section 12.3(2) if the model satisfies the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, and the minimum or maximum value of the polynomial correlation curve does not occur within the expanded data range. The minimum or maximum value of the polynomial correlation curve is the point where the slope of the curve equals zero. To determine if the minimum or maximum value occurs within the expanded data range, follow the procedure described in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Determine if your polynomial correlation curve has a minimum or maximum point by comparing the polynomial coefficient b
2
to zero. If b
2
is less than zero, the curve has a maximum value. If b
2
is greater than zero, the curve has a minimum value. (Note: If b
2
equals zero, the correlation curve is linear.)
(ii) Calculate the minimum value using Equation 11-48.
ER25MR09.106
(iii) If your polynomial correlation curve has a minimum point, you must compare the minimum value to the minimum PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve. If the correlation curve minimum value is less than or equal to the minimum PM CEMS response value, you can use the polynomial correlation curve, provided the correlation curve also satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. If the correlation curve minimum value is greater than the minimum PM CEMS response value, you cannot use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations.
(iv) If your polynomial correlation curve has a maximum, the maximum value must be greater than the allowable extrapolation limit. If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the allowable extrapolation limit is 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve. If your source is a low-emitting source, the allowable extrapolation limit is 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve or the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater. If the polynomial correlation curve maximum value is greater than the extrapolation limit, and the correlation curve satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, you can use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations. If the correlation curve maximum value is less than the extrapolation limit, you cannot use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations.
(4) You may petition the Administrator for alternative solutions or sampling recommendations if the correlation models described in section 12.3 of this specification do not satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification.

# 13.0 What Are the Performance Criteria for My PM CEMS?
You must evaluate your PM CEMS based on the 7-day drift check, the accuracy of the correlation, and the sampling periods and cycle/response time.
13.1 What is the 7-day drift check performance specification? Your daily PM CEMS internal drift checks must demonstrate that the daily drift of your PM CEMS does not deviate from the value of the reference light, optical filter, Beta attenuation signal, or other technology-suitable reference standard by more than 2 percent of the response range. If your CEMS includes diluent and/or auxiliary monitors (for temperature, pressure, and/or moisture) that are employed as a necessary part of this performance specification, you must determine the calibration drift separately for each ancillary monitor in terms of its respective output (see the appropriate performance specification for the diluent CEMS specification). None of the calibration drifts may exceed their individual specification.
13.2 What performance criteria must my PM CEMS correlation satisfy? Your PM CEMS correlation must meet each of the minimum specifications in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Before confidence and tolerance interval half range percentage calculations are made, you must convert the emission limit to the appropriate units of your PM CEMS measurement conditions using the average of emissions gas property
values (
e.g.,
diluent concentration, temperature, pressure, and moisture) measured during the correlation test.
(1) The correlation coefficient must satisfy the criterion specified in paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), whichever applies.
(i) If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the correlation coefficient (r) must be greater than or equal to 0.85.
(ii) If your source is a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the correlation coefficient (r) must be greater than or equal to 0.75.
(2) The confidence interval half range must satisfy the applicable criterion specified in paragraph (2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, based on the type of correlation model.
(i) For linear or logarithmic correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the mean PM CEMS response value from the correlation test must be within 10 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-10 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.
(ii) For polynomial correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the PM CEMS response value from the correlation test that corresponds to the minimum value for Δ must be within 10 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-28 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.
(iii) For exponential or power correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the mean of the logarithm of the PM CEMS response values from the correlation test must be within 10 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-10 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.
(3) The tolerance interval half range must satisfy the applicable criterion specified in paragraph (3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, based on the type of correlation model.
(i) For linear or logarithmic correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the mean PM CEMS response value from the correlation test must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-13 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.
(ii) For polynomial correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the PM CEMS response value from the correlation test that corresponds to the minimum value for Δ must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-32 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.
(iii) For exponential or power correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the mean of the logarithm of the PM CEMS response values from the correlation test must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-13 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.
13.3 What are the sampling periods and cycle/response time? You must document and maintain the response time and any changes in the response time following installation.
(1) If you have a batch sampling PM CEMS, you must evaluate the limits presented in paragraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The response time of your PM CEMS, which is equivalent to the cycle time, must be no longer than 15 minutes. In addition, the delay between the end of the sampling time and reporting of the sample analysis must be no greater than 3 minutes. You must document any changes in the response time following installation.
(ii) The sampling time of your PM CEMS must be no less than 30 percent of the cycle time. If you have a batch sampling PM CEMS, sampling must be continuous except during pauses when the collected pollutant on the capture media is being analyzed and the next capture medium starts collecting a new sample.
13.4 What PM compliance monitoring must I do? You must report your CEMS measurements in the units of the standard expressed in the regulations (
e.g.,
mg/dscm @ 7 percent oxygen, pounds per million Btu (lb/mmBtu), etc.). You may need to install auxiliary data monitoring equipment to convert the units reported by your PM CEMS into units of the PM emission standard.

# Performance Specification 12A—Specifications and Test Procedures for Total Vapor Phase Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor phase mercury (Hg) in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg°, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized forms of gaseous Hg (Hg
+2
), in concentration units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3
).
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of total vapor phase Hg continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) installed at stationary sources at the time of or soon after installation and whenever specified in the regulations. The Hg CEMS must be capable of measuring the total concentration in µg/m
3
of vapor phase Hg, regardless of speciation, and recording that concentration at standard conditions on a wet or dry basis. These specifications do not address measurement of particle bound Hg.
1.2.2 This specification is not designed to evaluate an installed CEMS's performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS's performance. The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial performance evaluation test.
See
§§ 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).
1.2.3 Mercury monitoring approaches not entirely suited to these specifications may be approvable under the alternative monitoring or alternative test method provisions of § 60.13(i) and § 63.8(f) or § 60.8(b)(3) and § 63.7(f), respectively.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
Procedures for determining CEMS relative accuracy, linearity, and calibration drift are outlined. CEMS installation and measurement location specifications, data reduction procedures, and performance criteria are included.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS)
means the total equipment required to measure a pollutant concentration. The system generally consists of the following three major subsystems:
3.2
Sample Interface
means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, and protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
3.3
Hg Analyzer
means that portion of the Hg CEMS that measures the total vapor phase Hg mass concentration and generates a proportional output.
3.4
Data Recorder
means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent electronic record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may provide automatic data reduction and CEMS control capabilities.
3.5
Span Value
means the measurement range as specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement. If the span is not specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement, then it must be a value approximately equivalent to two times the emission standard. Unless otherwise specified, the span value may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.
3.6
Measurement Error Test
means a test procedure in which the accuracy of the concentrations measured by a CEMS at three or more points over its measurement range is evaluated using reference gases. For Hg CEMS, elemental and oxidized Hg (Hg
0
and mercuric chloride, HgCl
2
) gas standards of known concentration are used for this procedure.
3.7
Measurement Error (ME)
means the absolute value of the difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of a reference gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged.
3.8
Calibration Drift (CD)
means the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and either an upscale Hg reference gas or a zero-level Hg reference gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance or repair took place.
3.9
Relative Accuracy Test Procedure
means a test procedure consisting of at least nine test runs, in which the accuracy of the concentrations measured by a CEMS is evaluated by comparison against concurrent measurements made with a reference method (RM). Relative accuracy tests repeated on a regular, on-going basis are referred to as relative accuracy test audits or RATAs.
3.10
Relative Accuracy (RA)
means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant concentrations determined by the CEMS and the values determined by the RM plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for sources with an average RM concentration less than 5.0 micrograms per standard cubic meter (µg/scm), the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean CEMS and RM values.

# 4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the RM should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 CEMS Equipment Specifications.
6.1.1 Data Recorder Scale. The Hg CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of expected Hg concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and the span value.
6.1.2 The Hg CEMS design should also provide for the determination of CD and ME at
a zero value (zero to 20 percent of the span value) and at upscale values (between 50 and 100 percent of the span value). The Hg CEMS must be constructed to permit the introduction of known concentrations of Hg and HgCl
2
separately into the sampling system of the CEMS immediately preceding the sample extraction filtration system such that the entire CEMS can be challenged.
6.2 Reference Gas Delivery System. The reference gas delivery system must be designed so that the flowrate exceeds the sampling system flow requirements of the CEMS and that the gas is delivered to the CEMS at atmospheric pressure.
6.3 Other equipment and supplies, as needed by the reference method used for the Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.
See
section 8.6.2.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Reference Gases. Reference gas standards are required for both elemental and oxidized Hg (Hg and mercuric chloride, HgCl
2
). The use of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable standards and reagents is required. The following gas concentrations are required.
7.1.1 Zero-level. 0 to 20 percent of the span value.
7.1.2 Mid-level. 50 to 60 percent of the span value.
7.1.3 High-level. 80 to 100 percent of the span value.
7.2 Reference gas standards may also be required for the reference methods.
See
section 8.6.2.

# 8.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure
8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.
8.1.1 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location downstream of all pollution control equipment. Place the probe outlet or other sampling interface at a point or location in the stack (or vent) representative of the stack gas concentration of Hg. Since the Hg CEMS sample system normally extracts gas from a single point in the stack, a location that has been shown to be free of stratification for Hg or, alternatively, SO
2
is recommended. If the cause of failure to meet the RA test requirement is determined to be the measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated. Measurement locations and points or paths that are most likely to provide data that will meet the RA requirements are described in sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 below.
8.1.2 Measurement Location. The measurement location should be (1) at least two equivalent diameters downstream of the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation or other point at which a change of pollutant concentration may occur, and (2) at least half an equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part.
8.1.3 Hg CEMS Sample Extraction Point. Use a sample extraction point either (1) no less than 1.0 meter from the stack or duct wall, or (2) within the centroidal velocity traverse area of the stack or duct cross section. This does not apply to cross-stack, in-situ measurement systems.
8.2 Measurement Error (ME) Test Procedure. Sequentially inject each of at least three elemental Hg reference gases (zero, mid-level, and high level, as defined in section 7.1), three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession. At each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the reference gas value. Calculate the measurement error (ME) using Equation 12-1 by expressing the absolute value of the difference between the average CEMS response (A) and the reference gas value (R) as a percentage of the span (
see
example data sheet in Figure 12A-1). For each elemental Hg reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value must not exceed 5 percent of the span value. If this specification is not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding. Repeat the measurement error test procedure using oxidized Hg reference gases. For each oxidized Hg reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value shall not exceed 10 percent of the span value. If this specification is not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding.
ER09SE10.009
8.3 Seven-Day Calibration Drift (CD) Test Procedure.
8.3.1 CD Test Period. While the affected facility is operating normally, or as specified
in an applicable regulation, determine the magnitude of the CD once each day (at 24-hour intervals, to the extent practicable) for 7 consecutive unit operating days according to the procedures in sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3. The 7 consecutive unit operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days. Use either Hg° or HgCl
2
standards for this test.
8.3.2 The purpose of the CD measurement is to verify the ability of the CEMS to conform to the established CEMS response used for determining emission concentrations or emission rates. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and upscale response settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined.
8.3.3 Conduct the CD test using the zero gas specified and either the mid-level or high-level gas as specified in section 7.1. Sequentially introduce the reference gases to the CEMS at the sampling system of the CEMS immediately preceding the sample extraction filtration system. Record the CEMS response (A) for each reference gas and, using Equation 12A-2, subtract the corresponding reference value (R) from the CEMS value, and express the absolute value of the difference as a percentage of the span value (
see also
example data sheet in Figure 12A-2). For each reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value must not exceed 5 percent of the span value. If these specifications are not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding.

8.4.1 RA Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure given in sections 8.4.2 through 8.4.6 while the affected facility is operating normally, or as specified in an applicable subpart. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.
8.4.2 Reference Methods (RM). Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of this part, use method 29, method 30A, or method 30B in appendix A-8 to this part or ASTM Method D6784-16 (IBR, see § 60.17) as the RM for Hg concentration. For method 29 and ASTM Method D6784-16 only, the filterable portion of the sample need not be included when making comparisons to the CEMS results. When method 29, method 30B, or ASTM D6784-16 is used, conduct the RM test runs with paired or duplicate sampling systems and use the average of the vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by the two trains. When method 30A is used, paired sampling systems are not required. If the RM and CEMS measure on a different moisture basis, data derived with method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part must also be obtained during the RA test.
8.4.3 Sampling Strategy for RM Tests. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be compared to the CEMS data. The RM and CEMS locations need not be immediately adjacent. Locate the RM measurement points in accordance with section 8.1.3 of Performance Specification 2 (PS 2) in this appendix. It is preferable to conduct moisture measurements (if needed) and Hg measurements simultaneously, although moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the Hg measurements may be used to adjust the Hg concentrations to a consistent moisture basis. In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, note the beginning and end of each RM test period for each paired RM run (including the exact time of day) on the CEMS chart recordings or other permanent record of output.
8.4.4 Number and Length of RM Test Runs. Conduct a minimum of nine RM test runs. When method 29, method 30B, or ASTM D6784-16 is used, only test runs for which the paired RM trains meet the relative deviation criteria (RD) of this PS must be used in the RA calculations. In addition, for method 29 and ASTM D6784-16, use a minimum sample time of 2 hours and for methods 30A and 30B use a minimum sample time of 30 minutes.

# Note:
More than nine sets of RM test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, RM test run results may be excluded so long as the total number of RM test run results used to determine the CEMS RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported including the excluded test run data.
8.4.5 Correlation of RM and CEMS Data. Correlate the CEMS and the RM test data as to the time and duration by first determining from the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) the integrated average pollutant concentration for each RM test period. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the results are on a consistent moisture basis with the RM test. Then, compare each integrated CEMS
value against the corresponding RM value. When method 29, method 30B, or ASTM D6784-16 is used, compare each CEMS value against the corresponding average of the paired RM values.
8.4.6 Paired RM Outliers.
8.4.6.1 When method 29, method 30B, or ASTM D6784-16 is used, outliers are identified through the determination of relative deviation (RD) of the paired RM tests. Data that do not meet the RD criteria must be flagged as a data quality problem and may not be used in the calculation of RA. The primary reason for performing paired RM sampling is to ensure the quality of the RM data. The percent RD of paired data is the parameter used to quantify data quality. Determine RD for paired data points as follows:
ER29MR23.010
Where C
a
and C
b
are the Hg concentration values determined from the paired samples.
8.4.6.2 The minimum performance criteria for RM Hg data is that RD for any data pair must be ≤10 percent as long as the mean Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 µg/m
3
. If the mean Hg concentration is less than or equal to 1.0 µg/m
3
, the RD must be ≤20 percent or ≤0.2 µg/m
3
absolute difference. Pairs of RM data exceeding these RD criteria should be eliminated from the data set used to develop a Hg CEMS correlation or to assess CEMS RA.
8.4.7 Calculate the mean difference between the RM and CEMS values in the units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m
3
), the standard deviation, the confidence coefficient, and the RA according to the procedures in section 12.0.
8.5 Reporting. At a minimum (check with the appropriate EPA Regional Office, State or local Agency for additional requirements, if any), summarize in tabular form the results of the CD tests, the linearity tests, and the RA test or alternative RA procedure, as appropriate. Include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of CEMS responses), reference gas concentration certifications, and any other information necessary to confirm that the CEMS meets the performance criteria.

12.1 Consistent Basis. All data from the RM and CEMS must be compared in units of micrograms per standard cubic meter (µg/scm), on a consistent and identified moisture basis. The values must be standardized to 20 °C, 760 mm Hg.
12.1.1 Moisture Correction (as applicable). If the RM and CEMS measure Hg on a different moisture basis, they will need to be corrected to a consistent basis. Use Equation 12A-4a to correct data from a wet basis to a dry basis.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Measurement Error (ME). For Hg
0
, the ME must not exceed 5 percent of the span value at the zero-, mid-, and high-level reference gas concentrations. For HgCl
2
, the ME must not exceed 10 percent of the span value at the zero-, mid-, and high-level reference gas concentrations.
13.2 Calibration Drift (CD). The CD must not exceed 5 percent of the span value on any of the 7 days of the CD test.
13.3 Relative Accuracy (RA). The RA of the CEMS must be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the RM test data in terms of units of µg/scm. Alternatively, if the mean RM is less than 2.5 µg/scm, the results are acceptable if the absolute value of the difference between the mean RM and CEMS values added to the absolute value of the confidence coefficient from equation 12A-7 of this method does not exceed 0.5 µg/scm.

# Performance Specification 12B—Specifications and Test Procedures for Monitoring Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions From Stationary Sources Using a Sorbent Trap Monitoring System

# 1.0 Scope and Application
The purpose of Performance Specification 12B (PS 12B) is to establish performance benchmarks for, and to evaluate the acceptability of, sorbent trap monitoring systems used to monitor total vapor-phase mercury (Hg) emissions in stationary source flue gas streams. These monitoring systems involve continuous repetitive in-stack sampling using paired sorbent media traps with periodic analysis of the time-integrated samples. Persons using PS 12B should have a thorough working knowledge of Methods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 30B in appendices A-1 through A-3 and A-8 to this part.
1.1 Analyte. The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor phase Hg in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg
0
, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and gaseous forms of oxidized Hg (
i.e.,
Hg
+2
) in mass concentration units of micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm).

# 1.2 Applicability
1.2.1 These procedures are only intended for use under relatively low particulate conditions (e.g., monitoring after all pollution control devices). This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of total vapor phase Hg sorbent trap monitoring systems installed at stationary sources at the time of, or soon after, installation and whenever specified in the regulations. The Hg monitoring system must be capable of measuring the total concentration of vapor phase Hg (regardless of speciation), in units of µg/dscm.
1.2.2 This specification contains routine procedures and specifications designed to evaluate an installed sorbent trap monitoring system's performance over time; Procedure 5 of appendix F to this part contains additional procedures and specifications which may be required for long term operation. In addition, the source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the monitoring system properly. The Administrator may require the owner or operator, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, to conduct performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance.
See
§ 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).

# 2.0 Principle
Known volumes of flue gas are continuously extracted from a stack or duct through paired, in-stack, pre-spiked sorbent media traps at appropriate nominal flow rates. The sorbent traps in the sampling system are periodically exchanged with new ones, prepared for analysis as needed, and analyzed by any technique that can meet the performance criteria. For quality-assurance purposes, a section of each sorbent trap is spiked with Hg
0
prior to sampling. Following sampling, this section is analyzed separately and a specified minimum percentage of the spike must be recovered. Paired train sampling is required to determine method precision.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Sorbent Trap Monitoring System
means the total equipment required for the collection of gaseous Hg samples using paired three-partition sorbent traps.
3.2
Relative Accuracy Test Procedure
means a test procedure consisting of at least nine runs, in which the accuracy of the total vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by the sorbent trap monitoring system is evaluated by comparison against concurrent measurements made with a reference method (RM). Relative accuracy tests repeated on a regular, on-going basis are referred to as relative accuracy test audits or RATAs.
3.3
Relative Accuracy (RA)
means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant (Hg) concentrations determined by the sorbent trap monitoring system and the values determined by the reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for low concentration sources, the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean sorbent trap monitoring system and RM values.
3.4
Relative Deviation (RD)
means the absolute difference of the Hg concentration values obtained with a pair of sorbent traps divided by the sum of those concentrations, expressed as a percentage. RD is used to assess the precision of the sorbent trap monitoring system.
3.5
Spike Recovery
means the mass of Hg recovered from the spiked trap section, expressed as a percentage of the amount spiked. Spike recovery is used to assess sample matrix interference.

# 4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Equipment Specifications.
6.1.1 Monitoring System. The equipment described in Method 30B in appendix A-8 to this part must be used to continuously sample for Hg emissions, with the substitution of three-section traps in place of two-section traps, as described below. A typical sorbent trap monitoring system is shown in Figure 12B-1.
6.1.2 Three-Section Sorbent Traps. The sorbent media used to collect Hg must be configured in traps with three distinct and identical segments or sections, connected in series, to be separately analyzed. section 1 is designated for primary capture of gaseous Hg. section 2 is designated as a backup section for determination of vapor-phase Hg breakthrough. section 3 is designated for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) purposes. section 3 must be spiked with a known amount of gaseous Hg
0
prior to sampling and later analyzed to determine the spike (and hence sample) recovery efficiency.
ER09SE10.005
6.1.3 Gaseous Hg
0
Sorbent Trap Spiking System. A known mass of gaseous Hg
0
must be spiked onto section 3 of each sorbent trap prior to sampling. Any approach capable of quantitatively delivering known masses of Hg
0
onto sorbent traps is acceptable. Several technologies or devices are available to meet this objective. Their practicality is a function of Hg mass spike levels. For low levels, NIST-certified or NIST-traceable gas generators or tanks may be suitable, but will likely require long preparation times. A more practical, alternative system, capable of delivering almost any mass required, employs NIST-certified or NIST-traceable Hg salt solutions (e.g., Hg(NO
3
)
2
). With this system, an aliquot of known volume and concentration is added to a reaction vessel containing a reducing agent (e.g., stannous chloride); the Hg salt solution is reduced to Hg
0
and purged onto section 3 of the sorbent trap by using an impinger sparging system.
6.1.4 Sample Analysis Equipment. Any analytical system capable of quantitatively recovering and quantifying total gaseous Hg from sorbent media is acceptable provided that the analysis can meet the performance criteria in Table 12B-1 in section 9 of this performance specification. Candidate recovery techniques include leaching, digestion, and thermal desorption. Candidate analytical techniques include ultraviolet atomic fluorescence (UV AF); ultraviolet atomic absorption (UV AA), with and without gold trapping; and in-situ X-ray fluorescence (XRF).

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable calibration gas standards and reagents must be used for the tests and procedures required under this performance specification. The sorbent media may be any collection material (e.g., carbon, chemically treated filter,
etc.
) capable of quantitatively capturing and recovering for subsequent analysis, all gaseous forms of Hg in the emissions from the intended application. Selection of the sorbent media must be based on the material's ability to achieve the performance criteria contained in this method as well as the sorbent's vapor phase Hg capture efficiency for the emissions matrix and the expected sampling duration at the test site.

# 8.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure
8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.
8.1.1 Selection of Monitoring Site. Sampling site information should be obtained in accordance with Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Place the probe inlet at a point or location in the stack (or vent) downstream of all pollution control equipment and representative of the stack gas concentration of Hg. A location that has been shown to be free of stratification for Hg or, alternatively, SO
2
is recommended. An estimation of the expected stack Hg concentration is required to establish a target sample flow rate, total gas sample volume, and the mass of Hg
0
to be spiked onto section 3 of each sorbent trap.
8.1.2 Pre-sampling Spiking of Sorbent Traps. Based on the estimated Hg concentration in the stack, the target sample rate and the target sampling duration, calculate the expected mass loading for section 1 of each sorbent trap (
see
section 12.1 of this performance specification). The pre-sampling spike to be added to section 3 of each sorbent trap must be within ±50 percent of the expected section 1 mass loading. Spike section 3 of each sorbent trap at this level, as described in section 6.1.3 of this performance specification. For each sorbent trap, keep a record of the mass of Hg
0
added to section 3. This record must include, at a minimum, the identification number of the trap, the date and time of the spike, the name of the analyst performing the procedure, the method of spiking, the mass of Hg
0
added to section 3 of the trap (µg), and the supporting calculations.
8.1.3 Pre-monitoring Leak Check. Perform a leak check with the sorbent traps in place in the sampling system. Draw a vacuum in each sample train. Adjust the vacuum in each sample train to ~15″ Hg. Use the gas flow meter to determine leak rate. The leakage rate must not exceed 4 percent of the target sampling rate. Once the leak check passes this criterion, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train, then seal the sorbent trap inlet until the probe is ready for insertion into the stack or duct.
8.1.4 Determination of Flue Gas Characteristics. Determine or measure the flue gas measurement environment characteristics (gas temperature, static pressure, gas velocity, stack moisture,
etc.
) in order to determine ancillary requirements such as probe heating requirements (if any), sampling rate, proportional sampling conditions, moisture management,
etc.
8.2 Monitoring.
8.2.1 System Preparation and Initial Data Recording. Remove the plug from the end of each sorbent trap and store each plug in a clean sorbent trap storage container. Remove the stack or duct port cap and insert the probe(s) with the inlet(s) aligned perpendicular to the stack gas flow. Secure the probe(s) and ensure that no leakage occurs between the duct and environment. Record initial data including the sorbent trap ID, start time, starting gas flow meter readings, initial temperatures, set points, and any other appropriate information.
8.2.2 Flow Rate Control. Set the initial sample flow rate at the target value from section 8.1.1 of this performance specification. Then, for every operating hour during the sampling period, record the date and time, the sample flow rate, the gas flow meter reading, the stack temperature (if needed), the flow meter temperatures (if needed), temperatures of heated equipment such as the vacuum lines and the probes (if heated), and the sampling system vacuum readings. Also, record the stack gas flow rate and the ratio of the stack gas flow rate to the sample flow rate. Adjust the sampling flow rate to maintain proportional sampling,
i.e.,
keep the ratio of the stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate within ±25 percent of the reference ratio from the first hour of the data collection period (
see
section 12.2 of this performance specification). The sample flow rate through a sorbent trap monitoring system during any hour (or portion of an hour) that the unit is not operating must be zero.
8.2.3 Stack Gas Moisture Determination. If data from the sorbent trap monitoring system will be used to calculate Hg mass emissions, determine the stack gas moisture content using a continuous moisture monitoring system or other means acceptable to the Administrator, such as the ones described in § 75.11(b) of this chapter. Alternatively, for combustion of coal, wood, or natural gas in boilers only, a default moisture percentage from § 75.11(b) of this chapter may be used.
8.2.4 Essential Operating Data. Obtain and record any essential operating data for the facility during the test period, e.g., the barometric pressure for correcting the sample volume measured by a dry gas meter to standard conditions. At the end of the data collection period, record the final gas flow meter reading and the final values of all other essential parameters.
8.2.5 Post-monitoring Leak Check. When the monitoring period is completed, turn off the sample pump, remove the probe/sorbent trap from the port and carefully re-plug the end of each sorbent trap. Perform a leak check with the sorbent traps in place, at the maximum vacuum reached during the monitoring period. Use the same general approach described in section 8.1.3 of this performance specification. Record the leakage rate and vacuum. The leakage rate must not exceed 4 percent of the average sampling rate for the monitoring period. Following the leak check, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train.
8.2.6 Sample Recovery. Recover each sampled sorbent trap by removing it from the probe and seal both ends. Wipe any deposited material from the outside of the sorbent trap. Place the sorbent trap into an appropriate sample storage container and store/preserve it in an appropriate manner.
8.2.7 Sample Preservation, Storage, and Transport. While the performance criteria of this approach provide for verification of appropriate sample handling, it is still important that the user consider, determine, and plan for suitable sample preservation, storage, transport, and holding times for these measurements. Therefore, procedures in recognized voluntary consensus standards such as those in ASTM D6911-03 “Standard Guide for Packaging and Shipping Environmental Samples for Laboratory Analysis” should be followed for all samples.
8.2.8 Sample Custody. Proper procedures and documentation for sample chain of custody are critical to ensuring data integrity. Chain of custody procedures in recognized voluntary consensus standards such as those in ASTM D4840-99 “Standard Guide for Sample Chain-of-Custody Procedures” should be followed for all samples (including field samples and blanks).
8.3 Relative Accuracy (RA) Test Procedure
8.3.1 For the initial certification of a sorbent trap monitoring system, a RA Test is required. Follow the basic RA test procedures and calculation methodology described in sections 8.4.1 through 8.4.7 and 12.4 of PS 12A in this appendix, replacing the term “CEMS” with “sorbent trap monitoring system”.
8.3.2 Special Considerations. The type of sorbent material used in the traps must be the same as that used for daily operation of the monitoring system; however, the size of the traps used for the RA test may be smaller than the traps used for daily operation of the system. Spike the third section of each sorbent trap with elemental Hg, as described in section 8.1.2 of this performance specification. Install a new pair of sorbent traps prior to each test run. For each run, the sorbent trap data must be validated according to the quality assurance criteria in Table 12B-1 in section 9.0, below.
8.3.3 Acceptance Criteria. The RA of the sorbent trap monitoring system must be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the RM test data in terms of units of µg/scm. Alternatively, if the RM concentration is less than or equal to 5.0 µg/scm, then the RA results are acceptable if the absolute difference between the means of the RM and sorbent trap monitoring system values does not exceed 1.0 µg/scm.

# 9.0 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)
Table 12B-1 summarizes the QA/QC performance criteria that are used to validate the Hg emissions data from a sorbent trap monitoring system. Failure to achieve these performance criteria will result in invalidation of Hg emissions data, except where otherwise noted.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Gaseous and Liquid Standards. Only NIST certified or NIST-traceable calibration standards (
i.e.,
calibration gases, solutions,
etc.
) must be used for the spiking and analytical procedures in this performance specification.
10.2 Gas Flow Meter Calibration. The manufacturer or supplier of the gas flow meter should perform all necessary set-up, testing, programming,
etc.,
and should provide the end user with any necessary instructions, to ensure that the meter will give an accurate readout of dry gas volume in standard cubic meters for the particular field application.
10.2.1 Initial Calibration. Prior to its initial use, a calibration of the flow meter must be performed. The initial calibration may be done by the manufacturer, by the equipment supplier, or by the end user. If the flow meter is volumetric in nature (e.g., a dry gas meter), the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may perform a direct volumetric calibration using any gas. For a mass flow meter, the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may calibrate the meter using a bottled gas mixture containing 12 ±0.5% CO
2
, 7 ±0.5% O
2
, and balance N
2
, or these same gases in proportions more representative of the expected stack gas composition. Mass flow meters may also be initially calibrated on-site, using actual stack gas.
10.2.1.1 Initial Calibration Procedures. Determine an average calibration factor (Y) for the gas flow meter, by calibrating it at three sample flow rate settings covering the range of sample flow rates at which the sorbent trap monitoring system typically operates. Either the procedures in section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part or the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part may be followed. If a dry gas meter is being calibrated, use at least five revolutions of the meter at each flow rate.
10.2.1.2 Alternative Initial Calibration Procedures. Alternatively, the initial calibration of the gas flow meter may be performed using a reference gas flow meter (RGFM). The RGFM may be either: (1) A wet test meter calibrated according to section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; (2) A gas flow metering device calibrated at multiple flow rates using the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; or (3) A NIST-traceable calibration device capable of measuring volumetric flow to an accuracy of 1 percent. To calibrate the gas flow meter using the RGFM, proceed as follows: While the sorbent trap monitoring system is sampling the actual stack gas or a compressed gas mixture that simulates the stack gas composition (as applicable), connect the RGFM to the discharge of the system. Care should be taken to minimize the dead volume between the sample flow meter being tested and the RGFM. Concurrently measure dry gas volume with the RGFM and the flow meter being calibrated for a minimum of 10 minutes at each of three flow rates covering the typical range of operation of the sorbent trap monitoring system. For each 10-minute (or longer) data collection period, record the total sample volume, in units of dry standard cubic meters (dscm), measured by the RGFM and the gas flow meter being tested.
10.2.1.3 Initial Calibration Factor. Calculate an individual calibration factor Yi at each tested flow rate from section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification (as applicable), by taking the ratio of the reference sample volume to the sample volume recorded by the gas flow meter. Average the three Yi values, to determine Y, the calibration factor for the flow meter. Each of the three individual values of Yi must be within ±0.02 of Y. Except as otherwise provided in sections 10.2.1.4 and 10.2.1.5 of this performance specification, use the average Y value from the three level calibration to adjust all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.
10.2.2 Initial On-Site Calibration Check. For a mass flow meter that was initially calibrated using a compressed gas mixture, an on-site calibration check must be performed before using the flow meter to provide data. While sampling stack gas, check the calibration of the flow meter at one intermediate flow rate typical of normal operation of the monitoring system. Follow the basic procedures in section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification. If the onsite calibration check shows that the value of Yi, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs by more than 5 percent from the value of Y obtained in the initial calibration of the meter, repeat the full 3-level calibration of the meter using stack gas to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.
10.2.3 Ongoing Quality Control. Recalibrate the gas flow meter quarterly at one intermediate flow rate setting representative of normal operation of the monitoring system. Follow the basic procedures in section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification. If a quarterly recalibration shows that the value of Yi, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs from the current value of Y by more than 5 percent, repeat the full 3-level calibration of the meter to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.
10.3 Calibration of Thermocouples and Other Temperature Sensors. Use the procedures and criteria in section 10.3 of Method 2 in appendix A-1 to this part to calibrate in-
stack temperature sensors and thermocouples. Calibrations must be performed prior to initial use and at least quarterly thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute temperature measured by the temperature sensor must agree to within ±1.5 percent of the temperature measured with the reference sensor, otherwise the sensor may not continue to be used.
10.4 Barometer Calibration. Calibrate the barometer against another barometer that has a NIST-traceable calibration. This calibration must be performed prior to initial use and at least quarterly thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute pressure measured by the barometer must agree to within ±10 mm Hg of the pressure measured by the NIST-traceable barometer, otherwise the barometer may not continue to be used.
10.5 Calibration of Other Sensors and Gauges. Calibrate all other sensors and gauges according to the procedures specified by the instrument manufacturer(s).
10.6 Analytical System Calibration.
See
section 11.1 of this performance specification.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
The analysis of the Hg samples may be conducted using any instrument or technology capable of quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media and meeting the performance criteria in section 9 of this performance specification.
11.1 Analyzer System Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration of the analyzer at three or more upscale points over the desired quantitative range (multiple calibration ranges must be calibrated, if necessary). The field samples analyzed must fall within a calibrated, quantitative range and meet the necessary performance criteria. For samples that are suitable for aliquotting, a series of dilutions may be needed to ensure that the samples fall within a calibrated range. However, for sorbent media samples that are consumed during analysis (e.g., thermal desorption techniques), extra care must be taken to ensure that the analytical system is appropriately calibrated prior to sample analysis. The calibration curve range(s) should be determined based on the anticipated level of Hg mass on the sorbent media. Knowledge of estimated stack Hg concentrations and total sample volume may be required prior to analysis. The calibration curve for use with the various analytical techniques (e.g., UV AA, UV AF, and XRF) can be generated by directly introducing standard solutions into the analyzer or by spiking the standards onto the sorbent media and then introducing into the analyzer after preparing the sorbent/standard according to the particular analytical technique. For each calibration curve, the value of the square of the linear correlation coefficient,
i.e.,
r
2
, must be ≥0.99, and the analyzer response must be within ±10 percent of reference value at each upscale calibration point. Calibrations must be performed on the day of the analysis, before analyzing any of the samples. Following calibration, an independently prepared standard (not from same calibration stock solution) must be analyzed. The measured value of the independently prepared standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.
11.2 Sample Preparation. Carefully separate the three sections of each sorbent trap. Combine for analysis all materials associated with each section,
i.e.,
any supporting substrate that the sample gas passes through prior to entering a media section (e.g., glass wool, polyurethane foam,
etc.
) must be analyzed with that segment.
11.3 Spike Recovery Study. Before analyzing any field samples, the laboratory must demonstrate the ability to recover and quantify Hg from the sorbent media by performing the following spike recovery study for sorbent media traps spiked with elemental mercury. Using the procedures described in sections 6.2 and 12.1 of this performance specification, spike the third section of nine sorbent traps with gaseous Hg
0
,
i.e.,
three traps at each of three different mass loadings, representing the range of masses anticipated in the field samples. This will yield a 3 × 3 sample matrix. Prepare and analyze the third section of each spiked trap, using the techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for each spike concentration must be between 85 and 115 percent. If multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate spike recovery study is required for each sorbent material. If multiple ranges are calibrated, a separate spike recovery study is required for each range.
11.4 Field Sample Analyses. Analyze the sorbent trap samples following the same procedures that were used for conducting the spike recovery study. The three sections of each sorbent trap must be analyzed separately (
i.e.,
section 1, then section 2, then section 3). Quantify the total mass of Hg for each section based on analytical system response and the calibration curve from section 11.1 of this performance specification. Determine the spike recovery from sorbent trap section 3. The spike recovery must be no less than 75 percent and no greater than 125 percent. To report the final Hg mass for each trap, add together the Hg masses collected in trap sections 1 and 2.

# 12.0 Calculations, Data Reduction, and Data Analysis
12.1 Calculation of Pre-Sampling Spiking Level. Determine sorbent trap section 3 spiking level using estimates of the stack Hg concentration, the target sample flow rate, and the expected monitoring period. Calculate M
exp
, the expected Hg mass that will
be collected in section 1 of the trap, using Equation 12B-1. The pre-sampling spike must be within ±50 percent of this mass.
ER09SE10.018

# Example calculation:
For an estimated stack Hg concentration of 5 µg/m

= (0.30 L/min)(1440 min/day)(5 days)(10

/L)(5 µg/m

) = 10.8 µg
A pre-sampling spike of 10.8 µg ±50 percent is, therefore, appropriate.
12.2 Calculations for Flow-Proportional Sampling. For the first hour of the data collection period, determine the reference ratio of the stack gas volumetric flow rate to the sample flow rate, as follows:
ER09SE10.019
Where:
R
ref
= Reference ratio of hourly stack gas flow rate to hourly sample flow rate
Q
ref
= Average stack gas volumetric flow rate for first hour of collection period (scfh)
F
ref
= Average sample flow rate for first hour of the collection period, in appropriate units (e.g., liters/min, cc/min, dscm/min)
K = Power of ten multiplier, to keep the value of R
ref
between 1 and 100. The appropriate K value will depend on the selected units of measure for the sample flow rate.
Then, for each subsequent hour of the data collection period, calculate ratio of the stack gas flow rate to the sample flow rate using Equation 12B-3:
ER09SE10.020
Where:
R
h
= Ratio of hourly stack gas flow rate to hourly sample flow rate
Q
h
= Average stack gas volumetric flow rate for the hour (scfh)
F
h
= Average sample flow rate for the hour, in appropriate units (e.g., liters/min, cc/min, dscm/min)
K = Power of ten multiplier, to keep the value of R
h
between 1 and 100. The appropriate K value will depend on the selected units of measure for the sample flow rate and the range of expected stack gas flow rates.
Maintain the value of R
h
within ±25 percent of R
ref
throughout the data collection period.
12.3 Calculation of Spike Recovery. Calculate the percent recovery of each section 3 spike, as follows:
ER09SE10.021
Where:
%R = Percentage recovery of the pre-sampling spike
M
3
= Mass of Hg recovered from section 3 of the sorbent trap, (µg)
M
s
= Calculated Hg mass of the pre-sampling spike, from section 8.1.2 of this performance specification, (µg)
12.4 Calculation of Breakthrough. Calculate the percent breakthrough to the second section of the sorbent trap, as follows:
ER09SE10.022
Where:
%B = Percent breakthrough
M
2
= Mass of Hg recovered from section 2 of the sorbent trap, (µg)
M
1
= Mass of Hg recovered from section 1 of the sorbent trap, (µg)
12.5 Calculation of Hg Concentration. Calculate the Hg concentration for each sorbent trap, using the following equation:
ER09SE10.023
Where:
C = Concentration of Hg for the collection period, (µg/dscm)
M* = Total mass of Hg recovered from sections 1 and 2 of the sorbent trap, (µg)
V
t
= Total volume of dry gas metered during the collection period, (dscm). For the purposes of this performance specification, standard temperature and pressure are defined as 20 °C and 760 mm Hg, respectively.
12.6 Calculation of Paired Trap Agreement. Calculate the relative deviation (RD) between the Hg concentrations measured with the paired sorbent traps:
ER09SE10.024
Where:
RD = Relative deviation between the Hg concentrations from traps “a” and “b” (percent)
C
a
= Concentration of Hg for the collection period, for sorbent trap “a” (µg/dscm)
C
b
= Concentration of Hg for the collection period, for sorbent trap “b” (µg/dscm)
12.7 Calculation of Relative Accuracy. Calculate the relative accuracy as described in section 12.4 of PS 12A in this appendix.
12.8 Data Reduction. Typical monitoring periods for normal, day-to-day operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system range from about 24 hours to 168 hours. For the required RA tests of the system, smaller sorbent traps are often used, and the “monitoring period” or time per run is considerably shorter (e.g., 1 hour or less). Generally speaking, to validate sorbent trap monitoring system data, the acceptance criteria for the following five QC specifications in Table 12B-1 above must be met for both traps: (a) the post-monitoring leak check; (b) the ratio of stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate; (c) section 2 breakthrough; (d) paired trap agreement; and (e) section 3 spike recovery.
12.8.1 For routine day-to-day operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system, when both traps meet the acceptance criteria for all five QC specifications, the two measured Hg concentrations must be averaged arithmetically and the average value must be applied to each hour of the data collection period.
12.8.2 To validate a RA test run, both traps must meet the acceptance criteria for all five QC specifications. However, as specified
in section 12.8.3 below, for routine day-to-day operation of the monitoring system, a monitoring period may, in certain instances, be validated based on the results from one trap.
12.8.3 For the routine, day-to-day operation of the monitoring system, when one of the two sorbent trap samples or sampling systems either: (a) Fails the post-monitoring leak check; or (b) has excessive section 2 breakthrough; or (c) fails to maintain the proper stack flow-to-sample flow ratio; or (d) fails to achieve the required section 3 spike recovery; or (e) is lost, broken, or damaged, provided that the other trap meets the acceptance criteria for all four of these QC specifications, the Hg concentration measured by the valid trap may be multiplied by a factor of 1.111 and then used for reporting purposes. Further, if both traps meet the acceptance criteria for all four of these QC specifications, but the acceptance criterion for paired trap agreement is not met, the owner or operator may report the higher of the two Hg concentrations measured by the traps, in lieu of invalidating the data from the paired traps.
12.8.4 Whenever the data from a pair of sorbent traps must be invalidated and no quality-assured data from a certified backup Hg monitoring system or Hg reference method are available to cover the hours in the data collection period, treat those hours in the manner specified in the applicable regulation (
i.e.,
use missing data substitution procedures or count the hours as monitoring system down time, as appropriate).

# 13.0 Monitoring System Performance
These monitoring criteria and procedures have been successfully applied to coal-fired utility boilers (including units with post-combustion emission controls), having vapor-phase Hg concentrations ranging from 0.03 µg/dscm to approximately 100 µg/dscm.

# Performance Specification 15—Performance Specification for Extractive FTIR Continuous Emissions Monitor Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes. This performance specification is applicable for measuring all hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which absorb in the infrared region and can be quantified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), as long as the performance criteria of this performance specification are met. This specification is to be used for evaluating FTIR continuous emission monitoring systems for measuring HAPs regulated under Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. This specification also applies to the use of FTIR CEMs for measuring other volatile organic or inorganic species.
1.2 Applicability. A source which can demonstrate that the extractive FTIR system meets the criteria of this performance specification for each regulated pollutant may use the FTIR system to continuously monitor for the regulated pollutants.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
For compound-specific sampling requirements refer to FTIR sampling methods (
e.g.,
reference 1). For data reduction procedures and requirements refer to the EPA FTIR Protocol (reference 2), hereafter referred to as the “FTIR Protocol.” This specification describes sampling and analytical procedures for quality assurance. The infrared spectrum of any absorbing compound provides a distinct signature. The infrared spectrum of a mixture contains the superimposed spectra of each mixture component. Thus, an FTIR CEM provides the capability to continuously measure multiple components in a sample using a single analyzer. The number of compounds that can be speciated in a single spectrum depends, in practice, on the specific compounds present and the test conditions.

# 3.0 Definitions
For a list of definitions related to FTIR spectroscopy refer to Appendix A of the FTIR Protocol. Unless otherwise specified, spectroscopic terms, symbols and equations in this performance specification are taken from the FTIR Protocol or from documents cited in the Protocol. Additional definitions are given below.
3.1 FTIR Continuous Emission Monitoring System (FTIR CEM).
3.1.1
FTIR System.
Instrument to measure spectra in the mid-infrared spectral region (500 to 4000 cm
−1
). It contains an infrared source, interferometer, sample gas containment cell, infrared detector, and computer. The interferometer consists of a beam splitter that divides the beam into two paths, one
path a fixed distance and the other a variable distance. The computer is equipped with software to run the interferometer and store the raw digitized signal from the detector (interferogram). The software performs the mathematical conversion (the Fourier transform) of the interferogram into a spectrum showing the frequency dependent sample absorbance. All spectral data can be stored on computer media.
3.1.2
Gas Cell.
A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It contains the sample as the infrared beam passes from the interferometer, through the sample, and to the detector. The gas cell may have multi-pass mirrors depending on the required detection limit(s) for the application.
3.1.3
Sampling System.
Equipment used to extract sample from the test location and transport the gas to the FTIR analyzer. Sampling system components include probe, heated line, heated non-reactive pump, gas distribution manifold and valves, flow measurement devices and any sample conditioning systems.
3.2
Reference CEM.
An FTIR CEM, with sampling system, that can be used for comparison measurements.
3.3
Infrared Band (also Absorbance Band or Band).
Collection of lines arising from rotational transitions superimposed on a vibrational transition. An infrared absorbance band is analyzed to determine the analyte concentration.
3.4
Sample Analysis.
Interpreting infrared band shapes, frequencies, and intensities to obtain sample component concentrations. This is usually performed by a software routine using a classical least squares (cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P- matrix method.
3.5
(Target) Analyte.
A compound whose measurement is required, usually to some established limit of detection and analytical uncertainty.
3.6
Interferant.
A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared spectrum overlaps at least part of an analyte spectrum complicating the analyte measurement. The interferant may not prevent the analyte measurement, but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured concentration. Reference spectra of interferants are used to distinguish the interferant bands from the analyte bands. An interferant for one analyte may not be an interferant for other analytes.
3.7
Reference Spectrum.
Infrared spectra of an analyte, or interferant, prepared under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions (see section 4.6 of the FTIR Protocol). A suitable library of reference spectra can be used to measure target analytes in gas samples.
3.8
Calibration Spectrum.
Infrared spectrum of a compound suitable for characterizing the FTIR instrument configuration (Section 4.5 in the FTIR Protocol).
3.9
One hundred percent line.
A double beam transmittance spectrum obtained by combining two successive background single beam spectra. Ideally, this line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every point in the spectrum. The zero absorbance line is used to measure the RMS noise of the system.
3.10
Background Deviation.
Any deviation (from 100 percent) in the one hundred percent line (or from zero absorbance). Deviations greater than ±5 percent in any analytical region are unacceptable. Such deviations indicate a change in the instrument throughput relative to the single-beam background.
3.11
Batch Sampling.
A gas cell is alternately filled and evacuated. A Spectrum of each filled cell (one discreet sample) is collected and saved.
3.12
Continuous Sampling.
Sample is continuously flowing through a gas cell. Spectra of the flowing sample are collected at regular intervals.
3.13
Continuous Operation.
In continuous operation an FTIR CEM system, without user intervention, samples flue gas, records spectra of samples, saves the spectra to a disk, analyzes the spectra for the target analytes, and prints concentrations of target analytes to a computer file. User intervention is permitted for initial set-up of sampling system, initial calibrations, and periodic maintenance.
3.14
Sampling Time.
In batch sampling—the time required to fill the cell with flue gas. In continuous sampling—the time required to collect the infrared spectrum of the sample gas.
3.15 PPM-Meters. Sample concentration expressed as the concentration-path length product, ppm (molar) concentration multiplied by the path length of the FTIR gas cell. Expressing concentration in these units provides a way to directly compare measurements made using systems with different optical configurations. Another useful expression is (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the absolute temperature of the sample in the gas cell.
3.16
CEM Measurement Time Constant.
The Time Constant (TC, minutes for one cell volume to flow through the cell) determines the minimum interval for complete removal of an analyte from the FTIR cell. It depends on the sampling rate (R
s
in Lpm), the FTIR cell volume (V
cell
in L) and the chemical and physical properties of an analyte.
ER17OC00.464
For example, if the sample flow rate (through the FTIR cell) is 5 Lpm and the cell volume is 7 liters, then TC is equal to 1.4
minutes (0.71 cell volumes per minute). This performance specification defines 5 * TC as the minimum interval between independent samples.
3.17
Independent Measurement.
Two independent measurements are spectra of two independent samples. Two independent samples are separated by, at least 5 cell volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell). There is no mixing of gas between two independent samples. Alternatively, estimate the analyte residence time empirically: (1) Fill cell to ambient pressure with a (known analyte concentration) gas standard, (2) measure the spectrum of the gas standard, (3) purge the cell with zero gas at the sampling rate and collect a spectrum every minute until the analyte standard is no longer detected spectroscopically. If the measured time corresponds to less than 5 cell volumes, use 5 * TC as the minimum interval between independent measurements. If the measured time is greater than 5 * TC, then use this time as the minimum interval between independent measurements.
3.18
Test Condition.
A period of sampling where all process, and sampling conditions, and emissions remain constant and during which a single sampling technique and a single analytical program are used. One Run may include results for more than one test condition. Constant emissions means that the composition of the emissions remains approximately stable so that a single analytical program is suitable for analyzing all of the sample spectra. A greater than two-fold change in analyte or interferant concentrations or the appearance of additional compounds in the emissions, may constitute a new test condition and may require modification of the analytical program.
3.19
Run.
A single Run consists of spectra (one spectrum each) of at least 10 independent samples over a minimum of one hour. The concentration results from the spectra can be averaged together to give a run average for each analyte measured in the test run.

# 4.0 Interferences
Several compounds, including water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, are known interferences in the infrared region in which the FTIR instrument operates. Follow the procedures in the FTIR protocol for subtracting or otherwise dealing with these and other interferences.

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS users manual and materials recommended by this performance specification should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Installation of sampling equipment should follow requirements of FTIR test Methods such as references 1 and 3 and the EPA FTIR Protocol (reference 2). Select test points where the gas stream composition is representative of the process emissions. If comparing to a reference method, the probe tips for the FTIR CEM and the RM should be positioned close together using the same sample port if possible.
6.2 FTIR Specifications. The FTIR CEM must be equipped with reference spectra bracketing the range of path length-concentrations (absorbance intensities) to be measured for each analyte. The effective concentration range of the analyzer can be adjusted by changing the path length of the gas cell or by diluting the sample. The optical configuration of the FTIR system must be such that maximum absorbance of any target analyte is no greater than 1.0 and the minimum absorbance of any target analyte is at least 10 times the RMSD noise in the analytical region. For example, if the measured RMSD in an analytical region is equal to 10
−3
, then the peak analyte absorbance is required to be at least 0.01. Adequate measurement of all of the target analytes may require changing path lengths during a run, conducting separate runs for different analytes, diluting the sample, or using more than one gas cell.
6.3 Data Storage Requirements. The system must have sufficient capacity to store all data collected in one week of routine sampling. Data must be stored to a write-protected medium, such as write-once-read-many (WORM) optical storage medium or to a password protected remote storage location. A back-up copy of all data can be temporarily saved to the computer hard drive. The following items must be stored during testing.
• At least one sample interferogram per sampling Run or one interferogram per hour, whichever is greater. This assumes that no sampling or analytical conditions have changed during the run.
• All sample absorbance spectra (about 12 per hr, 288 per day).
• All background spectra and interferograms (variable, but about 5 per day).
• All CTS spectra and interferograms (at least 2 each 24 hour period).
• Documentation showing a record of resolution, path length, apodization, sampling
time, sampling conditions, and test conditions for all sample, CTS, calibration, and background spectra.
Using a resolution of 0.5 cm
−1
, with analytical range of 3500 cm
−1
, assuming about 65 Kbytes per spectrum and 130 Kb per interferogram, the storage requirement is about 164 Mb for one week of continuous sampling. Lower spectral resolution requires less storage capacity. All of the above data must be stored for at least two weeks. After two weeks, storage requirements include: (1) all analytical results (calculated concentrations), (2) at least 1 sample spectrum with corresponding background and sample interferograms for each test condition, (3) CTS and calibration spectra with at least one interferogram for CTS and all interferograms for calibrations, (4) a record of analytical input used to produce results, and (5) all other documentation. These data must be stored according to the requirements of the applicable regulation.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
[Reserved]

# 9.0 Quality Control
These procedures shall be used for periodic quarterly or semiannual QA/QC checks on the operation of the FTIR CEM. Some procedures test only the analytical program and are not intended as a test of the sampling system.
9.1 Audit Sample. This can serve as a check on both the sampling system and the analytical program.
9.1.1 Sample Requirements. The audit sample can be a mixture or a single component. It must contain target analyte(s) at approximately the expected flue gas concentration(s). If possible, each mixture component concentration should be NIST traceable (±2 percent accuracy). If a cylinder mixture standard(s) cannot be obtained, then, alternatively, a gas phase standard can be generated from a condensed phase analyte sample. Audit sample contents and concentrations are not revealed to the FTIR CEM operator until after successful completion of procedures in 5.3.2.
9.1.2 Test Procedure. Spike the audit sample using the analyte spike procedure in section 11. The audit sample is measured directly by the FTIR system (undiluted) and then spiked into the effluent at a known dilution ratio. Measure a series of spiked and unspiked samples using the same procedures as those used to analyze the stack gas. Analyze the results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. The measured concentration of each analyte must be within ±5 percent of the expected concentration (plus the uncertainty),
i.e.,
the calculated correction factor must be within 0.93 and 1.07 for an audit with an analyte uncertainty of ±2 percent.
9.2 Audit Spectra. Audit spectra can be used to test the analytical program of the FTIR CEM, but provide no test of the sampling system.
9.2.1 Definition and Requirements. Audit spectra are absorbance spectra that; (1) have been well characterized, and (2) contain absorbance bands of target analyte(s) and potential interferants at intensities equivalent to what is expected in the source effluent. Audit spectra are provided by the administrator without identifying information. Methods of preparing Audit spectra include; (1) mathematically adding sample spectra or adding reference and interferant spectra, (2) obtaining sample spectra of mixtures prepared in the laboratory, or (3) they may be sample spectra collected previously at a similar source. In the last case it must be demonstrated that the analytical results are correct and reproducible. A record associated with each Audit spectrum documents its method of preparation. The documentation must be sufficient to enable an independent analyst to reproduce the Audit spectra.
9.2.2 Test Procedure. Audit spectra concentrations are measured using the FTIR CEM analytical program. Analytical results must be within ±5 percent of the certified audit concentration for each analyte (plus the uncertainty in the audit concentration). If the condition is not met, demonstrate how the audit spectra are unrepresentative of the sample spectra. If the audit spectra are representative, modify the FTIR CEM analytical program until the test requirement is met. Use the new analytical program in subsequent FTIR CEM analyses of effluent samples.
9.3 Submit Spectra For Independent Analysis. This procedure tests only the analytical program and not the FTIR CEM sampling system. The analyst can submit FTIR CEM spectra for independent analysis by EPA. Requirements for submission include; (1) three representative absorbance spectra (and stored interferograms) for each test period to be reviewed, (2) corresponding CTS spectra, (3) corresponding background spectra and interferograms, (4) spectra of associated spiked samples if applicable, and (5) analytical results for these sample spectra. The analyst will also submit documentation of process times and conditions, sampling conditions associated with each spectrum, file names and sampling times, method of analysis and reference spectra used, optical configuration of FTIR CEM including cell path length and temperature, spectral resolution and apodization used for every spectrum. Independent analysis can also be performed on site in conjunction with the FTIR CEM sampling and analysis. Sample spectra are stored on the independent analytical system
as they are collected by the FTIR CEM system. The FTIR CEM and the independent analyses are then performed separately. The two analyses will agree to within ±120 percent for each analyte using the procedure in section 12.3. This assumes both analytical routines have properly accounted for differences in optical path length, resolution, and temperature between the sample spectra and the reference spectra.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Calibration Transfer Standards. For CTS requirements see section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol. A well characterized absorbance band in the CTS gas is used to measure the path length and line resolution of the instrument. The CTS measurements made at the beginning of every 24 hour period must agree to within ±5 percent after correction for differences in pressure.
Verify that the frequency response of the instrument and CTS absorbance intensity are correct by comparing to other CTS spectra or by referring to the literature.
10.2 Analyte Calibration. If EPA library reference spectra are not available, use calibration standards to prepare reference spectra according to section 6 of the FTIR Protocol. A suitable set of analyte reference data includes spectra of at least 2 independent samples at each of at least 2 different concentrations. The concentrations bracket a range that includes the expected analyte absorbance intensities. The linear fit of the reference analyte band areas must have a fractional calibration uncertainty (FCU in Appendix F of the FTIR Protocol) of no greater than 10 percent. For requirements of analyte standards refer to section 4.6 of the FTIR Protocol.
10.3 System Calibration. The calibration standard is introduced at a point on the sampling probe. The sampling system is purged with the calibration standard to verify that the absorbance measured in this way is equal to the absorbance in the analyte calibration. Note that the system calibration gives no indication of the ability of the sampling system to transport the target analyte(s) under the test conditions.
10.4 Analyte Spike. The target analyte(s) is spiked at the outlet of the sampling probe, upstream of the particulate filter, and combined with effluent at a ratio of about 1 part spike to 9 parts effluent. The measured absorbance of the spike is compared to the expected absorbance of the spike plus the analyte concentration already in the effluent. This measures sampling system bias, if any, as distinguished from analyzer bias. It is important that spiked sample pass through all of the sampling system components before analysis.
10.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The measure of S/N in this performance specification is the root-mean-square (RMS) noise level as given in Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment of a spectrum is defined as the RMS difference (RMSD) between the n contiguous absorbance values (A
i
) which form the segment and the mean value (A
M
) of that segment.
ER17OC00.465
A decrease in the S/N may indicate a loss in optical throughput, or detector or interferometer malfunction.
10.6 Background Deviation. The 100 percent baseline must be between 95 and 105 percent transmittance (absorbance of 0.02 to −0.02) in every analytical region. When background deviation exceeds this range, a new background spectrum must be collected using nitrogen or other zero gas.
10.7 Detector Linearity. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument aperture settings; one at the aperture setting to be used in the testing, and one each at settings one half and twice the test aperture setting. Compare the three CTS spectra. CTS band areas should agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard. If test aperture is the maximum aperture, collect CTS spectrum at maximum aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the IR through-put by half. Collect a second background and CTS at the smaller aperture setting and compare the spectra as above. Instead of changing the aperture neutral density filters can be used to attenuate the infrared beam. Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the interferometer) to approximately
1/2
its original intensity. Collect a second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam to approximately
1/4
its original intensity. Collect a third background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra as above. Another check on linearity is to observe the single beam background in frequency regions where the optical configuration is known to have a zero response. Verify that the detector response is “flat” and equal to zero in these regions. If detector response is not linear, decrease aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. Repeat the linearity check until system passes the requirement.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Initial Certification. First, perform the evaluation procedures in section 6.0 of the FTIR Protocol. The performance of an FTIR CEM can be certified upon installation using EPA Method 301 type validation (40 CFR, Part 63, Appendix A), or by comparison to a
reference Method if one exists for the target analyte(s). Details of each procedure are given below. Validation testing is used for initial certification upon installation of a new system. Subsequent performance checks can be performed with more limited analyte spiking. Performance of the analytical program is checked initially, and periodically as required by EPA, by analyzing audit spectra or audit gases.
11.1.1 Validation. Use EPA Method 301 type sampling (reference 4, section 5.3 of Method 301) to validate the FTIR CEM for measuring the target analytes. The analyte spike procedure is as follows: (1) a known concentration of analyte is mixed with a known concentration of a non-reactive tracer gas, (2) the undiluted spike gas is sent directly to the FTIR cell and a spectrum of this sample is collected, (3) pre-heat the spiked gas to at least the sample line temperature, (4) introduce spike gas at the back of the sample probe upstream of the particulate filter, (5) spiked effluent is carried through all sampling components downstream of the probe, (6) spike at a ratio of roughly 1 part spike to 9 parts flue gas (or more dilute), (7) the spike-to-flue gas ratio is estimated by comparing the spike flow to the total sample flow, and (8) the spike ratio is verified by comparing the tracer concentration in spiked flue gas to the tracer concentration in undiluted spike gas. The analyte flue gas concentration is unimportant as long as the spiked component can be measured and the sample matrix (including interferences) is similar to its composition under test conditions. Validation can be performed using a single FTIR CEM analyzing sample spectra collected sequentially. Since flue gas analyte (unspiked) concentrations can vary, it is recommended that two separate sampling lines (and pumps) are used; one line to carry unspiked flue gas and the other line to carry spiked flue gas. Even with two sampling lines the variation in unspiked concentration may be fast compared to the interval between consecutive measurements. Alternatively, two FTIR CEMs can be operated side-by-side, one measuring spiked sample, the other unspiked sample. In this arrangement spiked and unspiked measurements can be synchronized to minimize the affect of temporal variation in the unspiked analyte concentration. In either sampling arrangement, the interval between measured concentrations used in the statistical analysis should be, at least, 5 cell volumes (5 * TC in equation 1). A validation run consists of, at least, 24 independent analytical results, 12 spiked and 12 unspiked samples. See section 3.17 for definition of an “independent” analytical result. The results are analyzed using sections 12.1 and 12.2 to determine if the measurements passed the validation requirements. Several analytes can be spiked and measured in the same sampling run, but a separate statistical analysis is performed for each analyte. In lieu of 24 independent measurements, averaged results can be used in the statistical analysis. In this procedure, a series of consecutive spiked measurements are combined over a sampling period to give a single average result. The related unspiked measurements are averaged in the same way. The minimum 12 spiked and 12 unspiked result averages are obtained by averaging measurements over subsequent sampling periods of equal duration. The averaged results are grouped together and statistically analyzed using section 12.2.
11.1.1.1 Validation with a Single Analyzer and Sampling Line. If one sampling line is used, connect the sampling system components and purge the entire sampling system and cell with at least 10 cell volumes of sample gas. Begin sampling by collecting spectra of 2 independent unspiked samples. Introduce the spike gas into the back of the probe, upstream of the particulate filter. Allow 10 cell volumes of spiked flue gas to purge the cell and sampling system. Collect spectra of 2 independent spiked samples. Turn off the spike flow and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked flue gas to purge the FTIR cell and sampling system. Repeat this procedure 6 times until the 24 samples are collected. Spiked and unspiked samples can also be measured in groups of 4 instead of in pairs. Analyze the results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. If the statistical analysis passes the validation criteria, then the validation is completed. If the results do not pass the validation, the cause may be that temporal variations in the analyte sample gas concentration are fast relative to the interval between measurements. The difficulty may be avoided by: (1) Averaging the measurements over long sampling periods and using the averaged results in the statistical analysis, (2) modifying the sampling system to reduce TC by, for example, using a smaller volume cell or increasing the sample flow rate, (3) using two sample lines (4) use two analyzers to perform synchronized measurements. This performance specification permits modifications in the sampling system to minimize TC if the other requirements of the validation sampling procedure are met.
11.1.1.2 Validation With a Single Analyzer and Two Sampling Lines. An alternative sampling procedure uses two separate sample lines, one carrying spiked flue gas, the other carrying unspiked gas. A valve in the gas distribution manifold allows the operator to choose either sample. A short heated line connects the FTIR cell to the 3-way valve in the manifold. Both sampling lines are continuously purged. Each sample line has a rotameter and a bypass vent line after the rotameter, immediately upstream of the valve, so that the spike and unspiked sample flows can each be continuously monitored. Begin
sampling by collecting spectra of 2 independent unspiked samples. Turn the sampling valve to close off the unspiked gas flow and allow the spiked flue gas to enter the FTIR cell. Isolate and evacuate the cell and fill with the spiked sample to ambient pressure. (While the evacuated cell is filling, prevent air leaks into the cell by making sure that the spike sample rotameter always indicates that a portion of the flow is directed out the by-pass vent.) Open the cell outlet valve to allow spiked sample to continuously flow through the cell. Measure spectra of 2 independent spiked samples. Repeat this procedure until at least 24 samples are collected.
11.1.1.3 Synchronized Measurements With Two Analyzers. Use two FTIR analyzers, each with its own cell, to perform synchronized spiked and unspiked measurements. If possible, use a similar optical configuration for both systems. The optical configurations are compared by measuring the same CTS gas with both analyzers. Each FTIR system uses its own sampling system including a separate sampling probe and sampling line. A common gas distribution manifold can be used if the samples are never mixed. One sampling system and analyzer measures spiked effluent. The other sampling system and analyzer measures unspiked flue gas. The two systems are synchronized so that each measures spectra at approximately the same times. The sample flow rates are also synchronized so that both sampling rates are approximately the same (TC
1
~ TC
2
in equation 1). Start both systems at the same time. Collect spectra of at least 12 independent samples with each (spiked and unspiked) system to obtain the minimum 24 measurements. Analyze the analytical results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. Run averages can be used in the statistical analysis instead of individual measurements.
11.1.1.4 Compare to a Reference Method (RM). Obtain EPA approval that the method qualifies as an RM for the analyte(s) and the source to be tested. Follow the published procedures for the RM in preparing and setting up equipment and sampling system, performing measurements, and reporting results. Since FTIR CEMS have multicomponent capability, it is possible to perform more than one RM simultaneously, one for each target analyte. Conduct at least 9 runs where the FTIR CEM and the RM are sampling simultaneously. Each Run is at least 30 minutes long and consists of spectra of at least 5 independent FTIR CEM samples and the corresponding RM measurements. If more than 9 runs are conducted, the analyst may eliminate up to 3 runs from the analysis if at least 9 runs are used.
11.1.1.4.1 RMs Using Integrated Sampling. Perform the RM and FTIR CEM sampling simultaneously. The FTIR CEM can measure spectra as frequently as the analyst chooses (and should obtain measurements as frequently as possible) provided that the measurements include spectra of at least 5 independent measurements every 30 minutes. Concentration results from all of the FTIR CEM spectra within a run may be averaged for use in the statistical comparison even if all of the measurements are not independent. When averaging the FTIR CEM concentrations within a run, it is permitted to exclude some measurements from the average provided the minimum of 5 independent measurements every 30 minutes are included: The Run average of the FTIR CEM measurements depends on both the sample flow rate and the measurement frequency (MF). The run average of the RM using the integrated sampling method depends primarily on its sampling rate. If the target analyte concentration fluctuates significantly, the contribution to the run average of a large fluctuation depends on the sampling rate and measurement frequency, and on the duration and magnitude of the fluctuation. It is, therefore, important to carefully select the sampling rate for both the FTIR CEM and the RM and the measurement frequency for the FTIR CEM. The minimum of 9 run averages can be compared according to the relative accuracy test procedure in Performance Specification 2 for SO
2
and NO
X
CEMs (40 CFR, Part 60, App. B).
11.1.1.4.2 RMs Using a Grab Sampling Technique. Synchronize the RM and FTIR CEM measurements as closely as possible. For a grab sampling RM, record the volume collected and the exact sampling period for each sample. Synchronize the FTIR CEM so that the FTIR measures a spectrum of a similar cell volume at the same time as the RM grab sample was collected. Measure at least five independent samples with both the FTIR CEM and the RM for each of the minimum nine runs. Compare the run concentration averages by using the relative accuracy analysis procedure in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60.
11.1.1.4.3 Continuous Emission Monitors as RMs. If the RM is a CEM, synchronize the sampling flow rates of the RM and the FTIR CEM. Each run is at least 1 hour long and consists of at least 10 FTIR CEM measurements and the corresponding 10 RM measurements (or averages). For the statistical comparison, use the relative accuracy analysis procedure in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. If the RM time constant is
1/2
the FTIR CEM time constant, brief fluctuations in analyte concentrations that are not adequately measured with the slower FTIR CEM time constant can be excluded from the run average along with the corresponding RM measurements. However, the FTIR CEM run average must still include at least 10 measurements over a 1-hour period.

ER17OC00.469
12.2 Statistical Analysis of Validation Measurements. Arrange the independent measurements (or measurement averages) as in Table 1. More than 12 pairs of measurements can be analyzed. The statistical analysis follows EPA Method 301, section 6.3. section 12.1 of this performance specification shows the calculations for the bias, expected spike concentration, and correction factor. This section shows the determination of the statistical significance of the bias. Determine the statistical significance of the bias at the 95 percent confidence level by calculating the t-value for the set of measurements. First, calculate the differences, d
i
, for each pair of spiked and each pair of unspiked measurements. Then calculate the standard deviation of the spiked pairs of measurements.

The t-statistic is calculated as follows to test the bias for statistical significance;
ER17OC00.473
where the bias, B, and the correction factor, CF, are given in section 12.1. For 11 degrees of freedom, and a one-tailed distribution, Method 301 requires that t ≤2.201. If the t-statistic indicates the bias is statistically significant, then analytical measurements must be multiplied by the correction factor. There is no limitation on the number of measurements, but there must be at least 12 independent spiked and 12 independent unspiked measurements. Refer to the t-distribution (Table 2) at the 95 percent confidence level and appropriate degrees of freedom for the critical t-value.

# Performance Specification 16—Specifications and Test Procedures for Predictive Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1
Does this performance specification apply to me?
If you, the source owner or operator, intend to use (with any necessary approvals) a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) to show compliance with your emission limitation under this part or 40 CFR part 61 or 63, you must use the procedures in this performance specification (PS) to determine whether your PEMS is acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. Use these procedures to certify your PEMS after initial installation and periodically thereafter to ensure the PEMS is operating properly. If your PEMS contains a diluent (O
2
or CO
2
) measuring component, the diluent component must be tested as well. These specifications apply to PEMS that are installed under 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63 after April 24, 2009.
1.1.1
How do I certify my PEMS after it is installed?
PEMS must pass a relative accuracy (RA) test and accompanying statistical tests in the initial certification test to be acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. Ongoing quality assurance tests also must be conducted to ensure the PEMS is operating properly. An ongoing sensor evaluation procedure must be in place before the PEMS certification is complete. The amount of testing and data validation that is required depends upon the regulatory needs,
i.e.
, whether precise quantification of emissions will be needed or whether indication of exceedances of some regulatory threshold will suffice. Performance criteria are more rigorous for PEMS used in determining continual compliance with an emission limit than those used to measure excess emissions. You must perform the initial certification test on your PEMS before reporting any PEMS data as quality-assured.
1.1.2
Is other testing required after certification?
After you initially certify your PEMS, you must pass additional periodic performance checks to ensure the long-term quality of data. These periodic checks are listed in the table in section 9. You are always responsible for properly maintaining and operating your PEMS.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
The following performance tests are required in addition to other equipment and measurement location requirements.
2.1 Initial PEMS Certification.
2.1.1 Excess Emissions PEMS. For a PEMS that is used for excess emission reporting, the owner or operator must perform a minimum 9-run, 3-level (3 runs at each level) RA test (see section 8.2).
2.1.2 Compliance PEMS. For a PEMS that is used for continual compliance standards, the owner or operator must perform a minimum 27-run, 3-level (9 runs at each level) RA test (see section 8.2). Additionally, the data must be evaluated for bias and by F-test and correlation analysis.
2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance (QA) Assessments. Owners and operators of all PEMS are required to conduct quarterly relative accuracy audits (RAA) and yearly relative accuracy test audits (RATA) to assess ongoing PEMS operation. The frequency of these periodic assessments may be shortened by successful operation during a prior year.

# 3.0 Definitions
The following definitions apply:
3.1
Centroidal Area
means that area in the center of the stack (or duct) comprising no more than 1 percent of the stack cross-sectional area and having the same geometric shape as the stack.
3.2
Data Recorder
means the equipment that provides a permanent record of the PEMS output. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities and may include electronic data records, paper records, or a combination of electronic data and paper records.
3.3
Defective sensor
means a sensor that is responsible for PEMS malfunction or that operates outside the approved operating envelope. A defective sensor may be functioning properly, but because it is operating outside the approved operating envelope, the resulting predicted emission is not validated.
3.4
Diluent PEMS
means the total equipment required to predict a diluent gas concentration or emission rate.
3.5
Operating envelope
means the defined range of a parameter input that is established during PEMS development. Emission data generated from parameter inputs that are beyond the operating envelope are not considered quality assured and are therefore unacceptable.
3.6
PEMS
means all of the equipment required to predict an emission concentration or emission rate. The system may consist of any of the following major subsystems: sensors and sensor interfaces, emission model, algorithm, or equation that uses process data to generate an output that is proportional to the emission concentration or emission rate, diluent emission model, data recorder, and sensor evaluation system. Systems that use fewer than 3 variables do not qualify as PEMS unless the system has been specifically approved by the Administrator for use as a PEMS. A PEMS may predict emissions data that are corrected for diluent if the relative accuracy and relevant QA tests are passed in the emission units corrected for diluent. Parametric monitoring systems that serve as indicators of compliance and have
parametric
limits but do not predict emissions to comply with an
emissions
limit are not included in this definition.
3.7
PEMS training
means the process of developing or confirming the operation of the PEMS against a reference method under specified conditions.
3.8
Quarter
means a quarter of a calendar year in which there are at least 168 unit operating hours.
3.9
Reconciled Process Data
means substitute data that are generated by a sensor evaluation system to replace that of a failed sensor. Reconciled process data may not be used without approval from the Administrator.
3.10
Relative Accuracy
means the accuracy of the PEMS when compared to a reference method (RM) at the source. The RA is the average difference between the pollutant PEMS and RM data for a specified number of comparison runs plus a 2.5 percent confidence coefficient, divided by the average of the RM tests. For a diluent PEMS, the RA may be expressed as a percentage of absolute difference between the PEMS and RM. Alternative specifications are given for units that have very low emissions.
3.11
Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA)
means a quarterly audit of the PEMS against a portable analyzer meeting the requirements of ASTM D6522-00 or a RM for a specified number of runs. A RM may be used in place of the portable analyzer for the RAA.
3.12
Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA)
means a RA test that is performed at least once every four calendar quarters after the initial certification test. The RATA shall be conducted as described in section 8.2 of this method.
3.13
Reference Value
means a PEMS baseline value that may be established by RM testing under conditions when all sensors are functioning properly. This reference value may then be used in the sensor evaluation system or in adjusting new sensors.
3.14
Sensor Evaluation System
means the equipment or procedure used to periodically assess the quality of sensor input data. This system may be a sub-model that periodically cross-checks sensor inputs among themselves or any other procedure that checks sensor integrity at least daily (when operated for more than one hour in any calendar day).
3.15
Sensors and Sensor Interface
means the equipment that measures the process input signals and transports them to the emission prediction system.

# 4.0 Interferences [Reserved]

# 5.0 Safety [Reserved]

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 PEMS Design. You must detail the design of your PEMS and make this available in reports and for on-site inspection. You must also establish the following, as applicable:
6.1.1 Number of Input Parameters. An acceptable PEMS will normally use three or more input parameters. You must obtain the Administrator's permission on a case-by-case basis if you desire to use a PEMS having fewer than three input parameters.
6.1.2 Parameter Operating Envelopes. Before you evaluate your PEMS through the certification test, you must specify the input parameters your PEMS uses, define their range of minimum and maximum values (operating envelope), and demonstrate the integrity of the parameter operating envelope
using graphs and data from the PEMS development process, vendor information, or engineering calculations, as appropriate. If you operate the PEMS beyond these envelopes at any time after the certification test, the data generated during this condition will not be acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. If these parameter operating envelopes are not clearly defined and supported by development data, the PEMS operation will be limited to the range of parameter inputs encountered during the certification test until the PEMS has a new operating envelope established.
6.1.3 Source-Specific Operating Conditions. Identify any source-specific operating conditions, such as fuel type, that affect the output of your PEMS. You may only use the PEMS under the source-specific operating conditions it was certified for.
6.1.4 Ambient Conditions. You must explain whether and how ambient conditions and seasonal changes affect your PEMS. Some parameters such as absolute ambient humidity cannot be manipulated during a test. The effect of ambient conditions such as humidity on the pollutant concentration must be determined and this effect extrapolated to include future anticipated conditions. Seasonal changes and their effects on the PEMS must be evaluated unless you can show that such effects are negligible.
6.1.5 PEMS Principle of Operation. If your PEMS is developed on the basis of known physical principles, you must identify the specific physical assumptions or mathematical manipulations that support its operation. If your PEMS is developed on the basis of linear or nonlinear regression analysis, you must make available the paired data (preferably in graphic form) used to develop or train the model.
6.1.6 Data Recorder Scale. If you are not using a digital recorder, you must choose a recorder scale that accurately captures the desired range of potential emissions. The lower limit of your data recorder's range must be no greater than 20 percent of the applicable emission standard (if subject to an emission standard). The upper limit of your data recorder's range must be determined using the following table. If you obtain approval first, you may use other lower and upper recorder limits.

6.1.7 Sensor Location and Repair. We recommend you install sensors in an accessible location in order to perform repairs and replacements. Permanently-installed platforms or ladders may not be needed. If you install sensors in an area that is not accessible, you may be required to shut down the emissions unit to repair or replace a sensor. Conduct a new RATA after replacing a sensor that supplies a critical PEMS parameter if the new sensor provides a different output or scaling or changes the historical training dataset of the PEMS. Replacement of a non-critical sensor that does not cause an impact in the accuracy of the PEMS does not trigger a RATA. All sensors must be calibrated as often as needed but at least as often as recommended by the manufacturers.
6.1.8 Sensor Evaluation System. Your PEMS must be designed to perform automatic or manual determination of defective sensors on at least a daily basis. This sensor evaluation system may consist of a sensor validation sub-model, a comparison of redundant sensors, a spot check of sensor input readings at a reference value, operation, or emission level, or other procedure that detects faulty or failed sensors. Some sensor evaluation systems generate substitute values (reconciled data) that are used when a sensor is perceived to have failed. You must obtain prior approval before using reconciled data.
6.1.9 Parameter Envelope Exceedances. Your PEMS must include a plan to detect and notify the operator of parameter envelope exceedances. Emission data collected outside the ranges of the sensor envelopes will not be considered quality assured.
6.2 Recordkeeping. All valid data recorded by the PEMS must be used to calculate the emission value.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards [Reserved]

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Initial Certification. Use the following procedure to certify your PEMS. Complete
all PEMS training before the certification begins.
8.2 Relative Accuracy Test.
8.2.1 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulations, you must use the test methods in appendix A of this part for the RM test. Conduct the RM tests at three operating levels. The RM tests shall be performed at a low-load (or production) level between the minimum safe, stable load and 50 percent of the maximum level load, at the mid-load level (an intermediary level between the low and high levels), and at a high-load level between 80 percent and the maximum load. Alternatively, if practicable, you may test at three levels of the key operating parameter (e.g. selected based on a covariance analysis between each parameter and the PEMS output) equally spaced within the normal range of the parameter.
8.2.2 Number of RM Tests for Excess Emission PEMS. For PEMS used for excess emission reporting, conduct at least the following number of RM tests at the following key parameter operating levels:
(1) Three at a low level.
(2) Three at a mid level.
(3) Three at a high level.
You may choose to perform more than nine total RM tests. If you perform more than nine tests, you may reject a maximum of three tests as long as the total number of test results used to determine the RA is nine or greater and each operating level has at least three tests. You must report all data, including the rejected data.
8.2.3 Number of RM Tests for Continual Compliance PEMS. For PEMS used to determine compliance, conduct at least the following number of RM tests at the following key parameter operating levels:
(1) Nine at a low level.
(2) Nine at a mid level.
(3) Nine at a high level.
You may choose to perform more than 9 RM runs at each operating level. If you perform more than 9 runs, you may reject a maximum of three runs per level as long as the total number of runs used to determine the RA at each operating level is 9 or greater.
8.2.4 Reference Method Measurement Location. Select an accessible measurement point for the RM that will ensure you measure emissions representatively. Ensure the location is at least two equivalent stack diameters downstream and half an equivalent diameter upstream from the nearest flow disturbance such as the control device, point of pollutant generation, or other place where the pollutant concentration or emission rate can change. You may use a half diameter downstream instead of the two diameters if you meet both of the following conditions:
(1) Changes in the pollutant concentration are caused solely by diluent leakage, such as leaks from air heaters.
(2) You measure pollutants and diluents simultaneously at the same locations.
8.2.5 Traverse Points. Select traverse points that ensure representative samples. Conduct all RM tests within 3 cm of each selected traverse point but no closer than 3 cm to the stack or duct wall. The minimum requirement for traverse points are as follows:
(1) Establish a measurement line across the stack that passes through the center and in the direction of any expected stratification.
(2) Locate a minimum of three traverse points on the line at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the stack inside diameter.
(3) Alternatively, if the stack inside diameter is greater than 2.4 meters, you may locate the three traverse points on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. You may not use this alternative option after wet scrubbers or at points where two streams with different pollutant concentrations are combined. You may select different traverse points if you demonstrate and provide verification that it provides a representative sample. You may also use the traverse point specifications given the RM.
8.2.6 Relative Accuracy Procedure. Perform the number of RA tests at the levels required in sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. For integrated samples (
e.g.
, Method 3A or 7E), make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for 7 minutes at each traverse point. For grab samples (
e.g.
, Method 3 or 7), take one sample at each traverse point, scheduling the grab samples so that they are taken simultaneously (within a 3-minute period) or at an equal interval of time apart over a 21-minute period. A test run for grab samples must be made up of at least three separate measurements. Where multiple fuels are used in the monitored unit and the fuel type affects the predicted emissions, determine a RA for each fuel unless the effects of the alternative fuel on predicted emissions or diluent were addressed in the model training process. The unit may only use fuels that have been evaluated this way.
8.2.7 Correlation of RM and PEMS Data. Mark the beginning and end of each RM test run (including the exact time of day) on the permanent record of PEMS output. Correlate the PEMS and the RM test data by the time and duration using the following steps:
A. Determine the integrated pollutant concentration for the PEMS for each corresponding RM test period.
B. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the pair of results is on a consistent moisture, temperature, and diluent concentration basis.
C. Compare each average PEMS value to the corresponding average RM value. Use the
following guidelines to make these comparisons.
If . . .
Then . . .
And then . . .
The RM has an instrumental or integrated non-instrumental sampling technique
Directly compare RM and PEMS results
The RM has a grab sampling technique
Average the results from all grab samples taken during the test run. The test run must include ≥3 separate grab measurements
Compare this average RM result with the PEMS result obtained during the run.
Use the paired PEMS and RM data and the equations in section 12.2 to calculate the RA in the units of the applicable emission standard. For this 3-level RA test, calculate the RA at each operation level.
8.3 Statistical Tests for PEMS that are Used for Continual Compliance. In addition to the RA determination, evaluate the paired RA and PEMS data using the following statistical tests.
8.3.1 Bias Test. From the RA data taken at the mid-level, determine if a bias exists between the RM and PEMS. Use the equations in section 12.3.1.
8.3.2 F-test. Perform a separate F-test for the RA paired data from each operating level to determine if the RM and PEMS variances differ by more than might be expected from chance. Use the equations in section 12.3.2.
8.3.3 Correlation Analysis. Perform a correlation analysis using the RA paired data from all operating levels combined to determine how well the RM and PEMS correlate. Use the equations in section 12.3.3. The correlation is waived if the process cannot be varied to produce a concentration change sufficient for a successful correlation test because of its technical design. In such cases, should a subsequent RATA identify a variation in the RM measured values by more than 30 percent, the waiver will not apply, and a correlation analysis test must be performed at the next RATA.
8.4 Reporting. Summarize in tabular form the results of the RA and statistical tests. Include all data sheets, calculations, and charts (records of PEMS responses) necessary to verify that your PEMS meets the performance specifications. Include in the report the documentation used to establish your PEMS parameter envelopes.
8.5 Reevaluating Your PEMS After a Failed Test, Change in Operations, or Change in Critical PEMS Parameter. After initial certification, if your PEMS fails to pass a quarterly RAA or yearly RATA, or if changes occur or are made that could result in a significant change in the emission rate (
e.g.
, turbine aging, process modification, new process operating modes, or changes to emission controls), your PEMS must be recertified using the tests and procedures in section 8.1. For example, if you initially developed your PEMS for the emissions unit operating at 80-100 percent of its range, you would have performed the initial test under these conditions. Later, if you wanted to operate the emission unit at 50-100 percent of its range, you must conduct another RA test and statistical tests, as applicable, to verify that the new conditions of 50-100 percent of range are functional. These tests must demonstrate that your PEMS provides acceptable data when operating in the new range or with the new critical PEMS parameter(s). The requirements of section 8.1 must be completed by the earlier of 60 unit operating days or 180 calendar days after the failed RATA or after the change that caused a significant change in emission rate.

# 9.0 Quality Control
You must incorporate a QA plan beyond the initial PEMS certification test to verify that your system is generating quality-assured data. The QA plan must include the components of this section.

9.3 Quarterly Relative Accuracy Audits. In the first year of operation after the initial certification, perform a RAA consisting of at least three 30-minute portable analyzer or RM determinations each quarter a RATA is not performed. To conduct a RAA, follow the procedures in Section 8.2 for the relative accuracy test, except that only three sets of measurement data are required, and the statistical tests are not required. The average of the three or more portable analyzer or RM determinations must not exceed the limits given in Section 13.5. Report the data from all sets of measurement data. If a PEMS passes all quarterly RAAs in the first year and also passes the subsequent yearly RATA in the second year, you may elect to perform a single mid-year RAA in the second year in place of the quarterly RAAs. This option may be repeated, but only until the PEMS fails either a mid-year RAA or a yearly RATA. When such a failure occurs, you must resume quarterly RAAs in the quarter following the failure and continue conducting quarterly RAAs until the PEMS successfully passes both a year of quarterly RAAs and a subsequent RATA.
9.4 Yearly Relative Accuracy Test. Perform a minimum 9-run RATA at the normal operating level on a yearly basis in the quarter that the RAA is not performed. The statistical tests in Section 8.3 are not required for the yearly RATA.

Finally, calculate the mean of the differences, standard deviation, confidence coefficient, and PEMS RA, using Equations 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, and 16-4, respectively. For compliance PEMS, calculate the RA at each test level. The PEMS must pass the RA criterion at each test level.

12.3 Compliance PEMS Statistical Tests. If your PEMS will be used for continual compliance purposes, conduct the following tests using the information obtained during the RA tests. For the pollutant measurements at any one test level, if the mean value of the RM is less than either 10 ppm or 5 percent of the emission standard, all statistical tests are waived at that specific test level. For diluent measurements at any one test level, if the mean value of the RM is less than 3 percent of span, all statistical tests are waived for that specific test level.
12.3.1 Bias Test. Conduct a bias test to determine if your PEMS is biased relative to the RM. Determine the PEMS bias by comparing the confidence coefficient obtained from Equation 16-3 to the arithmetic mean of the differences determined in Equation 16-1. If the arithmetic mean of the differences (d
) is greater than the absolute value of the confidence coefficient (cc), your PEMS must incorporate a bias factor to adjust future PEMS values as in Equation 16-5.

The critical value is obtained from Table 16-2 or a similar table for F-distribution. If the calculated F-value is greater than the critical value at any level, your proposed PEMS is unacceptable. For pollutant PEMS measurements, if the standard deviation of the RM is less than either 3 percent of the span or 5 ppm, use a RM standard deviation of either 5 ppm or 3 percent of span. For diluent PEMS measurements, if the standard deviation of the reference method is less than 3 percent of span, use a RM standard deviation of 3 percent of span.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 PEMS Relative Accuracy. The RA, calculated in units of the emission standard, must not exceed 10 percent if the PEMS measurements are greater than 100 ppm or 0.2 lbs/mm Btu. The RA must not exceed 20 percent if the PEMS measurements are between 100 ppm (or 0.2 lb/mm Btu) and 10 ppm (or 0.02 lb/mm Btu). For measurements below 10 ppm (or 0.02 lb/mm Btu), the absolute mean difference between the PEMS measurements and the RM measurements must not exceed 2 ppm (or 0.01 lb/mm Btu). For diluent only PEMS, an alternative criterion of ±1 percent absolute difference between the PEMS and RM may be used if less stringent.
13.2 PEMS Bias. Your PEMS data is considered biased and must be adjusted if the arithmetic mean (d) is greater than the absolute value of the confidence coefficient (cc) in Equations 16.1 and 16.3. In such cases, a bias factor must be used to correct your PEMS data.
13.3 PEMS Variance. Your calculated F-value must not be greater than the critical F-value at the 95-percent confidence level for your PEMS to be acceptable.
13.4 PEMS Correlation. Your calculated r-value must be greater than or equal to 0.8 for your PEMS to be acceptable.
13.5 Relative Accuracy Audits (RAA). The average of the three portable analyzer or RM determinations must not differ from the simultaneous PEMS average value by more than 10 percent of the analyzer or RM for concentrations greater than 100 ppm (or 0.2 lb/mm Btu) or 20 percent for concentrations between 100 ppm (or 0.2 lb/mm Btu) and 10 ppm (or 0.02 lb/mm Btu), or the test is failed. For measurements at 20 ppm (or 0.04 lb/mm Btu) or less, this difference must not exceed 2 ppm (or 0.01 lb/mm Btu) for a pollutant PEMS. For diluent PEMS, the difference must not exceed 1 percent.

# Performance Specification 17 [Reserved]
Pt. 60, App. B, Spec. 18

# Performance Specification 18—Performance Specifications and Test Procedures for Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride (HCI) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. This performance specification (PS) is applicable for measuring gaseous concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl), CAS: 7647-01-0, on a continuous basis in the units of the applicable standard or in units that can be converted to units of the applicable standard(s).
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This specification is used to evaluate the acceptability of HCl continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of
installation or soon after and whenever specified in the regulations. The specification includes requirements for initial acceptance including instrument accuracy and stability assessments and use of audit samples if they are available.
1.2.2 The Administrator may require the operator, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR part 60, §§ 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).
1.2.3 A source that demonstrates their CEMS meets the criteria of this PS may use the system to continuously monitor gaseous HCl under any regulation or permit that requires compliance with this PS. If your CEMS is capable of reporting the HCl concentration in the units of the applicable standard, no additional CEMS components are necessary. If your CEMS does not report concentrations in the units of the existing standard, then other CEMS components (
e.g.,
oxygen (O
2
), temperature, stack gas flow, moisture and pressure) may be necessary to convert the units reported by your CEMS to the units of the standard.
1.2.4 These specification test results are intended to be valid for the life of the system. As a result, the HCl measurement system must be tested and operated in a configuration consistent with the configuration that will be used for ongoing continuous emissions monitoring.
1.2.5 Substantive changes to the system configuration require retesting according to this PS. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to: major changes in dilution ratio (for dilution based systems); changes in sample conditioning and transport, if used, such as filtering device design or materials; changes in probe design or configuration and changes in materials of construction. Changes consistent with instrument manufacturer upgrade that fall under manufacturer's certification do not require additional field verification. Manufacturer's upgrades require recertification by the manufacturer for those requirements allowed by this PS, including interference, level of detection (LOD), and light intensity qualification.
1.2.6 This specification is not designed to evaluate the ongoing CEMS performance nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The requirements in appendix F, Procedure 6 are designed to provide a way to assess CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
2.1 This specification covers the procedures that each CEMS must meet during the performance evaluation test. Installation and measurement location specifications, data reduction procedures, and performance criteria are included.
2.2 The technology used to measure gaseous HCl must provide a distinct response and address any appropriate interference correction(s). It must accurately measure gaseous HCl in a representative sample (path or point sampling) of stack effluent.
2.3 The relative accuracy (RA) must be established against a reference method (RM) (
e.g.,
Method 26A, Method 320, ASTM International (ASTM) D6348-12, including mandatory annexes, or Method 321 for Portland cement plants as specified by the applicable regulation or, if not specified, as appropriate for the source concentration and category). Method 26 may be approved as a RM by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis if not otherwise allowed or denied in an applicable regulation.
2.4 A standard addition (SA) procedure using a reference standard is included in appendix A to this performance specification for use in verifying LOD. For extractive CEMS, where the SA is done by dynamic spiking (DS), the appendix A procedure is allowed as an option for assessing calibration drift and is also referenced by Procedure 6 of appendix F to this part for ongoing quality control tests.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Beam attenuation
is the reduction in electromagnetic radiation (light) throughput from the maximum beam intensity experienced during site specific CEMS operation.
3.2
Beam intensity
is the electromagnetic radiation (light) throughput for an IP-CEMS instrument measured following manufacturers specifications.
3.3
Calibration cell
means a gas containment cell used with cross stack or integrated path (IP) CEMS for calibration and to perform many of the test procedures required by this performance specification. The cell may be a removable sealed cell or an evacuated and/or purged cell capable of exchanging reference and other calibration gases as well as zero gas standards. When charged, it contains a known concentration of HCl and/or interference gases. The calibration cell is filled with zero gas or removed from the optical path during stack gas measurement.
3.4
Calibration drift
(CD) means the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and an upscale reference gas or a zero-level gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the CEMS is challenged after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled adjustments, maintenance or repairs took place.
3.5
Centroidal area
means a central area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 10
percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.
3.6
Continuous Emission Monitoring System
(CEMS) means the total equipment required to measure the pollutant concentration or emission rate continuously. The system generally consists of the following three major subsystems:
3.6.1
Sample interface
means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: Sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, defining the optical measurement path, and protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
3.6.2
HCl analyzer
means that portion of the HCl CEMS that measures the total vapor phase HCl concentration and generates a proportional output.
3.6.3
Data recorder
means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent electronic record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder may also include automatic data reduction capabilities and CEMS control capabilities.
3.7
Diluent gas
means a major gaseous constituent in a gaseous pollutant mixture. For combustion sources, either carbon dioxide (CO
2
) or oxygen (O
2
) or a combination of these two gases are the major gaseous diluents of interest.
3.8

(DS) means the procedure where a known concentration of HCl gas is injected into the probe sample gas stream for extractive CEMS at a known flow rate to assess the performance of the measurement system in the presence of potential interference from the flue gas sample matrix.
3.9
Independent measurement(s)
means the series of CEMS data values taken during sample gas analysis separated by two times the procedure specific response time (RT) of the CEMS.
3.10
Integrated path CEMS
(IP-CEMS) means an in-situ CEMS that measures the gas concentration along an optical path in the stack or duct cross section.
3.11
Interference
means a compound or material in the sample matrix other than HCl whose characteristics may bias the CEMS measurement (positively or negatively). The interference may not prevent the sample measurement, but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured HCl concentration through reaction with HCl or by changing the electronic signal generated during HCl measurement.
3.12
Interference test
means the test to detect CEMS responses to interferences that are not adequately accounted for in the calibration procedure and may cause measurement bias.
3.13
Level of detection
(LOD) means the lowest level of pollutant that the CEMS can detect in the presence of the source gas matrix interferents with 99 percent confidence.
3.14
Liquid evaporative standard
means a reference gas produced by vaporizing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable liquid standards of known HCl concentration and quantitatively diluting the resultant vapor with a carrier gas.
3.15
Measurement error
(ME) is the mean difference between the concentration measured by the CEMS and the known concentration of a reference gas standard, divided by the span, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged.
3.16
Optical path
means the route light travels from the light source to the receiver used to make sample measurements.
3.17
Path length
means, for an extractive optical CEMS, the distance in meters of the optical path within a gas measurement cell. For an IP-CEMS, path length means the distance in meters of the optical path that passes through the source gas in the stack or duct.
3.18

3.20
Reference gas standard
means a NIST-traceable gas standard containing a known concentration of HCl certified in accordance with an EPA traceability protocol in section 7.1 of this PS.
3.21
Relative accuracy
(RA) means the absolute mean difference between the gas concentration or the emission rate determined by the CEMS and the value determined by the RM, plus the confidence coefficient of a series of nine test runs, divided by the average of the RM or the applicable emission standard.
3.22
Response time
(RT) means the time it takes for the measurement system, while operating normally at its target sample flow rate, dilution ratio, or data collection rate to respond to a known step change in gas concentration, either from a low- or zero-level to a high-level gas concentration or from a high-level to a low or zero-level gas concentration, and to read 95 percent of the change to the stable instrument response. There may be several RTs for an instrument related to different functions or procedures (e.g., DS, LOD, and ME).

concentration equivalent to the emission standard unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation, permit or other requirement. Unless otherwise specified, the span may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5.
3.24
Standard addition
means the addition of known amounts of HCl gas (either statically or dynamically) to the actual measurement path or measured sample gas stream.

means a gas or liquid with an HCl concentration that is below the LOD of the measurement system.

# 4.0 Interferences
Sample gas interferences will vary depending on the instrument or technology used to make the measurement. Interferences must be evaluated through the interference test in this PS. Several compounds including carbon dioxide (CO
2
), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH
2
O), methane (CH
4
), and water (H
2
O) are potential optical interferences with certain types of HCl monitoring technology. Ammonia is a potential chemical interference with HCl.

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this PS may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This PS may not address all of the safety issues associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the RM should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
Equipment and supplies for CEMS will vary depending on the measurement technology and equipment vendors. This section provides a description of the equipment and supplies typically found in one or more types of CEMS.
6.1 Sample Extraction System. The portion of an extractive CEMS that collects and transports the sample to the pressure regulation and sample conditioning module. The extraction system must deliver a representative sample to the measurement instrument. The sample extraction system typically consists of a sample probe and a heated umbilical line.
6.2 Sample Conditioning Module. The portion of an extractive CEMS that removes particulate matter and moisture from the gas stream and provides a sample gas stream to the CEMS analysis module or analyzer. You must keep the particle-free gas sample above the dew point temperature of its components.
6.3 HClAnalyzer. The portion of the CEMS that detects, quantifies and generates an output proportional to the sample gas HCl concentration.
6.4 System Controller. The portion of the CEMS that provides control of the analyzer and other sub-systems (
e.g.,
sample extraction, sample conditioning, reference gas) as necessary for continuous operation and periodic maintenance/QC activities.
6.5 Data Recorder. The portion of the CEMS that provides a record of analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder output range must include the full range of expected HCl concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and span value.
6.6 Reference Gas System(s). Gas handling system(s) needed to introduce reference and other gases into the measurement system. For extractive CEMS, the system must be able to introduce gas flow sufficient to flood the sampling probe and prevent entry of gas from the effluent stream. For IP-CEMS, the system must be able to introduce a known concentration of HCl, at known cell length, pressure and temperature, into the optical path used to measure HCl gas concentration.
6.7 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured HCl emissions for moisture is required, you must install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: An FTIR system validated according to Method 301 or section 13.0 of Method 320 in appendix A to part 63 of this chapter; a continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring O
2
both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; a stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table,
i.e.,
a psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only); or other continuous moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or values), using measurements made with Method 4—Determination of Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A-3 to of this part. If this option is selected, the site-specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. At least nine Method 4 runs are required for determining each site-specific default moisture
percentage. Calculate each site-specific default moisture value by taking the arithmetic average of the Method 4 runs. Each site-specific moisture default value shall be updated whenever the current value is non-representative, due to changes in unit or process operation, but in any event no less frequently than annually.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Reference Gases. Reference gases (
e.g.,
cylinder gases or liquid evaporative standards) used to meet the requirements of this PS must be NIST certified or NIST-traceable and vendor certified to ±5.0 percent accuracy. HCl cylinder gases must be certified according to Reference 5 in section 16 of this PS through a documented unbroken chain of comparisons each contributing to the reported uncertainty. Liquid evaporative standards must be certified using the gravimetrically-based procedures of the latest version of the EPA Traceability Protocol for Qualification and Certification of Evaporative HCl Gas Standards and Humidification of HCl Gas Standards from Cylinders (
see
EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0696-0026.pdf).
7.2 Cylinder gas and/or liquid evaporative standards must be used within their certification periods.
7.3 High concentration cylinder gas or liquid evaporative HCl standards may be diluted for use in this specification. You must document the quantitative introduction of HCl standards into the system using Method 205, found in 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, or other procedure approved by the Administrator.

# 8.0 CEMS Measurement Location Specifications and Pretest Preparation
8.1 Prior to the start of your initial PS tests, you must ensure that the CEMS is installed according to the manufacturer's specifications and the requirements in this section. You may use either point or IP sampling technology.
8.2 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location where the pollutant concentration or emission rate measurements are directly representative of the HCl emissions or can be corrected so as to be representative of the total emissions from the affected facility. The CEMS need not be installed at the same location as the relative accuracy test location. If you fail the RA requirements in this specification due to the CEMS measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated.
8.2.1 Single point sample gas extraction should be (1) no less than 1.0 m (3.3 ft.) from the stack or duct wall or (2) within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
8.2.2 IP-CEMS measurements should (1) be conducted totally within the inner area bounded by a line 1.0 m (3.3 ft.) from the stack or duct wall, (2) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area, or (3) be located over any part of the centroidal area.
8.2.2.1 You must measure the IP-CEMS path length from the inner flange of the sampling ports or the inner end of the instrument insertion into the stack cavity using a laser tape measure, mechanical measurement tape, or similar device accurate to ±1.5 mm (0.059 in).
8.2.2.2 You must ensure that any purge flow used to protect IP-CEMS instrument windows from stack gas does not alter the measurement path length. Purge flow of less than or equal to 10 percent of the gas velocity in the duct meets this requirement.
8.2.3 CEMS and Data Recorder Scale Check. After CEMS installation, record and document the measurement range of the HCl CEMS. The CEMS operating range and the range of the data recording device must encompass all potential and expected HCl concentrations, including the concentration equivalent to the applicable emission limit and the span value.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization [Reserved]

# 11.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure
After completing the CEMS installation, setup and calibration, you must complete the PS test procedures in this section. You must perform the following procedures and meet the performance requirements for the initial demonstration of your CEMS:
a. Interference Test;
b. Beam Intensity Test (IP-CEMS only);
c. Temperature Verification Procedure (IP-CEMS only);
d. Pressure Verification Procedure (IP-CEMS only);
e. Level of Detection Determination;
f. Response Time Test;
g. Measurement Error Test;
h. Calibration Drift Test; and
i. Relative Accuracy Test.

# 11.1 Interference Test
11.1.1 Prior to its initial use in the field, you must demonstrate that your monitoring system meets the performance requirements of the interference test in section 13.5 to verify that the candidate system measures HCl accurately in the presence of common interferences in emission matrices.
11.1.2 Your interference test must be conducted in a controlled environment. The
equipment you test for interference must include the combination of the analyzer, related analysis software, and any sample conditioning equipment (
e.g.,
dilution module, moisture removal equipment or other interferent scrubber) used to control interferents.
11.1.3 If you own multiple measurement systems with components of the same make and model numbers, you need only perform this interference test on one analyzer and associated interference conditioning equipment combination. You may also rely on an interference test conducted by the manufacturer or a continuous measurement system integrator on a system having components of the same make and model(s) of the system that you use.
11.1.4 Perform the interference check using an HCl reference gas concentration of approximately five times the LOD.
11.1.5 Introduce the interference test gases listed in Table 1 in section 17.0 of this PS to the analyzer/conditioning system separately or in any combination. The interference test gases need not be of reference gas quality.
11.1.5.1 For extractive CEMS, the interference test gases may be introduced directly into the inlet to the analyzer/conditioning system after the probe extension coupling.
11.1.5.2 For IP-CEMS, the interference test gases may be added with the HCl in a calibration cell or separately in a temperature-controlled cell. The effective concentration of the gas in the cell must meet the requirements in Table 1 corrected for absolute pressure, temperature and the nominal stack sampling path length of the CEMS.
11.1.6 The interference test must be performed by combining an HCl reference gas with each interference test gas (or gas mixture). You must measure the baseline HCl response, followed by the response after adding the interference test gas(es) while maintaining a constant HCl concentration. You must perform each interference gas injection and evaluation in triplicate.

# Note:
The baseline HCl gas may include interference gases at concentrations typical of ambient air (
e.g.,
21 percent O
2
, 400 parts per million (ppm) CO
2
, 2 percent H
2
O), but these concentrations must be brought to the concentrations listed in Table 1 when their interference effects are being evaluated.
11.1.7 You should document the gas volume/rate, temperature, and pressure used to conduct the interference test. A gas blending system or manifold may be used.
11.1.8 Ensure the duration of each interference test is sufficient to condition the HCl measurement system surfaces before a stable measurement is obtained.
11.1.9 Measure the HCl response of the analyzer/sample conditioning system combination to the test gases in ppmv. Record the responses and determine the overall interference response using Table 2 in section 17.0.
11.1.10 For each interference gas (or mixture), calculate the mean difference (ΔMC
avg
) between the measurement system responses with and without the interference test gas(es) using Equation 1 in section 12.2. Summarize the results following the format contained in Table 2 in section 17.
11.1.11 Calculate the percent interference (I) for the gas runs using Equation 2 in section 12.2.
11.1.12 The total interference response (
i.e.,
the sum of the interference responses of all tested gaseous components) must not exceed the criteria set forth in section 13.5 of this PS.

# 11.2 Beam Intensity Test for IP-CEMS
11.2.1 For IP-CEMS, you must establish the tolerance of your system to beam intensity attenuation.
11.2.1.1 Your beam intensity test may be conducted in either a controlled environment or on-site during initial setup and demonstration of your CEMS.
11.2.1.2 If you have multiple measurement systems with components of the same make and model numbers, you need only perform this attenuation check on one system and you may also rely on an attenuation test conducted by the manufacturer on a system having components of the same make and model(s) of the system that you use.
11.2.2 Insert one or more neutral density filter(s) or otherwise attenuate the beam intensity by a known percentage (
e.g.,
90 percent of the beam intensity).
11.2.3 Perform a high-level HCl reference gas measurement.
11.2.4 Record and report the attenuated beam intensity, the measured HCl calibration gas concentration at full beam intensity, the measured HCl gas concentration with attenuated beam intensity, and the percent difference between the two HCl measurements with and without attenuation of the beam intensity. The percent difference must not exceed the criteria set forth in section 13.6 of this PS.
11.2.5 In the future, you may not operate your IP-CEMS at a beam intensity lower than that established based on the attenuation used during this test. However, you may repeat the test to establish a lower beam intensity limit or level.

# 11.3 Temperature Measurement Verification Procedure for IP-CEMS
11.3.1 Any measurement instrument or device that is used as a reference in verification of temperature measurement must have an accuracy that is traceable to NIST.
11.3.2 You must verify the temperature sensor used in IP-CEMS measurements on-site as part of the initial installation and verification procedures.
11.3.3 Comparison to Calibrated Temperature Measurement Device.
11.3.3.1 Place the sensor of a calibrated temperature reference device adjacent to the sensor used to measure stack temperature for your IP-CEMS. The calibrated temperature reference device must satisfy the accuracy requirements specified in Table 3 of this PS. The calibrated temperature reference device must also have a range equal to or greater than the range of your IP-CEMS temperature sensor.
11.3.3.2 Allow sufficient time for the response of the calibrated temperature reference device to reach equilibrium. With the process and control device operating under normal conditions, concurrently record the temperatures measured by your IP-CEMS system (M
t
) and the calibrated temperature reference device (V
t
). You must meet the accuracy requirements specified in section 13.7 of this PS.
11.3.3.3 If your IP-CEMS temperature sensor does not satisfy the accuracy requirement of this PS, check all system components and take any corrective action that is necessary to achieve the required minimum accuracy. Repeat this verification procedure until the accuracy requirement of this specification is satisfied.

# 11.4 Pressure Measurement Verification Procedure for IP-CEMS
11.4.1 For stack pressure measurement verification, you must select a NIST-traceable gauge or monitor that conforms to the design requirements of ASME B40.100-2010, “Pressure Gauges and Gauge Attachments,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) as a reference device.
11.4.2 As an alternative for a calibrated pressure reference device with NIST-traceable accuracy, you may use a water-in-glass U-tube manometer to verify your IP-CEMS pressure measurement equipment, provided there is also an accurate measurement of absolute atmospheric pressure at the manometer location.
11.4.3 Allow sufficient time for the response of the reference pressure measurement device to reach equilibrium. With the process and control device operating under normal conditions, concurrently record the pressures measured by your IP-CEMS system (M
P
) and the pressure reference device (V
p
). You must meet the accuracy requirements specified in section 13.8 of this PS.
11.4.4 If your IP-CEMS pressure sensor does not satisfy the accuracy requirement of this PS, check all system components and take any corrective action that is necessary to achieve the required minimum accuracy. Repeat this verification procedure until the accuracy requirement of this specification is satisfied.

# 11.5 Level of Detection Determination
11.5.1 You must determine the minimum amount of HCl that can be detected above the background in a representative gas matrix.
11.5.2 You must perform the LOD determination in a controlled environment such as a laboratory or manufacturer's facility.
11.5.3 You must add interference gases listed in Table 1 of this PS to a constant concentration of HCl reference gas.
11.5.3.1 You may not use an effective reference HCl gas concentration greater than five times the estimated instrument LOD.
11.5.3.2 For extractive CEMS, inject the HCl and interferents described in section 11.1.5 directly into the inlet to the analyzer.
11.5.3.3 For IP-CEMS, the HCl and interference test gases may be added to a calibration cell or separately in a temperature-controlled cell that is part of the measurement path. The effective concentration of the gas in the cell must meet the requirements in Table 1 corrected for absolute pressure, temperature and the nominal stack sampling path length of the CEMS.
11.5.4 Collect seven or more consecutive measurements separated by twice the RT (described in section 11.6) to determine the LOD.
11.5.5 Calculate the standard deviation of the measured values and define the LOD as three times the standard deviation of these measurements.
11.5.5.1 The LOD for extractive units must be determined and reported in ppmv.
11.5.5.2 The LOD for IP units must be determined and reported on a ppm-meter basis and the site- or installation-specific LOD must be calculated based on the actual measurement path length and gas density of the emissions at the specific site installation in ppmv.
11.5.6 You must verify the controlled environment LOD of section 11.5.2 of this PS for your CEMS during initial setup and field certification testing. You must use the SA procedure in appendix A of this PS with the following exceptions:
11.5.6.1 For the LOD verification in the field, you must make three independent SA measurements spiking the native source concentration by no more than three times the controlled environment LOD concentration determined in section 11.5.5.
11.5.6.2 For extractive CEMS, you must perform the SA as a dynamic spike by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other monitoring system components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical. For IP-CEMS, you must perform the SA procedure by adding or passing a known concentration reference gas
into a calibration cell in the optical path of the CEMS; you must also include the source measurement optical path while performing the SA measurement.
11.5.6.3 The amount detected, or standard addition response (SAR), is based on the average difference of the native HCl concentration in the stack or duct relative to the native stack concentration plus the SA. You must be able to detect the effective spike addition (ESA) above the native HCl present in the stack gas matrix. For extractive CEMS, the ESA is calculated using Equation A7 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, the ESA is calculated as C
i,eff
using Equation 4 of this PS.
11.5.6.4 For extractive CEMS, calculate the SAR using Equation A4 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, calculate the SAR using Equation A8.
11.5.6.5 If your system LOD field verification does not demonstrate a SAR greater than or equal to your initial controlled environment LOD, you must increase the SA concentration incrementally and repeat the field verification procedure until the SAR is equal to or greater than LOD. The site-specific standard addition detection level (SADL) is equal to the standard addition needed to achieve the acceptable SAR, and SADL replaces the controlled environment LOD. For extractive CEMS, the SADL is calculated as the ESA using Equation A7 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, the SADL is the SA calculated using Equation A8 in appendix A of this PS. As described in section 13.1 of this PS, the LOD or the SADL that replaces an LOD must be less than 20 percent of the applicable emission limit.

# 11.6 Response Time Determination. You must determine ME-, LOD- and SA-RT
11.6.1 For ME- or LOD-RT, start the upscale RT determination by injecting zero gas into the measurement system as required by the procedures in section 11.7 or 11.5, respectively. You may use humidified zero gas. For standard addition RT, start the upscale RT determination by measuring the native stack gas concentration of HCl.
11.6.1.1 For extractive CEMS measuring ME- or LOD-RT, the output has stabilized when there is no change greater than 1.0 percent of full scale for 30 seconds.
11.6.1.2 For standard addition RT that includes the stack gas matrix the final stable response may continue to vary by more than 1 percent, but may be considered stable if the variability is random and not continuously rising or falling.
11.6.2 When the CEMS output has stabilized, record the response in ppmv and introduce an upscale (high level) or spike reference gas as required by the relevant procedure.
11.6.3 Record the time (upscale RT) required to reach 95 percent of the change to the final stable value.
11.6.4 Next, for ME or LOD RT, reintroduce the zero gas and record the time required to reach 95 percent of the change to the stable instrument response at the zero gas reading. For SA RT, introduce zero gas to the IP-CEMS cell or stop the spike gas flow to the extractive CEMS as required by the specified procedure and record the time required to reach 95 percent of the change to the stable instrument response of the native gas reading. This time is the downscale RT.
(
Note:
For CEMS that perform a series of operations (purge, blow back, sample integration, analyze, etc.), you must start adding reference or zero gas immediately after these procedures are complete.)
11.6.5 Repeat the entire procedure until you have three sets of data, then determine the mean upscale and mean downscale RTs for each relevant procedure. Report the greater of the average upscale or average downscale RTs as the RT for the system.

# 11.7 Measurement Error (ME) Test
11.7.1 On the same day and as close in time as practicable to when the ME test is conducted, perform and meet requirements for a calibration drift (CD) test using a zero gas as used in the Seven-Day Drift Test (see section 11.8) and document and report the results. To meet this requirement, the ME test may be conducted during the Seven-Day CD Test.
11.7.2 Extractive CEMS ME Test.
11.7.2.1 Introduce reference gases to the CEMS probe, prior to the sample conditioning and filtration system.
11.7.2.2 Measure three upscale HCl reference gas concentrations in the range shown in Table 4 of this PS.
11.7.2.3 Introduce the gases into the sampling probe with sufficient flow rate to replace the entire source gas sample.
11.7.2.4 Continue to add the reference gas until the response is stable as evidenced when the difference between two consecutive measurements is less than the LOD or within five percent of each other.
11.7.2.5 Make triplicate measurements for each reference gas for a total of nine measurements. Introduce different reference gas concentrations in any order but do not introduce the same gas concentration twice in succession.
11.7.2.6 At each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses (
MC
l
). Calculate the ME using Equation 3A in section 12.3.
11.7.2.7 If you desire to determine the system RT during this test, you must inject zero gas immediately before and after each injection of the high-level gas standard.
11.7.2.8 For non-dilution systems, you may adjust the system to maintain the correct flow rate at the analyzer during the test, but you may not make adjustments for any other purpose. For dilution systems, you must operate the measurement system at the appropriate dilution ratio during all system ME checks, and you may make only the adjustments necessary to maintain the proper ratio.
11.7.3 IP-CEMS ME Test.
11.7.3.1 Conduct a 3-level system ME test by individually adding the known concentrations of HCl reference gases into a calibration cell of known volume, temperature, pressure and path length.
Note:
The optical path used for IP-CEMS ME checks must include the native HCl measurement path. You must also collect native stack concentration HCl measurements before and after each HCl standard measurement. Bracketing HCl reference gas measurements with native stack HCl measurements must be used in the calculations in Equation 5 in section 12.4.2 to correct the upscale measurements for stack gas HCl concentration changes.
11.7.3.2 Introduce HCl reference gas into your calibration cell in a range of concentrations that produce responses equivalent to the source concentrations shown in Table 4 of this PS for your path length.
11.7.3.3 Make triplicate measurements for each reference gas standard for a total of nine measurements. Introduce different calibration concentrations in any order but do not introduce the same reference gas concentration twice in succession.
11.7.3.4 You must calculate the effective concentration (C
i,eff
) of the HCl reference gas equivalent to the stack concentration by correcting for calibration cell temperature, pressure, path length, line strength factor (LSF) and, if necessary, the native stack gas HCl concentration using Equation 4 in section 12.0.
11.7.3.5 You may use the LSF provided by your instrument manufacturer or determine an instrument-specific LSF as a function of temperature using a heated gas cell and equivalent concentrations (C
i,eff
) between 50 and 150 percent of the emission limit.
11.7.3.6 At each reference gas concentration, average the three independent CEMS measurement responses corrected for native HCl stack concentration. Calculate the ME using Equation 6A in section 12.4.3.
11.7.4 You may use Figure 1 in section 17.0 to record and report your ME test results.
11.7.5 If the ME specification in section 13.3 is not met for all three reference gas concentrations, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-level ME test is achieved.

# 11.8 Seven-Day Calibration Drift (CD) Test
11.8.1 The CD Test Period. Prior to the start of the RA tests, you must perform a seven-day CD test. The purpose of the seven-day CD test is to verify the ability of the CEMS to maintain calibration for each of seven consecutive unit operating days as specified in section 11.8.5 of this PS.
11.8.2 The CD tests must be performed using the zero gas and mid-level reference gas standards as defined in Table 4 of this PS.
11.8.3 Conduct the CD test on each day during continuous operation of the CEMS and normal facility operations following the procedures in section 11.7 of this PS, except that the zero gas and mid-level gas need only be introduced to the measurement system once each.
11.8.4 If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and upscale response factor settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments.

# Note:
Automatic signal or mathematical processing of all measurement data to determine emission results may be performed throughout the entire CD process.
11.8.5 Determine the magnitude of the CD at approximately 24-hour intervals, for 7 consecutive unit operating days. The 7 consecutive unit operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days.
11.8.6 Record the CEMS response for single measurements of zero gas and mid-level reference gas. You may use Figure 2 in section 17 of this PS to record and report the results of your 7-day CD test.
11.8.6.1 For extractive CEMS, calculate the CD using Equation 3B in section 12.3. Report the absolute value of the differences as a percentage of the span value.
11.8.6.2 For IP-CEMS, you must include the source measurement optical path while performing the upscale CD measurement; you may exclude the source measurement optical path when determining the zero gas concentration. Calculate the CD for IP CEMS using equations 4, 5, 6B, and 7 in section 12.4.
11.8.7 The zero-level and mid-level CD for each day must be less than 5.0 percent of the span value as specified in section 13.2 of this PS. You must meet this criterion for 7 consecutive operating days.
11.8.8 Dynamic Spiking Option for Seven-Day CD Test. For extractive CEMS, you have the option to conduct a mid-level dynamic spiking procedure for each of the 7 days in lieu of the mid-level reference gas injection described in sections 11.8.2 and 11.8.3. If this option is selected, the daily zero CD check is still required.
11.8.8.1 To conduct each of the seven daily mid-level dynamic spikes, you must use the DS procedure described in appendix A of this
PS using a single spike of the mid-level reference gas (
see
Table 4).
11.8.8.2 You must perform the dynamic spike procedure by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other monitoring system components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical.
11.8.8.3 Calculate the mid-level CD as a percent of span using Equation A6 of appendix A to this PS and calculate the zero drift using Equation 3B in section 12.3. Record and report the results as described in sections 11.8.6 and 11.8.7.

# 11.9 Relative Accuracy Test
11.9.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation, use Method 26A in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, Method 320 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or ASTM D6348-12 including all annexes, as applicable, as the RMs for HCl measurement. Obtain and analyze RM audit samples, if they are available, concurrently with RM test samples according to the same procedure specified for performance tests in the general provisions of the applicable part. If Method 26 is not specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations, you may request approval to use Method 26 in appendix A-8 to this part as the RM on a site-specific basis under §§ 63.7(f) or 60.8(b). Other RMs for moisture, O
2
, etc., may be necessary. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be compared to the CEMS data.
11.9.1.1 When Method 26A is used as the RM, you must sample sufficient gas to reach three times your method detection limit for Method 26A in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, or for a minimum of one hour, whichever is greater.
11.9.1.2 When Method 320 or Method 321, both found in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or ASTM D6348-12, are used as the RM, you must collect gas samples that are at stack conditions (hot and wet) and you must traverse as required in section 11.9.3.
11.9.2 Conduct the diluent (if applicable), moisture (if needed), and pollutant measurements simultaneously. However, diluent and moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the pollutant measurements may be used to calculate dry pollutant concentration and emission rates.
11.9.3 Reference Method Measurement Location and Traverse Point(s) Selection.
11.9.3.1 Measurement Location. Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement location at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur, and at least one half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or a control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (
e.g.,
air heater leakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at the same location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. The CEMS and RM sampling locations need not be the same.
11.9.3.2 Traverse Point Selection. Select traverse points that assure acquisition of representative RM samples over the stack or duct cross section according to one of the following options: (a) sample at twelve traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part, (b) sample at 6 Method 1 traverse points according to section 6.5.6(b)(1) of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, or (c) sample at three points on a measurement line (“3-point long line”) that passes through the centroidal area of the duct in the direction of any potential stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, you may displace the line up to 20 cm (12 in.) or 5.0 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less, from the centroidal area. Locate the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. Alternatively, you may conduct a stratification test following the procedures in sections 11.9.3.2.1 through 11.9.3.2.4 to justify sampling at a single point or three points located on the measurement line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 m from the stack wall (“3-point short line”). Stratification testing must be conducted at the sampling location to be used for the RM measurements during the RA test and must be made during normal facility operating conditions. You must evaluate the stratification by measuring the gas on the same moisture basis as the HCl CEMS (wet or dry). Stratification testing must be repeated for each RA test program to justify single point or “3-point short line” sampling.
11.9.3.2.1 Use a probe of appropriate length to measure the HCl concentration or an alternative analyte, as described in this section, using 12 traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60 for a circular stack or nine points at the centroids of similarly-shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section of a rectangular stack.
11.9.3.2.2 You may substitute a stratification test for SO
2
for the HCl stratification test. If you select this option, you must follow the test procedures in Method 6C of appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60 or Method 320 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63.
11.9.3.2.3 Calculate the mean measured concentration for all sampling points (MN
avg
).
11.9.3.2.4 Calculate the percent stratification (S
t
) of each traverse point using Equation 8 in section 12.5.
11.9.3.2.5 The gas stream is considered to be unstratified and you may perform the RA testing at a single point that most closely matches the mean if the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by: (a) No more than 5.0 percent of the mean concentration; or (b) 0.2 ppm (for HCl) or 3 ppm (for SO
2
) absolute, whichever is less restrictive.
11.9.3.2.6 If the criterion for single point sampling (5.0 percent, 0.2 ppm for HCl or 3 ppm for SO
2
are not met, but the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than 10.0 percent of the mean, the gas stream is considered to be minimally stratified, and you may take RA samples using the “3-point short line”. Alternatively, you may use the 3-point short line if each traverse point differs from the mean value by no more than 0.4 ppm (for HCl) or 5 ppm (for SO
2
).
11.9.3.2.7 If the concentration at any traverse point differs from the mean concentration by more than 10 percent, the gas stream is considered stratified and you must sample using one of the options in section 11.9.3.2 above.
11.9.3.3 Conduct all necessary RM tests within 3 cm (1.2 in.) of the traverse points, but no closer than 3 cm (1.2 in.) to the stack or duct wall.
11.9.4 In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, record the beginning and end of each RM run (including the time of day in hours, minutes, and seconds) using a clock synchronized with the CEM clock used to create a permanent time record with the CEMS output.
11.9.5 You must conduct the RATA during representative process and control operating conditions or as specified in an applicable regulation, permit or subpart.
11.9.6 Conduct a minimum of nine RM test runs.
NOTE:
More than nine RM test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, up to three test run results may be excluded so long as the total number of test run results used to determine the CEMS RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported including the excluded test runs.
11.9.7 Analyze the results from the RM test runs using Equations 9-14 in section 12.6. Calculate the RA between the CEMS results and the RM.

# 11.10 Record Keeping and Reporting
11.10.1 For systems that use a liquid evaporative standard generator to deliver HCl reference gas standards, record supporting data for these devices, including liquid feed calibrations, liquid standard concentration(s) and NIST-traceability, feed rate and gas flow calibrations for all diluent and HCl gas flows. All calibrations must include a stated uncertainty, and the combined uncertainty of the delivered HCl reference gas concentration must be calculated and reported.
11.10.2 Record the results of the CD test, the RT test, the ME test, the RA test, and for IP-CEMS, the results of the beam intensity, temperature and pressure verification procedures. Also keep records of the RM and CEMS field data, calculations, and reference gas certifications necessary to confirm that the performance of the CEMS met the performance specifications.
11.10.3 For systems that use Method 205 to prepare HCl reference gas standards, record results of Method 205 performance test field evaluation, reference gas certifications, and gas dilution system calibration.
11.10.4 Record the LOD for the CEMS. For extractive CEMS, record the LOD in ppmv. For IP-CEMS, record the LOD on a ppm-meter basis along with a calculation of the installation specific LOD in ppmv. For both CEMS types, you must also record the field verified SADL.
11.10.5 Record the results of the interference test.
11.10.6 Report the results of all certification tests to the appropriate regulatory agency (or agencies), in hardcopy and/or electronic format, as required by the applicable regulation or permit.

# PS-18 Appendix A Standard Addition Procedures

# 1.0
Scope and Application
1.1 This appendix to Performance Specification (PS) 18 describes the procedure and performance requirements for standard addition (SA) as a quality check for hydrogen chloride (HCl) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS).
1.2 This appendix is applicable to quality checks of both extractive and integrated path (IP) technologies used to measure HCl emissions.
1.3 For extractive CEMS, this procedure must be used, as a level of detection (LOD) verification of all field-installed CEMS. Additionally, it is allowed by Procedure 6 in appendix F to this part as an alternative to upscale calibration drift (CD) tests, cylinder gas audits and relative accuracy audits (RAAs), and may be used for quality assurance purposes under other applicable regulations or permits that require HCl monitoring.
1.4 For IP-CEMS, this procedure must be used as a LOD verification of all field-installed CEMS.

# 2.0 Summary of the Appendix for Standard Addition
As used here, SA is a gas phase method of standard additions (either static or dynamic) used to verify the accuracy of CEMS measurements in the presence of the sample matrix. For extractive CEMS, it consists of spiking a known quantity of HCl dynamically into the measurement system as an addition to the native HCl and the native source gas matrix. For IP-CEMS, this procedure consists of introducing a known quantity of HCl into the optical path that also includes the native source gas.

Interferences.

# Interferences are discussed in PS-18, section 4.0
5.0
Safety.
The procedures required under this appendix may involve hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This procedure may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. You as the facility or operator must establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. As the CEMS user, you should consult instrument operation manuals, material safety data sheets, compressed gas safety requirements, and other Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations for specific precautions to be taken.
6.0
Equipment and Supplies.
An example of equipment and supplies is described in section 6 of PS-18.
7.0
Reagents and Standards.
SA materials must meet the requirements defined for reference gases in section 7 of PS-18 to perform this procedure with the following exception. You may use gases certified by the gas vendor to ±5 percent to perform the daily calibration drift assessment in section 4.1 of Procedure 6 in appendix F of this part.

# Note:
For extractive CEMS the concentrations of reference gases required for SA are likely to be significantly higher than the concentration of reference gases associated with PS-18 requirements.
8.0
Standard Addition and Dynamic Spiking Procedure.
The standard addition procedure consists of measuring the native source gas concentration, addition of reference gas, and measurement of the resulting SA elevated source gas concentration. For extractive CEMS, HCl is spiked dynamically and thus, one must account for the dilution of sample gas from the addition of the HCl reference gas. For IP-CEMS, standard addition of an HCl reference gas is made by either adding an HCl reference gas to a flow through cell or inserting a sealed reference gas cell into the measurement path of the CEMS. The enclosed cell or a fixed cell must contain an HCl concentration that accounts for the difference in path length of the cell used for SA relative to the measurement path.
8.1 SA Concentration and Measurement Replicates.
8.1.1 You must inject HCl gas to create a measured concentration based on the requirements of the particular performance test (
e.g.,
LOD verification, CD, DSA).
8.1.2 Each dynamic spike (DS) or standard addition (SA) replicate consists of a measurement of the source emissions concentration of HCl (native stack concentration) with and without the addition of HCl. With a single CEMS, you must alternate the measurement of the native and SA-elevated source gas so that each measurement of SA-elevated source gas is immediately preceded and followed by a measurement of native stack gas. Introduce the SA gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Alternatively, you may use an independent continuous HCl monitor to measure the native source concentration before and after each standard addition as described in section 8.1.4.
8.1.3 Unless specified otherwise by an applicable rule, your SA-elevated concentration may not exceed 100 percent of span when the SA and native HCl concentration are combined.
8.1.4 As an alternative to making background measurements pre- and post-SA, you may use an independent continuous HCl monitor as a temporary unit to measure native stack HCl concentration while simultaneously using the CEMS to measure the SA-elevated source concentration. If you use an independent continuous HCl monitor you must make one concurrent background or native HCl measurement using both the installed CEMS and the independent continuous HCl monitor, immediately before the SA procedure in section 8.2 or 8.3 begins, to confirm that the independent monitoring system measures the same background concentration as the CEMS being qualified with this PS.
8.2 SA Procedure for Extractive CEMS (Dynamic Spiking)
8.2.1 Your HCl spike addition must not alter the total volumetric sample system flow rate or basic dilution ratio of your CEMS (if applicable).
8.2.2 Your spike gas flow rate must not contribute more than 10 percent of the total volumetric flow rate through the CEMS.
8.2.3 You must determine a dilution factor (DF) or relative concentration of HCl for each dynamic spike. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters accurate to within 2.0 percent or highly accurate tracer gas measurements are required to make the necessary DF determinations at the accuracy required for this PS. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters (
e.g.,
venturi, orifice) accurate to within 2.0 percent should be recertified against an NIST-traceable flow meter annually.
Note:
Since the spiking mass balance calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the DF determination, the accuracy of measurements required to determine the total volumetric gas flow rate, spike gas flow rate, or tracer gas standard addition concentration is critical to your ability to accurately perform the DS procedure and calculate the results.
8.2.4 You must monitor and record the total sampling system flow rate and sample dilution factor (DF) for the spiking and stack gas sampling systems to ensure they are known and do not change during the spiking procedure. Record all data on a data sheet similar to Table A1 in section 13 of this appendix.
8.2.4.1 You may either measure the spike gas flow and the total flow with calibrated flow meters capable of NIST traceable accuracy to ±2.0 percent or calculate the flow using a stable tracer gas included in your spike gas standard.
8.2.4.2 If you use flow measurements to determine the spike dilution, then use Equation A1 in section 11.2.1 of this appendix to calculate the DF. Determination of the spike dilution requires measurement of HCl spike flow (Q
spike
) and total flow through the CEM sampling system (Q
probe
).
8.2.4.3 If your CEMS is capable of measuring an independent stable tracer gas, you may use a spike gas that includes the tracer to determine the DF using Equation A2 or A3 (sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3 of this appendix) depending on whether the tracer gas is also present in the native source emissions.
8.2.4.4 For extractive CEMS, you must correct the background measurements of HCl for the dilution caused by the addition of the spike gas standard. For spiking systems that alternate between addition of HCl and zero gas at a constant DF, the background measurements between spikes will not be equal to the native source concentration.
8.2.5 Begin by collecting unspiked sample measurements of HCl. You must use the average of two unspiked sample measurements as your pre-spike background.

# Note:
Measurements should agree within 5.0 percent or three times the level of detection to avoid biasing the spike results.
8.2.5.1 Introduce the HCl gas spike into the permanent CEMS probe, upstream of the particulate filter or sample conditioning system and as close to the sampling inlet as practical.
8.2.5.2 Maintain the HCl gas spike for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native plus spiked HCl concentration.
8.2.5.3 Stop the flow of spike gas for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native HCl concentration.
8.2.6 Repeat the collection of sample measurements in section 8.2.5 until you have data for each spike concentration including a final set of unspiked sample measurements according to section 8.2.5.3.
8.2.7 Verify that the CEMS responded as expected for each spike gas injection, and that the data quality is not impacted by large shifts in the native source concentration. Discard and repeat any spike injections as necessary to generate a complete set of the required replicate spike measurements.
8.2.8 Calculate the standard addition response (SAR) for extractive CEMS, using Equation A4 in section 11.2, of this appendix.
8.2.9 If the DS results do not meet the specifications for the appropriate performance test in PS-18 or Procedure 6 of appendix F of this part, you must take corrective action and repeat the DS procedure.
8.3 SA Procedure for IP-CEMS (Static Spiking).
8.3.1 For IP-CEMS, you must make measurements of native source gas HCl concentration and an HCl standard addition using a calibration cell added to the optical measurement path.
8.3.2 Introduce zero gas into a calibration cell located in the optical measurement path of the instrument. Continue to flush the zero gas into the cell for at least the SA response time of your CEMS or until two consecutive measurements taken are within 5.0 percent, then collect two independent measurements. Alternatively you may measure native concentrations without the calibration cell in the optical path.
8.3.3 Introduce the HCl spike gas into the calibration cell. Continue to flush the spike gas into the cell for at least the SA response time of your CEMS or until two consecutive measurements taken are within 5.0 percent of one another. Then collect two independent measurements of the SA addition to the native concentration. Alternatively you may insert a sealed calibration cell, containing HCl at the appropriate concentration, into the optical path to measure the SA addition to the native concentration.
8.3.4 Repeat the collection of SA-elevated and native HCl measurements in sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3 until you have data for each SA concentration. Then, make a final native HCl measurement. The measured concentrations must be corrected for calibration cell and stack temperature, pressure and stack measurement path length.
8.3.5 Calculate the standard addition response (SAR) for an IP-CEMS, using Equation A8 in section 11.3 of this appendix.
8.3.6 If the SA results do not meet the specifications for the appropriate performance test in PS-18 or Procedure 6 of appendix F of this part, you must take corrective action and repeat the SA procedure.

# Performance Specification 19-Performance Specifications and Test Procedures for Ethylene Oxide (ETO) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analyte. This performance specification (PS) is applicable for measuring gaseous concentrations of Ethylene Oxide (EtO), CAS: 775-21-8, on a continuous basis in the units of the applicable standard or in units that can be converted to units of the applicable standard(s) (
e.g.,
lbs/hr,). This performance specification may be approved for the measurement of other pollutants and/or in other sectors by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis if not otherwise allowed or denied in an applicable subpart of the regulations.
1.2 Applicability.
1.2.1 This specification is used to evaluate the acceptability of EtO continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of installation or soon after and whenever specified in the regulations. The specification includes requirements for initial acceptance including instrument accuracy and stability assessments and use of audit samples if they are available.
1.2.2 The Administrator may require the operator, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR part 60, § 60.13(c) and § 63.8(e)(1).
1.2.3 A source that demonstrates their CEMS meets the criteria of this PS may use the system to continuously monitor gaseous EtO under any regulation or permit that requires compliance with this PS. If your CEMS reports the EtO concentration in the units of the applicable standard, no additional CEMS components are necessary. If your CEMS does not report concentrations in the units of the existing standard, then other CEMS (
i.e.,
oxygen) or CEMS components (
e.g.,
temperature, stack gas flow, moisture, and pressure) may be necessary to convert the units reported by your CEMS to the units of the standard.
1.2.4 These specification test results are intended to be valid for the life of the system. As a result, the EtO measurement system must be tested and operated in a configuration consistent with the configuration that will be used for ongoing continuous emissions monitoring.
1.2.5 Substantive changes to the system configuration require retesting according to this PS. Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to: major changes in dilution ratio (for dilution-based systems); changes in sample conditioning and transport, if used, such as filtering device design or materials; changes in probe design or configuration and changes in materials of construction. Changes consistent with instrument manufacturer upgrade that fall under manufacturer's certification do not require additional field verification. Manufacturer's upgrades (
e.g.,
changes to the quantification algorithm) require recertification by the manufacturer for those requirements allowed by this PS, including interference, and level of detection (LOD).
1.2.6 This specification is not designed to evaluate the ongoing CEMS performance, nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The requirements in Procedure 7 to Appendix F of this part are designed to provide a way to assess CEMS and CEMS components (if applicable) performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly.

# 2.0 Summary of Performance Specification
2.1 This specification covers the procedures that each EtO CEMS must meet during the performance evaluation test. Installation and measurement location specifications, data reduction procedures, and performance criteria are included.
2.2 The technology used to measure EtO must provide a distinct response and address any appropriate interference correction(s). It must accurately measure EtO in a representative sample of stack effluent.
2.3 The relative accuracy (RA) must be established against a reference method (RM) (
i.e.,
Method 320, or other alternative approved as a RM by the Administrator) on a case-by-case basis if not otherwise allowed or denied in an applicable subpart of the regulations.
2.4 A standard addition (SA) procedure using a reference standard is included in appendix A to this performance specification for use in verifying LOD. For extractive CEMS, where the SA is done by dynamic spiking (DS), the appendix A procedure is allowed as an option for assessing calibration drift and is also referenced by Procedure 7 of appendix F to this part for ongoing quality control tests.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1
Calibration drift
(CD) means the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and an upscale reference gas or a zero-level gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the CEMS is challenged after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled adjustments, maintenance or repairs took place. For other parameters that are selectively measured by the CEMS (
e.g.,
temperature, velocity, pressure, flow rate) to measure in the units of the applicable standard, use two analogous values (
e.g.,
Low: 0-20% of
full scale, High: 50-100% of full scale). 3.2
Calibration Span
means the calibrated portion of the measurement range as specified in the applicable regulation or another requirement. If the span is not specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement, then it must be a value approximately equivalent to three times the applicable emission standard. When the emission standard is expressed as mass emissions, use the average flow rate in the duct to calculate the concentration equivalent of the emission standard.
3.3
Centroidal area
means a central area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 10 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.
3.4
Continuous Emission Monitoring System
(CEMS) means the total equipment required to measure the pollutant concentration or emission rate continuously. The system generally consists of the following three major subsystems:
3.4.1
Sample interface
means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: Sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, and protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
3.4.2
EtO analyzer
means that portion of the EtO CEMS that measures the total vapor phase EtO concentration and generates a proportional output.
3.4.3
Data recorder
means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent electronic record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder may also include automatic data reduction capabilities and CEMS control capabilities.
3.5
Diluent gas
means a major gaseous constituent in a gaseous pollutant mixture. For combustion sources, either carbon dioxide (CO
2
) or oxygen (O
2
) or a combination of these two gases are the major gaseous diluents of interest.
3.6
Dynamic spiking (DS)
means the procedure where a known concentration of EtO gas is injected into the probe sample gas stream for extractive CEMS at a known flow rate to assess the performance of the measurement system in the presence of potential interference from the flue gas sample matrix.
3.7
Flow Rate Sensor
means that portion of the CEMS that senses the volumetric flow rate and generates an output proportional to that flow rate. The flow rate sensor shall have provisions to check the CD for each flow rate parameter that it measures individually (
e.g.,
velocity, pressure).
3.8
Independent measurement(s)
means the series of CEMS data values taken during sample gas analysis separated by two times the procedure specific response time (RT) of the CEMS.
3.9
Interference
means a compound or material in the sample matrix other than EtO whose characteristics may bias the CEMS measurement (positively or negatively). The interference may not prevent the sample measurement but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured EtO concentration through reaction with EtO or by changing the electronic signal generated during EtO measurement.
3.10
Interference test
means the test to detect CEMS responses to interferences that are not adequately accounted for in the calibration procedure and may cause measurement bias.
3.11
Level of detection (LOD)
means the lowest level of pollutant that the CEMS can detect in the presence of the source gas matrix interferents with 99 percent confidence.
3.12
Measurement error (ME)
is the mean difference between the concentration measured by the CEMS and the known concentration of a reference gas standard, divided by the span, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged.
3.13
Reference gas standard
means the gas mixture containing EtO at a known concentration and produced and certified in accordance with “EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards,” September 1997, as amended August 25, 1999, EPA-600/R-97/121 or more recent updates. The tests for analyzer measurement error, calibration drift, and system bias require the use of calibration gas prepared according to this protocol. If a zero gas is used for the low-level gas, it must meet the requirements under the definition for “zero air” in 40 CFR 72.2. Alternatively, if the “protocol” gas is not commercially available, you must use a reference gas that has been prepared according to the procedures in appendix B of this PS.
3.14
Relative accuracy (RA)
means the absolute mean difference between the gas concentration, or the emission rate determined by the CEMS, and the value determined by the RM, plus the confidence coefficient of a series of nine test runs, divided by the average of the RM or the applicable emission standard.
3.15
Response time (RT)
means the time it takes for the measurement system, while operating normally at its target sample flow rate, dilution ratio, or data collection rate to respond to a known step change in gas concentration, either from a low- or zero-level to a high-level gas concentration or from a high-level to a low or zero-level gas concentration, and to read 95 percent of the change to the stable instrument response. There may be several RTs for an instrument related to different functions or procedures (
e.g.,
DS, LOD, and ME).
3.16
Span value
means an EtO concentration approximately equal to two times the concentration equivalent to the emission standard unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation, permit or another requirement. Unless otherwise specified, the span may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5.
3.17
Stable value
means the measure of two or more values that are statistically the same and the absence of measurement system drift.
3.18
Standard addition
means the addition of known amounts of EtO gas (either statically or dynamically) measured sample gas stream.
3.19
Zero gas
means a gas with an EtO concentration that is below the LOD of the measurement system.

# 4.0 Interferences
Sample gas interferences will vary depending on the instrument or technology used to make the measurement. Interferences must be evaluated through the interference test in this PS. Several compounds including carbon dioxide (CO
2
), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH
4
), and water (H
2
O) are potential optical interferences with certain types of EtO monitoring technology.
Note:
Interferences may be mitigated though the use of dilution systems, however this approach could also affect the sensitivity of the measurement.

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this PS may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This PS may not address all the safety issues associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and as well as cautions within and materials recommended by the RM should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken in regard to the relative accuracy testing.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
The equipment and supplies are the same as in section 6 of PS 18, except replace HCl for EtO where appropriate. The following definitions are added and/or revised:
6.1 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured EtO emissions for moisture is required, you must install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: Any optical measurement system validated according to Method 301 or section 13.0 of Method 320 in appendix A to part 63 of this chapter; a continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring O
2
both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; or other continuous moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Reference Gases means the gas mixture containing EtO at a known concentration and produced and certified in accordance with “EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Standards, May 2012 (EPA 600/R-12/531) or more recent updates. The tests for analyzer measurement error, calibration drift, and system bias require the use of calibration gas prepared according to this protocol. If a zero gas is used for the low-level gas, it must meet the requirements under the definition for “zero air” in 40 CFR 72.2. Alternatively, if the “protocol” gas is not commercially available, you must use a reference gas that has been prepared according to the procedures in appendix B of this PS and meeting the requirements in section 12.2 of appendix B of this PS, if applicable.
7.2 Cylinder gas may be diluted for use in this specification, including measurement error testing. You must document the quantitative introduction of EtO standards into the system using Method 205, found in 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, or other procedure approved by the Administrator. The laboratory/field evaluations in Method 205 must be conducted at least quarterly and prior to any audit test (
e.g.,
CGA, RAA) required in QA Procedure 7 (40 CFR part 60, appendix F). Calibration must be conducted on an annual basis or whenever significant changes are made to the dilution system. In addition to the requirements in Method 205, when in use, you must document gas flow rates through each of the channels; if the dilution system records these values electronically, this is considered the documentation. For the purpose of this PS, cylinder gas should not be diluted beyond a dilution ratio of 500:1 using Method 205.

# 8.0 CEMS Measurement Location Specifications and Pretest Preparation
8.1 Prior to the start of your initial PS tests, you must ensure that the CEMS is installed according to the manufacturer's specifications and the requirements in this section.
8.2 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location where the pollutant concentration or emission rate measurements are directly representative of the EtO emissions. If the units of the emission standard are expressed as a mass (
e.g.,
lb/hr), then the CEMS probe must also be located within 0.5 equivalent diameters of the flow sensor and the CEMS must be located (1) at least
two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur and (2) at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. If the CEMS are to utilize time-sharing, the distance between each measurement point and the CEMS should be approximately the same. The CEMS need not be installed at the same location as the relative accuracy test location. If you fail the RA requirements in this specification due to the CEMS measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated.
8.2.1 Single point sample gas extraction should be (1) no less than 1.0 m (3.3 ft.) from the stack or duct wall or (2) within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.
8.2.2 CEMS and Data Recorder Scale Check. After CEMS installation, record and document the measurement range of the EtO CEMS. The CEMS operating range and the range of the data recording device must encompass all potential and expected EtO concentrations, including the concentration equivalent to the applicable emission limit and the span value.

# 11.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure
After completing the CEMS installation, setup, and calibration, you must complete the PS test procedures in this section. You must perform the following procedures and meet the performance requirements for the initial demonstration of your CEMS:
a. Interference Test;
b. Level of Detection Determination;
c. Response Time Test;
d. Measurement Error Test;
e. Calibration Drift Test; and
f. Relative Accuracy Test.
g. If CEMS is to be time-shared, determine the response time to each measurement point, the sampling time at each measurement point, and the cycle time at each measurement point. The sampling time at each measurement point shall be at least 3 times as long as the system response time (RT), and the maximum number of measurement points shall not exceed the quotient, rounded down to the next whole number, of 15 minutes divided by the longest cycle time of the measurement point.
11.1
Interference Test
11.1.1 Prior to its initial use in the field, you must demonstrate that your monitoring system meets the performance requirements of the interference test in section 13.5 of this PS to verify that the candidate system measures EtO accurately in the presence of common interferences in emission matrices from commercial sterilizers. In the event this performance specification is applied in other emission sources, the interference test must evaluate any other predominant gases is the emission matrices of those sources.
11.1.2 Your interference test must be conducted in a controlled environment. The equipment you test for interference must include the combination of the analyzer, related analysis software, and any sample conditioning equipment (
e.g.,
dilution module, moisture removal equipment or other interferent scrubber) used to control interferents.
11.1.3 If you own multiple measurement systems with components of the same make and model numbers, you need only perform this interference test on one analyzer and associated interference conditioning equipment combination. You may also rely on an interference test conducted by the manufacturer or a continuous measurement system integrator on a system having components of the same make(s) and model(s) of the system that you use.
11.1.4 Perform the interference check using an EtO reference gas concentration of approximately ten times the LOD or at 50 parts per billion, whichever is greater.
11.1.5 Introduce the interference test gases listed in table 1 in section 17.0 of this PS to the analyzer/conditioning system separately or in any combination. The interference test gases need not be of reference gas quality.
11.1.6 The interference test must be performed by combining an EtO reference gas with each interference test gas (or gas mixture). You must measure the baseline EtO response, followed by the response after adding the interference test gas(es) while maintaining a constant EtO concentration. You must perform each interference gas injection and evaluation in triplicate.
Note:
The baseline EtO gas may include interference gases at concentrations typical of ambient air (
e.g.,
21 percent O
2,
400 parts per million (ppm) CO
2
, 2 percent H
2
O), but these concentrations must be brought to the concentrations listed in table 1 of this PS when their interference effects are being evaluated.
11.1.7 You should document the gas volume/rate, temperature, and pressure used to conduct the interference test. A gas blending system or manifold may be used.
11.1.8 Ensure the duration of each interference test is sufficient to condition the EtO measurement system surfaces before a stable measurement is obtained.
11.1.9 Measure the EtO response of the analyzer/sample conditioning system combination to the test gases in ppbv. Record the responses and determine the overall interference response using table 2 in section 17.0 of this PS.
11.1.10 For each interference gas (or mixture), calculate the mean difference (ΔMC
avg
) between the measurement system responses with and without the interference test gas(es) using equation 1 in section 12.2 of this PS. Summarize the results following the format contained in table 2 in section 17.
11.1.11 Calculate the percent interference (I) for the gas runs using equation 2 in section 12.2 of this PS.
11.1.12 The total interference response (
i.e.,
the sum of the interference responses of all tested gaseous components) must not exceed the criteria set forth in section 13.5 of this PS.
11.2 Level of Detection Determination
11.2.1 You must determine the minimum amount of EtO that can be detected above the background in a representative gas matrix.
11.2.2 You must perform the LOD determination in a controlled environment such as a laboratory or manufacturer's facility.
11.2.3 You must add interference gases listed in table 1 of this PS to a constant concentration of EtO reference gas.
11.2.3.1 You may not use an effective reference EtO gas concentration greater than ten times the estimated instrument LOD.
11.2.3.2 Inject the EtO and interferents described in section 11.1.5 of this PS directly into the inlet to the analyzer, allow time for the value to stabilize and then collect measurement data for 15 minutes and average those results. Repeat this procedure to obtain a total of seven or more of these runs, purging the measurement system with ambient air between each run, to determine the LOD.
11.2.4 Calculate the standard deviation of the measured values and define the LOD as three times the standard deviation of these measurements.
11.2.5 You must verify the controlled environment LOD of section 11.2.2 of this PS for your CEMS during initial setup and field certification testing using the SA procedure in appendix A of this PS with the following exceptions:
11.2.5.1 You must make three independent SA measurements spiking the native source concentration by no more than five times the controlled environment LOD concentration determined in section 11.2.4.
11.2.5.2 You must perform the SA as a dynamic spike by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitoring system components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical.
11.2.5.3 The amount detected, or standard addition response (SAR), is based on the average difference of the native EtO concentration in the stack or duct relative to the native stack concentration plus the SA. You must be able to detect the effective spike addition (ESA) above the native EtO present in the stack gas matrix. The ESA is calculated using equation A7 in appendix A of this PS.
11.2.5.4 If the field verification of your system LOD does not demonstrate a SAR greater than or equal to your initial controlled environment LOD, you must increase the SA concentration incrementally and repeat the field verification procedure until the SAR is equal to or greater than LOD. The site-specific standard addition detection level (SADL) is equal to the standard addition needed to achieve the acceptable SAR, and the SADL replaces the controlled environment LOD. The SADL is calculated as the ESA using equation A7 in appendix A of this PS. As described in section 13.1 of this PS, the controlled environment LOD or the SADL that replaces a controlled environment LOD must be less than 20 percent of the applicable emission limit.
11.3 Response Time Determination. You must determine ME- and SA-RT.
11.3.1 For ME-RT, start the upscale RT determination by injecting zero gas into the measurement system as required by the procedures in section 11.4 of this PS. For the SA-RT start the upscale RT determination at native stack concentration of EtO. Allow the value to stabilize, which for the purpose of this PS is a change no change greater than 1.0 percent of span or 10 ppbv (whichever is greater) for 30 seconds.
11.3.2 When the CEMS output has stabilized, record the response in ppbv, record the time (hh:mm:ss), and immediately introduce an upscale (high level) or spike reference gas as required by the relevant (ME-RT or SA-RT) procedure. Record the time (hh:mm:ss) required for the measurement system to reach 95 percent of the change to the final stable value, the difference in these times is the upscale RT.
11.3.3 Reintroduce the zero gas for the ME-RT or stop the upscale gas flow for the SA-RT and immediately record the time (hh:mm:ss). Record the time (hh:mm:ss) required to reach within 95 percent of the previous stable response in 11.3.1 or 10 ppbv (whichever is greater); the difference in these times is the downscale RT.
Note:
For CEMS that perform a series of operations (purge, blow back, sample integration, analyze, etc.), you must start adding reference or zero gas immediately after these procedures are complete.)
11.3.4 Repeat the entire procedure until you have three sets of data, then determine the mean upscale and mean downscale RTs for each relevant procedure (from each measurement point if the CEMS is time-sharing).
Report the greater of the average upscale or average downscale RTs as the RT for the system.
11.4 Measurement Error (ME) Test
11.4.1 The measurement error test must be performed at the same time as the calibration drift test when the system is being placed in service. The measurement error test must be performed any time a substantive change (see section 1.2.5) has been made to the measurement system.
11.4.1.1 Introduce reference gases to the CEMS probe, prior to the sample conditioning and filtration system. You may use a gas dilution system meeting the requirement in section 7.2 of this PS.
11.4.1.2 Challenge the measurement system with a zero gas and at the three upscale EtO reference gas concentrations in the range shown in table 3 of this PS. You may introduce different reference gas concentrations in any order, but you must not introduce the same gas concentration twice in succession.
11.4.1.3 Introduce the calibration gas into the sampling probe with sufficient flow rate to replace the entire source gas sample and continue the gas flow until the response is stable, as evidenced when the difference between two consecutive measurements is within 1.0 percent of span or 5 ppbv (whichever is less). Record this value and inject the next calibration gas.
11.4.1.4 Make triplicate measurements for each reference gas for a total of twelve measurements.
11.4.1.5 At each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses (MC
l
). Calculate the ME using equation 3A in section 12.3.
11.4.1.6 For non-dilution systems, you may adjust the system to maintain the correct flow rate at the analyzer during the test, but you may not make adjustments for any other purpose. For dilution systems, you must operate the measurement system at the appropriate dilution ratio during all system ME checks, and you may make only the adjustments necessary to maintain the proper ratio.
11.4.2 You may use table 5 in section 17.0 to record and report your ME test results.
11.4.3 If the ME specification in section 13.3 is not met for all four reference gas concentrations, take corrective action, and repeat the test until an acceptable 4-level ME test is achieved.
11.5 Seven-Day Calibration Drift (CD) Test
11.5.1 The CD Test Period. Prior to the start of the RA tests, you must perform a seven-day CD test. The purpose of the seven-day CD test is to verify the ability of the CEMS to maintain calibration for each of seven consecutive unit operating days as specified in section 11.5.5 of this PS.
11.5.2 The CD tests must be performed using the zero gas and high-level reference gas standards as defined in table 3 of this PS.
11.5.3 Conduct the CD test on each day during continuous operation of the CEMS and normal facility operations following the procedures in section 11.7 of this PS, except that the zero gas and high-level gas need only be introduced to the measurement system once each for the seven days.
11.5.4 If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and upscale response factor settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments.
Note:
Automatic signal or mathematical processing of all measurement data to determine emission results may be performed throughout the entire CD process.
11.5.5 Determine the magnitude of the CD at approximately 24-hour intervals, for 7 consecutive unit operating days. The 7 consecutive unit operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days.
11.5.6 Record the CEMS response for single measurements of zero gas and high-level reference gas. You may use table 6 in section 17 of this PS to record and report the results of your 7-day CD test. Calculate the CD using equation 3B in section 12.3. Report the absolute value of the differences as a percentage of the span value.
11.5.7 The zero-level and high-level CD for each day must be less than 5.0 percent of the span value or an absolute difference of 10 ppbv, as specified in section 13.2 of this PS. You must meet this criterion for 7 consecutive operating days.
11.5.8 Dynamic Spiking Option for Seven-Day CD Test. You have the option to conduct a high-level dynamic spiking procedure for each of the 7 days in lieu of the high-level reference gas injection described in sections 11.5.2 and 11.5.3. If this option is selected, the daily zero CD check is still required.
11.5.8.1 To conduct each of the seven daily mid-level dynamic spikes, you must use the DS procedure described in appendix A of this PS using a single spike chosen to yield the range as indicated in table 3.
11.5.8.2 You must perform the dynamic spike procedure by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitoring system components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical.
11.5.8.3 Calculate the high-level CD as a percent of span using equation A6 of appendix A to this PS and calculate the zero-drift using equation 3B in section 12.3. Record and report the results as described in sections 11.5.6 and 11.5.7.
11.6 Relative Accuracy Test
11.6.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation, use Method 320 as the RM for EtO measurement. Conduct the RM
tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source that can be compared to the CEMS data. You must collect gas samples that are at stack conditions (hot and wet), and you must traverse the stack or duct as required in section 11.6.3.
11.6.2 Conduct the diluent (if applicable), moisture (if needed), and pollutant measurements simultaneously. If the emission standard is expressed in a mass unit (
i.e.,
lb/hr) you must also determine the flowrate simultaneously with each test using Method 2, 2A, 2B, 2C or 2D in appendix A-1 to this part, as applicable.
11.6.3 Reference Method Measurement Location and Traverse Point(s) Selection.
11.6.3.1 Measurement Location. Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement location at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur, and at least one-half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or a control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (
e.g.,
air heater leakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at the same location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. The CEMS and RM sampling locations need not be the same.
11.6.3.2 Traverse Point Selection. Select traverse points that assure acquisition of representative RM samples over the stack or duct cross section according to one of the following options: (a) sample at twelve traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part or (b) sample at the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. Alternatively, you may conduct a stratification test following the procedures in sections 11.6.3.2.1 through 11.6.3.2.4 to justify sampling at a single point. Stratification testing must be conducted at the sampling location to be used for the RM measurements during the RA test and must be made during normal facility operating conditions. You must evaluate the stratification by measuring the gas on the same moisture basis as the EtO CEMS (wet or dry). Stratification testing must be repeated for each RA test program to justify single point.
11.6.3.2.1 Use a probe of appropriate length to measure the EtO concentration, as described in this section, using 12 traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part for a circular stack or nine points at the centroids of similarly shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section of a rectangular stack.
11.6.3.2.2 Calculate the mean measured concentration for all sampling points (MN
avg
).
11.6.3.2.3 Calculate the percent stratification (S
t
) of each traverse point using equation 5 in section 12.5.
11.6.3.2.4 The gas stream is considered to be unstratified and you may perform the RA testing at a single point that most closely matches the mean if the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean measured concentration for all traverse points by no more than 5.0 percent of the mean concentration of EtO or 10 ppbv, whichever is less restrictive.
11.6.4 In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, record the beginning and end of each RM run (including the time of day in hours, minutes, and seconds) using a clock synchronized with the CEMS clock used to create a permanent time record with the CEMS output.
11.6.5 You must conduct the RA test during representative process and control operating conditions or as specified in an applicable regulation, permit or subpart.
11.6.6 Conduct a minimum of nine RM test runs.
Note:
More than nine RM test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, up to three test run results may be excluded so long as the total number of test run results used to determine the CEMS RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported including the excluded test runs.
11.6.7 Analyze the results from the RM test runs using equations 9 through14 in section 12.6. Calculate the RA between the CEMS results and the RM results.
11.7 Record Keeping and Reporting
11.7.1 Record the results of the CD test, the RT test, the ME test, and the RA test. Also keep records of the RM and CEMS field data, calculations, and reference gas certifications necessary to confirm that the performance of the CEMS met the performance specifications.
11.7.2 For systems that use Method 205 to prepare EtO reference gas standards, record results of Method 205 performance test field evaluation, reference gas certifications, and gas dilution system calibration.
11.7.3 Record the LOD and field verified SADL for the CEMS in ppbv.
11.7.4 Record the results of the interference test.
11.7.5 Report the results of all certification tests to the appropriate regulatory agency (or agencies), in hardcopy and/or electronic format, as required by the applicable regulation or permit.

# PS-19 Appendix A Standard Addition Procedures

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This appendix A (appendix PS-19A) to Performance Specification 19 (PS-19) describes the procedure and performance requirements for standard addition (SA) as a quality check for ethylene oxide (EtO) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS).
1.2 This procedure must be used, as a level of detection (LOD) verification of all field-installed CEMS. Additionally, it is allowed by Procedure 7 in appendix F to this part as an alternative to upscale calibration drift (CD) tests, cylinder gas audits and relative accuracy audits (RAAs), and may be used for quality assurance purposes under other applicable regulations or permits that require EtO monitoring.

# 2.0 Summary of the Appendix for Standard Addition
As used here, SA is a gas phase method of standard additions (either static or dynamic) used to verify the accuracy of CEMS measurements in the presence of the sample matrix. For extractive CEMS, it consists of spiking a known quantity of EtO dynamically into the measurement system as an addition to the native EtO and the native source gas matrix.

# 3.0 Definitions
(See PS-19 and Procedure 7 of appendix F to this part for the Definitions Used in this appendix.)

# 4.0 Interferences
Interferences are discussed in PS-19, section 4.0.

# 5.0 Safety
The procedures required under this appendix may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This procedure may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. You as the facility or operator must establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. As the CEMS user, you should consult instrument operation manuals, material safety data sheets, compressed gas safety requirements, and other Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations for specific precautions to be taken.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
An example of equipment and supplies is described in section 6 of PS-18.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
SA materials must meet the requirements defined for reference gases in section 7 of PS-19 to perform this procedure.

# 8.0 Standard Addition and Dynamic Spiking Procedure
The standard addition procedure consists of measuring the native source gas concentration, addition of reference gas, and measurement of the resulting SA elevated source gas concentration. EtO is spiked dynamically and thus, one must account for the dilution of sample gas from the addition of the EtO reference gas.
8.1 SA Concentration and Measurement Replicates.
8.1.1 You must inject EtO gas to create a measured concentration based on the requirements of the particular performance test (
e.g.,
LOD verification, CD).
8.1.2 Each dynamic spike (DS) or standard addition (SA) replicate consists of a measurement of the source emissions concentration of EtO (native stack concentration) with and without the addition of EtO. With a single CEMS, you must alternate the measurement of the native and SA-elevated source gas so that each measurement of SA-elevated source gas is immediately preceded and followed by a measurement of native stack gas. Introduce the SA gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Alternatively, you may use an independent continuous EtO monitor to measure the native source concentration before and after each standard addition as described in section 8.1.4.
8.1.3 Unless specified otherwise by an applicable rule, your SA-elevated concentration may not exceed 100 percent of span when the SA and native EtO concentration are combined.
8.1.4 As an alternative to making background measurements pre- and post-SA, you may use an independent continuous EtO monitor as a temporary unit to measure native stack EtO concentration while simultaneously using the CEMS to measure the SA-elevated source concentration. If you use an independent continuous EtO monitor you must make one concurrent background or native EtO measurement using both the installed CEMS and the independent continuous EtO monitor, immediately before the SA procedure in section 8.2 or 8.3 begins, to confirm that the independent monitoring system measures the same background concentration as the CEMS being qualified with this PS.
8.2 Dynamic Spiking Procedure.
8.2.1 Your EtO spike addition must not alter the total volumetric sample system flow rate or basic dilution ratio of your CEMS (if applicable).
8.2.2 Your spike gas flow rate must not contribute more than 10 percent of the total volumetric flow rate through the CEMS.
8.2.3 You must determine a dilution factor (DF) or relative concentration of EtO for each dynamic spike. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters accurate to within 2.0 percent or highly accurate tracer gas measurements are required to make the necessary DF determinations at the accuracy required for this PS. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters (
e.g.,
venturi, orifice) accurate to within 2.0 percent should be recertified against an NIST-traceable flow meter annually. Note: Since the spiking mass balance calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the DF determination, the accuracy of measurements required to determine the total volumetric gas flow rate, spike gas flow rate, or tracer gas standard addition concentration is critical to your ability to accurately perform the DS procedure and calculate the results.
8.2.4 You must monitor and record the total sampling system flow rate and sample dilution factor (DF) for the spiking and stack gas sampling systems to ensure they are known and do not change during the spiking procedure. Record all data on a data sheet similar to table A1 in section 13 of this appendix.
8.2.4.1 You may either measure the spike gas flow and the total flow with calibrated flow meters capable of NIST traceable accuracy to ±2.0 percent or calculate the flow using a stable tracer gas included in your spike gas standard.
8.2.4.2 If you use flow measurements to determine the spike dilution, then use equation A1 in section 11.2.1 of this appendix PS-19A to calculate the DF. Determination of the spike dilution requires measurement of EtO spike flow (Q
spike
) and total flow through the CEM sampling system (Q
probe
).
8.2.4.3 If your CEMS is capable of measuring an independent stable tracer gas, you may use a spike gas that includes the tracer to determine the DF using equation A2 or A3 (sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3 of this appendix PS-19A) depending on whether the tracer gas is also present in the native source emissions.
8.2.4.4 For extractive CEMS, you must correct the background measurements of EtO for the dilution caused by the addition of the spike gas standard. For spiking systems that alternate between addition of EtO and zero gas at a constant DF, the background measurements between spikes will not be equal to the native source concentration.
8.2.5 Begin by collecting unspiked sample measurements of EtO. You must use the average of two unspiked sample measurements as your pre-spike background.
Note: Measurements should agree within 5.0 percent or three times the level of detection to avoid biasing the spike results.
8.2.5.1 Introduce the EtO gas spike into the permanent CEMS probe, upstream of the particulate filter or sample conditioning system and as close to the sampling inlet as practical.
8.2.5.2 Maintain the EtO gas spike for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native plus spiked EtO concentration.
8.2.5.3 Stop the flow of spike gas for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native EtO concentration.
8.2.6 Repeat the collection of sample measurements in section 8.2.5 until you have data for each spike concentration including a final set of unspiked sample measurements according to section 8.2.5.3.
8.2.7 Verify that the CEMS responded as expected for each spike gas injection, and that the data quality is not impacted by large shifts in the native source concentration. Discard and repeat any spike injections as necessary to generate a complete set of the required replicate spike measurements.
8.2.8 Calculate the standard addition response (SAR) for extractive CEMS, using equation A4 in section 11.2, of this appendix PS-19A.
8.2.9 If the DS results do not meet the specifications for the appropriate performance test in PS-19 or Procedure 7 of appendix F of this part, you must take corrective action and repeat the DS procedure.

# PS-19 Appendix B Preparation and Certification of Ethylene Oxide Gas Standards

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This appendix (appendix PS-19B) to Performance Specification 19 (PS-19) describes the procedure and performance criteria for the preparation and certification of EtO Gas Manufacturer Primary Standards (GMPS) and Gas Manufacturer Alternative Certified Standards (GMACS). These procedures are not specific to ethylene oxide and could be transferable to the preparation of gas standards for other pollutants regulated under 40 CFR parts 59, 60, 61, 63, and 65.

# 2.0 Summary of the Appendix
EPA requires the use of EPA Protocol gas standards for emissions monitoring. These gases are established following the EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Standards, May 2012 (EPA 600/R-12/531) otherwise referred in this appendix PS-19B as the EPA Traceability Protocol. The EPA Traceability Protocol requires the use of certified reference gas standards directly traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other recognized national metrology institute (NMI) reference gas standards. A NIST certified value is a value for which NIST has the highest confidence in that all known or suspected sources of bias and imprecision have been accounted for. Without NIST or other NMI reference gas standards, the necessary EPA Protocol gas standards cannot be prepared. An alternative approach is needed to establish a gas standard functionally equivalent to the EPA Protocol gas standard when NIST or NMI reference gas standard are not available. This appendix PS-19B is intended to provide procedures and performance criteria for the establishment of Gas Manufacturer Alternative Certified Standards (GMACS), the functional equivalent of EPA Protocol gas standards. GMACS and Gas Manufacturer Primary Standards (GMPS), the functional equivalent of the NIST or NMI reference gas standards. The GMPS are the reference gases used to establish the certified concentrations of the GMACs. The GMPS are established using a dual certification approach where the gravimetrically prepared reference value is confirmed using an independent measurement approach traceable to the International System of Units (SI) and references materials or devices.
2.1 This appendix PS-19B is intended to be performance-based and allow specialty gas manufacturers (SGM) flexibility in the preparation and certification of GMPS and GMACS.
2.2 This appendix PS-19B is not intended to be a replacement for the EPA Protocol gases established according to the EPA Traceability Protocol when calibration gases that meet EPA Traceability Protocol requirements are available.

The exact procedures used will depend on the gas manufacturer and the physical characteristics of the compound being prepared as a gaseous calibration standard. Any procedure is deemed appropriate so long as the criteria in section 8.1 for GMPS and section 8.2 for GMACS are met.
8.1
Preparation and Certification of the GMPS.
The GMPS certified value is established using the dual certification approach. A candidate GMPS cylinder is prepared gravimetrically, and its established reference value is confirmed by an independent measurement traceable to SI units as well as other appropriate reference materials. The level of agreement between the gravimetric reference value and the SI-based independent measurements along with the average value and associated, combined, expanded uncertainties serve to establish the certified reference value. If high purity reference material is not readily available for a gravimetric
preparation, a user may petition the Administrator for an alternative method for preparation of a GMPS.
The procedures for the gravimetric preparation, stability evaluation, and independent verification of GMPS must meet the criteria in this section following the procedures in 8.1
(a)
through
(g).
(a) Raw Materials
(b) GMPS Cylinder Preparation/Creation
(c) GMPS Cylinder Independent Verification
(d) GMPS Cylinder Certification
(e) GMPS Cylinder Stability
(f) GMPS Cylinder Expiration Period
(g) GMPS Documentation
8.1.1 Raw Materials. Raw materials used in the production of GMPS must be of high quality (
e.g.,
99+% purity recommended). Additionally, because raw material purity is the largest component of uncertainty in gas gravimetry, SGMs must substantiate the purity of the raw material prior to use, either via (1) a validated certificate of analysis for the actual lot number purchased provided by the raw material vendor, or (2) a purity assay conducted by the SGM on the actual raw material to be used. The uncertainty of the raw material (U
r
) assay must be included as one of the components of the total combined uncertainty for the mixture.
8.1.2 GMPS Gravimetric Cylinder Preparation/Creation. The GMPS standards shall be based on a gravimetric preparation. The gravimetric preparation shall yield an expected concentration for the target component, and with the required statistical controls in place to calculate the uncertainty of that concentration.
8.1.2.1 The scale used to generate the gravimetric reference standard must be independently calibrated over the range of target masses with ASTM E617-13 Class-1 weights on no less than a yearly basis. For such certifications, a high accuracy mass comparator (electronic or pendulum-type scale) is employed as the “scale.” The resolution of the scale should be sufficient to be able to calculate the overall uncertainty of any concentration derived from these steps.
8.1.2.1.1 The scale used for the gravimetric operation must be independently calibrated and traceable to NIST standards with a defined uncertainty (u
t
).
8.1.2.1.2 The scale calibration must be checked before the start of each new weighing operation (
i.e.,
the day of) with a weight in the appropriate range that also meets ASTM E617-13 Class-1 requirements.
8.1.2.1.3 All material and equipment associated with the gravimetric analysis shall have or apply a procedure to estimate the uncertainty of the measurement, including but not limited to the balance(s) used (u
ca
) standard weight (u
w
).
8.1.2.1.4 The assay purity and associated material uncertainty (u
r
) of the assay for each component raw material and the balance gas must be known. This purity deviation is factored into the uncertainty of the mass of each material blended into the mixture.
8.1.2.1.5 The procedures below are minimum requirements and do not speak to all of the details an SRM would do to ensure the preparation of a high-accuracy gravimetric candidate GMPS, (
e.g.,
controls for external factors that would influence scale reading accuracy buoyancy effects, moisture/dust adsorption on the cylinder surface, and errors caused by the location of the cylinder on the scale). The SGM should develop and follow and internal standard operation procedures (SOP) for the preparation of the candidate GMPS.
8.1.2.1.6 Record the Target cylinder identification number, blend date, and balance gas on the appropriate form (see figure B-1). Additionally, record the intended component(s) to be used in the preparation for this candidate GMPS, identifying the standard type, material name (
e.g.,
Ethylene Oxide), MW (g/mol), and purity (wt%).
8.1.2.1.7 Add the components to the candidate GMPS, recording the weight of each component added.
8.1.2.1.8 GMPS Gravimetric Uncertainty. Calculate and document the gravimetric concentration (GMPS-C
g
) for each component of the candidate GMPS. You must also document the combined uncertainty, expressed as the root sum of the uncertainty budget items identified, for the candidate GMPS value (GMPS-C
gu
). Gravimetric preparation uncertainty budget items include:
(a) The purity of the raw material and the balance gas;
(b) The measured accuracy of the (electronic) balance including consideration the uncertainty of the calibration weights, the calibration uncertainty, and its linearity;
(c) The repeatability of the balance readings including errors caused by the location of the cylinder on the balance;
(d) Balance Buoyancy effects;
(e) Effects of moisture adsorption and dust on the outer surface of the cylinder;
(f) Cylinder dilutions, if any, used to prepare target concentrations, including propagated uncertainties.
8.1.3
GMPS Independent Verification.
The certification of the candidate GMPS is based on independent measurements verifying the reference concentration of the gravimetrically prepared GMPS candidate. The independent verification must be based on a measurement approach traceable to the SI and may include the use of intrinsic NIST or accepted NMI reference materials to establish said traceability. Candidate independent verification measurement approaches include classical chemistry, spectroscopic approaches, as well as other instrumental approaches as long as adequate and appropriate
SI traceability can be incorporated. The approach must be performed using NIST (or equivalent) traceable calibrations materials and using procedures that would allow the user to determine the overall uncertainty of the measurement. In some instances, a component may not be suitable to analysis using a classical approach, in those instances alternative approaches may be used do long as they (1) yield a concentration for the target com, (2) have a calculated uncertainty, (3) have traceability to the SI, and (4) documented conformity to the general metrological principles for primary methods outlined above.
8.1.3.1
GMPS Independent Verification Measurement Uncertainty.
The cumulative uncertainty of the GMPS independent verification measurement approach is integral to the ability to assess the overall quality of the independent verification measurement. You must also document the combined uncertainty, expressed as the root sum of the uncertainty budget items identified. Ensure that all known or suspected sources of bias and imprecision have been accounted for. The following elements are examples of sources of measurement error that must be included in the overall uncertainty calculation for the GMPS independent verification measurement:
(a) The uncertainty of the certified reference solution (the traceability source);
(b) Any propagated uncertainties through serial dilutions;
(c) The errors in volumetric sampling of the candidate GMPS mixture;
(d) The uncertainty of the instrument calibration curve (least squares fit and residual);
(e) The bias or error associated with any measurement interferences;
(f) The repeatability of replicate aliquot injections from the same sample;
(g) The repeatability of replicate samples of the mixture;
(h) Any external factors influencing sampling or instrument accuracy;
(i) The uncertainty of measured volumetric gas flows;
(j) The bias or uncertainty associated with quantitative gas flow delivery;
(k) The error associated with instrumental measurement analyzers;
(l) Replicate measurement instrument error and precision.
8.1.4 GMPS Certification. The candidate GMPS certified value is based on three factors:
(a) The relative agreement between the gravimetric reference value and the independent, measured value of the gravimetrically-prepared GMPS candidate;
(b) The combined, expanded uncertainty (k=2) of the gravimetric value and independently measured concentrations values;
(c) The average of the independently measured concentrations values.
8.1.4.1 GMPS Relative Agreement. Calculate the relative agreement according to equation B-1, expressed as Relative Percent Difference (RPD) between the gravimetric concentration (GMPS-C
g
) the independently measured concentrations (GMPS-C
a
). The results of these two analyses must agree within 4.0 percent (%).
ER05AP24.020
8.1.4.2 GMPS Combined, Expanded Uncertainty. Determine the individual uncertainties for the gravimetric approach (GMPS-C
ug
) and the independent measurement verification approach (GMPS-C
ua
) according to equation B-2. Establish the GMPS combined, expanded uncertainty (GMPS-C
uc
) as the root sum of the two individual uncertainties with a coverage factor k=2. The combined uncertainty must ≤5.0 percent (%). If these objectives are not met, the candidate GMPS is not acceptable, and must not be used.
ER05AP24.021
8.1.4.3 GMPS Certified Concentration Value. If the GMPS meets the Relative Agreement criteria in section 8.1.5.3 and the combined, expanded uncertainty criteria in section 8.1.5.4, the GMPS is valid. The GMPS certified value (GMPS-C
C
) is based on the
independently measurement concentration (GMPS-C
a
). The certification date is the date of the last confirmatory measurement.
8.1.4.4 An SGMs may propose to Administrator an alternative acceptance values for section 8.1.5.1 or 8.1.5.2 for those components that are unable to meet the documented criteria. These proposals must include sufficient documentation that the objectives are unreasonable for a given component and concentrations.
8.1.5 GMPS Stability Testing. The SGM must test and document mixture stability of the GMPS to assure that the mixture stays within claimed accuracy bounds for the entire claimed expiration period. Alternatively, once a preparation process has been developed, the SGM can perform a stability study consisting not less than three cylinders prepared using the defined process and at the concentration(s) defined by the process. Once the stability study cylinders have demonstrated acceptable stability for the minimum expiration period (6-months), additional GMPS cylinders can be prepared under identical process conditions.
8.1.5.1 The SGM may select the sampling frequency based on the targeted expiration period, the gas consumed in the analysis and expected component behavior. Stability testing data must consist of at least:
(a) Five discrete samplings of the retained mixture for an expiration period of 6-months to 1-year;
(b) Ten discrete samplings for an expiration period of 1-3 years; and
(c) Twenty for any period greater than 3 years.
8.1.5.2 Stability testing must be conducted for each cylinder size/type and at a similar concentration as the candidate GMPS. Stability analyses must be performed using methods that assure consistent results can be achieved. If instrumental analysis using a gas standard is employed, use of a GMPS standard is highly recommended. In the absence of a certified GMPS, stability testing must be conducted using the same independent verification measurement procedures and methodology used in section 8.1.4, or using another known-to-be-stable gas standard containing the target component in a similar concentration range.
8.1.5.3 Stability testing data must not show any upward or downward trends that would cause the mixture to become out of specification prior to the claimed expiration period.
8.1.6 GMPS Expiration Period. The expiration period for the GMPS mixture based must be based on the empirical stability test data. The expiration periods for reactive gases must not exceed the length of the stability test, however for non-reactive gases you may forecast an expiration period not to exceed two times the actual stability testing duration. The maximum expiration period for a GMPS is time span from the date of preparation to the date of the last/most recent stability study may not be less than 6-months. Provided that acceptable stability is observed, the maximum expiration period may be extended by retaining the stability study cylinders and performing additional analyses.
8.1.7 GMPS Documentation. You must document the preparation of the GMPS through the appropriate record keeping and document the certification of a GMPS. The information is section 8.1.8.1 and 8.1.8.2 must be maintained as a record by the SGM for the purpose of maintaining traceability and to verify the preparation. The information in section 8.1.8.3 must be documented and maintained by the SGM. This documentation and the records of the preparation and certification must be made available upon request by the appropriate delegated authority.
8.1.7.1 The following information for the gravimetric preparation information of the GMPS must be documented and maintained as a record. This record should include but is not limited to the: blend date, gravimetric concentration, gravimetric concentration uncertainties as a percentage and absolute, reference material information and purity, scale ID, scale accuracy, and calculated gravimetric uncertainties associated with material, balance, and environmental effects. You must include sufficient information that will allow a 3rd party to recalculate the prepared concentration and expanded uncertainties.
8.1.7.2 The following information for the analytical verification of the GMPS must be recorded and maintained as a record. This record should include the confirming methodology and any associated SOPs, confirming concentration(s), instrumentation used, calibration standards used and associated COAs, calibration curve data, replicate analysis calculated, and expanded uncertainties.
8.1.7.3 The following information must be documented for inclusion on the COA for the GMACS.
(a) Manufacturer's company name and address of the producing location
(b) Manufacturer's part number for the GMPS, lot number, and/or production record.
(c) Cylinder number, cylinder type, cylinder preparation ID, moisture dew point and cylinder pressure.
(d) Certification date and claimed expiration date.
(e) GMPS component(s) name, final certified concentration(s) (GMPS-C
c
), and balance gas.
(f) Gravimetric value and uncertainty
(g)Verification value and uncertainty
(h) GMPS final certified value and uncertainty absolute as a percentage (GMPS-C
u
)
8.2 Preparation and Certification of the GMACS. The preparation and certification of
the candidate GMACS is also based on the independent verification of the gravimetrically prepared reference value. However, the independent verification utilizes the GMPS to perform the independent verification. This is accomplished by following the procedures in section 2.1 and 2.2 of the EPA Traceability Protocol, using the GMPS as the certified reference material. The measured value of the independent verification following the EPA Traceability Protocol procedures also establishes the certified reference value, providing the relative agreement performance criteria are met.
8.2.1 GMACS Gravimetric Cylinder Preparation/Creation. The gravimetric preparation of the GMACS is identical to the procedures used to gravimetrically prepare the GMPS. You must maintain the same information required for the gravimetric preparation of GMPS, as found in section 8.1.8.1 for GMACS, as a record.
8.2.2 GMACS Independent Verification and Certification. The candidate GMACS independent verification of the gravimetrically prepared reference value is contingent on the SGM following the procedures in sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the EPA Traceability Protocol. In addition, the EtO candidate GMACS certified reference value and associated expanded uncertainty is based on the EPA Traceability Protocol measured value. This is contingent upon the gravimetric and measured values meeting the relative agreement performance criteria established in section 8.1.5.3 and the uncertainty criteria established in section 8.1.5.4. Gas Manufacturers Intermediate Standards (GMIS) can be prepared by direct comparison to a GMPS that has been prepared and certified according to section 2.1.3.1 and 2.2 of the EPA Traceability Protocol. The tagged value of the GMACS must be based on the EPA Traceability Protocol measured value as long as the performance criteria in sections 12.1 and 12.2 are met.
8.2.3 GMACS Stability Testing. The SGM must test and document the stability of the GMACS to assure that the mixture stays within claimed certified bounds for the entire claimed expiration period. Use the procedures in section 8.1.6 to assess stability. The GMACS must also meet the requirements in section 2.1.5.2 of the EPA Traceability Protocol.
8.2.4 GMACS Expiration Date. The certification period of the GMACS shall be based on the documented stability tests of the GMPS in section 8.1.6. The expiration date shall be based on the certification date, plus the certification period plus one day. There is not a maximum period of expiration; however, expiration periods must not be less than six months.
8.2.5 GMACS Documentation You must document and maintain the same information required for the analytical verification of the GMPS, as found in section 8.1.8 for GMACS, as a record. The records of the preparation and certification must be made available upon request by the appropriate delegated authority.
8.2.6 GMACS Certificate of Analysis (COA). You must provide comprehensive documentation of the GMPS and GMACS development process in the form of a GMACS Certificate of Analysis (COA) that accompanies each commercially distributed GMACS. As a minimum, the COA must contain the following information:
(a) Identification of the gas as a Gas Manufacturer Alternative Certified Standard;
(b) The cylinder number;
(c) The certified concentration of the GMACS;
(d) The combined expanded uncertainty (k=2) of the GMACS reference value (both absolute and relative);
(e) The expiration date;
(f) The reference materials or standards used (
i.e.,
GMPS and GMIS);
(g) The same information (cylinder number, certified concentration, uncertainties, expiration dates, etc. for these cylinders);
(h) The gravimetric and independent measured verification reference concentration values and associated uncertainties for each GMPS used;
(i) Associated measurement principles and uncertainties;
(j) Any additional information stipulated by the EPA Traceability Protocol;
(k) Any comments/special instructions.
The SGM GMACS provider is encouraged to include additional relevant information to the COA, as appropriate. An example GMACS COA can be found in section 14 of this appendix.

# Appendix C to Part 60—Determination of Emission Rate Change

# 1. Introduction
1.1 The following method shall be used to determine whether a physical or operational change to an existing facility resulted in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere. The method used is the Student's
t
test, commonly used to make inferences from small samples.

n
runs (usually three) which produce
n
emission rates. Thus two sets of emission rates are generated, one before and one after the change, the two sets being of equal size.
2.2 When using manual emission tests, except as provided in § 60.8(b) of this part, the reference methods of appendix A to this part shall be used in accordance with the procedures specified in the applicable subpart both before and after the change to obtain the data.
2.3 When using continuous monitors, the facility shall be operated as if a manual
emission test were being performed. Valid data using the averaging time which would be required if a manual emission test were being conducted shall be used.

# Appendix F to Part 60—Quality Assurance Procedures
Pt. 60, App. F, Proc. 1

# Procedure 1. Quality Assurance Requirements for Gas Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination

# 1. Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. Procedure 1 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by any continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that is used for determining compliance with the emission standards on a continuous basis as specified in the applicable regulation. The CEMS may include pollutant (e.g., S0
2
and N0
x
) and diluent (e.g., 0
2
or C0
2
) monitors.
This procedure specifies the minimum QA requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Source owners and operators responsible for one or more CEMS's used for compliance monitoring must meet these minimum requirements and are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.
Data collected as a result of QA and QC measures required in this procedure are to be submitted to the Agency. These data are to be used by both the Agency and the CEMS operator in assessing the effectiveness of the CEMS QC and QA procedures in the maintenance of acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.
Appendix F, Procedure 1 is applicable December 4, 1987. The first CEMS accuracy assessment shall be a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) (see section 5) and shall be completed by March 4, 1988 or the date of the initial performance test required by the applicable regulation, whichever is later.
1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control loop: When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies the assessment methods for response drift and accuracy. The methods are based on procedures included in the applicable performance specifications (PS's) in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Procedure 1 also requires the analysis of the EPA audit samples concurrent with certain reference method (RM) analyses as specified in the applicable RM's.
Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective and efficient for the circumstances.

# 2. Definitions
2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System. The total equipment required for the determination of a gas concentration or emission rate.
2.2 Diluent Gas. A major gaseous constituent in a gaseous pollutant mixture. For combustion sources, CO
2
and O
2
are the major gaseous constituents of interest.
2.3 Span Value. The upper limit of a gas concentration measurement range that is specified for affected source categories in the applicable subpart of the regulation.
2.4 Zero, Low-Level, and High-Level Values. The CEMS response values related to the source specific span value. Determination of zero, low-level, and high-level values
is defined in the appropriate PS in appendix B of this part.
2.5 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output reading from a reference value after a period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair or adjustment took place. The reference value may be supplied by a cylinder gas, gas cell, or optical filter and need not be certified.
2.6 Relative Accuracy (RA). The absolute mean difference between the gas concentration or emission rate determined by the CEMS and the value determined by the RM's plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests or the applicable emission limit.

# 3. QC Requirements
Each source owner or operator must develop and implement a QC program. As a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities:
1. Calibration of CEMS.
2. CD determination and adjustment of CEMS.
3. Preventive maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory).
4. Data recording, calculations, and reporting.
5. Accuracy audit procedures including sampling and analysis methods.
6. Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.
As described in section 5.2, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the current written procedures or modify or replace the CEMS to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.
These written procedures must be kept on record and available for inspection by the enforcement agency.

# 4. CD Assessment
4.1 CD Requirement. As described in § 60.13(d), source owners and operators of CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two concentration values at least once daily (approximately 24 hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. When using reference gases, introduce the reference gas prior to any sample conditioning or filtration equipment and ensure that it passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling. The reference gas must pass through as much of the sampling probe as practical. The CEMS calibration must, at a minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily zero (or low-level) CD or the daily high-level CD exceeds two times the limits of the applicable PS's in appendix B to this part.
4.2 Recording Requirement for Automatic CD Adjusting Monitors. Monitors that automatically adjust the data to the corrected calibration values (e.g., microprocessor control) must be programmed to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the CD prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or record the amount of adjustment.
4.3 Criteria for Excessive CD. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in appendix B for five, consecutive, daily periods, the CEMS is out-of-control. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds four times the applicable drift specification in appendix B during any CD check, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. Following corrective action, repeat the CD checks.
4.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the fifth, consecutive, daily CD check with a CD in excess of two times the allowable limit, or the time corresponding to the completion of the daily CD check preceding the daily CD check that results in a CD in excess of four times the allowable limit. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the CD check following corrective action that results in the CD's at both the zero (or low-level) and high-level measurement points being within the corresponding allowable CD limit (i.e., either two times or four times the allowable limit in appendix B).
4.3.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)].
4.4 Data Recording and Reporting. As required in § 60.7(d) of this regulation (40 CFR part 60), all measurements from the CEMS must be retained on file by the source owner for at least 2 years. However, emission data obtained on each successive day while the CEMS is out-of-control may not be included as part of the minimum daily data requirement of the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)] nor be used in the calculation of reported emissions for that period.

# 5. Data Accuracy Assessment
5.1 Auditing Requirements. Each CEMS must be audited at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits shall occur no closer than 2 months. The audits shall be conducted as follows:
5.1.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). The RATA must be conducted at
least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in section 5.1.4 of this appendix. Conduct the RATA as described for the RA test procedure in the applicable PS in appendix B (e.g., PS 2 for SO
2
and NO
X
). In addition, analyze the appropriate performance audit samples received from EPA as described in the applicable sampling methods (e.g., Methods 6 and 7).
5.1.2 Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA). If applicable, a CGA may be conducted in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession.
To conduct a CGA: (1) Challenge the CEMS (both pollutant and diluent portions of the CEMS, if applicable) with an audit gas of known concentration at two points within the following ranges:
Audit point
Audit range
Pollutant monitors
Diluent monitors for—
CO
2
O
2
1
20 to 30% of span value
5 to 8% by volume
4 to 6% by volume.
2
50 to 60% of span value
10 to 14% by volume
8 to 12% by volume.
Introduce each of the audit gases, three times each for a total of six challenges. Introduce the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not introduce the same gas concentration twice in succession.
Use of separate audit gas cylinder for audit points 1 and 2. Do not dilute gas from audit cylinder when challenging the CEMS.
The monitor should be challenged at each audit point for a sufficient period of time to assure adsorption-desorption of the CEMS sample transport surfaces has stabilized.
(2) Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode, i.e., pass the audit gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as is practical. At a minimum, the audit gas should be introduced at the connection between the probe and the sample line.
(3) Use Certified Reference Materials (CRM's) (See Citation 1) audit gases that have been certified by comparison to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) or EPA Protocol Gases following the most recent edition of the EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards (See Citation 2). Procedures for preparation of CRM's are described in Citation 1. Procedures for preparation of EPA Protocol Gases are described in Citation 2. In the case that a suitable audit gas level is not commercially available, Method 205 (See Citation 3) may be used to dilute CRM's or EPA Protocol Gases to the needed level. The difference between the actual concentration of the audit gas and the concentration indicated by the monitor is used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS.
5.1.3 Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). The RAA may be conducted three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct a RAA, follow the procedure described in the applicable PS in appendix B for the relative accuracy test, except that only three sets of measurement data are required. Analyses of EPA performance audit samples are also required.
The relative difference between the mean of the RM values and the mean of the CEMS responses will be used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS.
5.1.4 Other Alternative Audits. Other alternative audit procedures may be used as approved by the Administrator for three of four calendar quarters. One RATA is required at least every four calendar quarters, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate) in the fourth calendar quarter since the quarter of the previous RATA. In that case, the RATA shall be performed in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Also, cylinder gas audits are not be required for calendar quarters in which the affected facility does not operate.
5.2 Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the RA, using the RATA, CGA, or RAA exceeds the criteria in section 5.2.3, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the source owner or operator must audit the CEMS with a RATA, CGA, or RAA to determine if the CEMS is operating within the specifications. A RATA must always be used following an out-of-control period resulting from a RATA. The audit following corrective action does not require analysis of EPA performance audit samples. If audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, the CEMS operator shall report both the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.
5.2.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling for the RATA, RAA, or CGA. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent successful audit.
5.2.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the monitor is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availabilty as required and described in the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)].
5.2.3 Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart of this part, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:
(1) For the RATA, the allowable RA in the applicable PS in appendix B to this part.
(2) For the CGA, for pollutant monitors, the audit inaccuracy must be ±15 percent of the average audit value as calculated using equation 1-1 of this method or the difference between the average CEMS response and the average audit value must be less than one of the following:
Analyzer span
Alternative
CGA criteria
(ppm)
≥50 ppm
±5
20 ppm, but ≤50 ppm
±3
≤20 ppm
+2
For diluent monitors, ±15 percent of the average audit value.
(3) For the RAA, ±15 percent of the three-run average or ±7.5 percent of the applicable standard, whichever is greater.
5.3 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedure. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (i.e., out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly audits) indicates the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consective quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the QC procedures (see section 3) or modify or replace the CEMS.

# 6. Calculations for CEMS Data Accuracy
6.1 RATA RA Calculation. Follow the equations described in section 8 of appendix B, PS 2 to calculate the RA for the RATA. The RATA must be calculated in units of the applicable emission standard (e.g., ng/J).
6.2 RAA Accuracy Calculation. Use equation 1-1 of this method to calculate the accuracy for the RAA. The RAA must be calculated in the units of the applicable emission standard.
6.3 CGA Accuracy Calculation. Use Equation 1-1 to calculate the accuracy for the CGA, which is calculated in units of the appropriate concentration (e.g., ppm SO
2
or percent O
2
). Each component of the CEMS must meet the acceptable accuracy requirement.
EC16NO91.240
where:
A = Accuracy of the CEMS, percent.
C
m
= Average CEMS response during audit in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
C
a
= Average audit value (CGA certified value or three-run average for RAA) in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
6.4 Example Accuracy Calculations. Example calculations for the RATA, RAA, and CGA are available in Citation 3.

# 7. Reporting Requirements
At the reporting interval specified in the applicable regulation, report for each CEMS the accuracy results from section 6 and the CD assessment results from section 4. Report the drift and accuracy information as a Data Assessment Report (DAR), and include one copy of this DAR for each quarterly audit with the report of emissions required under the applicable subparts of this part.
As a minimum, the DAR must contain the following information:
1. Source owner or operator name and address.
2. Identification and location of monitors in the CEMS.
3. Manufacturer and model number of each monitor in the CEMS.
4. Assessment of CEMS data accuracy and date of assessment as determined by a RATA, RAA, or CGA described in section 5 including the RA for the RATA, the A for the RAA or CGA, the RM results, the cylinder gases certified values, the CEMS responses, and the calculations results as defined in section 6. If the accuracy audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, the CEMS operator shall report both the audit results showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.
5. Results from EPA performance audit samples described in section 5 and the applicable RM's.
6. Summary of all corrective actions taken when CEMS was determined out-of-control, as described in sections 4 and 5.
An example of a DAR format is shown in Figure 1.

# Procedure 2—Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 What Are the Purpose and Applicability of Procedure 2?
The purpose of Procedure 2 is to establish the minimum requirements for evaluating the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by your particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Procedure 2 applies to PM CEMS used for continuously determining compliance with emission standards or operating permit limits as specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Other QC procedures may apply to diluent (
e.g.,
O
2
) monitors and other auxiliary monitoring equipment included with your CEMS to facilitate PM measurement or determination of PM concentration in units specified in an applicable regulation.
1.1 What measurement parameter does Procedure 2 address? Procedure 2 covers the instrumental measurement of PM as defined by your source's applicable reference method (no Chemical Abstract Service number assigned).
1.2 For what types of devices must I comply with Procedure 2? You must comply with Procedure 2 for the total equipment that:
(1) We require you to install and operate on a continuous basis under the applicable regulation, and
(2) You use to monitor the PM mass concentration associated with the operation of a process or emission control device.
1.3 What are the data quality objectives (DQOs) of Procedure 2? The overall DQO of Procedure 2 is the generation of valid, representative data that can be transferred into useful information for determining PM CEMS concentrations averaged over a prescribed interval. Procedure 2 is also closely associated with Performance Specification 11 (PS-11).
(1) Procedure 2 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of PM CEMS data submitted to us or the delegated permitting authority.
(2) You must meet these minimum requirements if you are responsible for one or more PM CEMS used for compliance monitoring. We encourage you to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.
1.4 What is the intent of the QA/QC procedures specified in Procedure 2? Procedure 2 is intended to establish the minimum QA/QC requirements for PM CEMS and is presented in general terms to allow you to develop a program that is most effective for your circumstances. You may adopt QA/QC procedures that go beyond these minimum requirements to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
1.5 When must I comply with Procedure 2? You must comply with the basic requirements of Procedure 2 immediately following successful completion of the initial correlation test of PS-11.

# 2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of Procedure 2?
Procedure 2 requires you to perform periodic evaluations of PM CEMS performance and to develop and implement QA/QC programs to ensure that PM CEMS data quality is maintained.
2.1 What are the basic functions of Procedure 2?
(1) Assessment of the quality of your PM CEMS data by estimating measurement accuracy;
(2) Control and improvement of the quality of your PM CEMS data by implementing QC requirements and corrective actions until the data quality is acceptable; and
(3) Specification of requirements for daily instrument zero and upscale drift checks and daily sample volume checks, as well as routine response correlation audits, absolute correlation audits, sample volume audits, and relative response audits.

# 3.0 What Special Definitions Apply to Procedure 2?
The definitions in Procedure 2 include those provided in PS-11 of Appendix B, with the following additions:
3.1 “Absolute Correlation Audit (ACA)” means an evaluation of your PM CEMS response to a series of reference standards covering the full measurement range of the instrument (
e.g.,
4 mA to 20 mA).
3.2 “Correlation Range” means the range of PM CEMS responses used in the complete set of correlation test data.
3.3 “PM CEMS Correlation” means the site-specific relationship (
i.e.,
a regression equation) between the output from your PM CEMS (
e.g.,
mA) and the particulate concentration, as determined by the reference method. The PM CEMS correlation is expressed in the same units as the PM concentration measured by your PM CEMS (
e.g.,
mg/acm). You must derive this relation from PM CEMS response data and manual reference method data that were gathered simultaneously. These data must be representative of the full range of source and control device operating conditions that you expect to occur. You must develop the correlation by performing the steps presented in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of PS-11.
3.4 “Reference Method Sampling Location” means the location in your source's exhaust duct from which you collect manual reference method data for developing your PM CEMS correlation and for performing relative response audits (RRAs) and response correlation audits (RCAs).
3.5 “Response Correlation Audit (RCA)” means the series of tests specified in section 10.3(8) of this procedure that you conduct to ensure the continued validity of your PM CEMS correlation.
3.6 “Relative Response Audit (RRA)” means the brief series of tests specified in section 10.3(6) of this procedure that you conduct between consecutive RCAs to ensure the continued validity of your PM CEMS correlation.
3.7 “Sample Volume Audit (SVA)” means an evaluation of your PM CEMS measurement of sample volume if your PM CEMS determines PM concentration based on a measure of PM mass in an extracted sample volume and an independent determination of sample volume.

# 4.0 Interferences
[Reserved]

# 5.0 What Do I Need To Know To Ensure the Safety of Persons Using Procedure 2?
People using Procedure 2 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. Procedure 2 does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing this procedure. You must consult your CEMS user's manual for specific precautions to be taken with regard to your PM CEMS procedures.

# 6.0 What Equipment and Supplies Do I Need?
[Reserved]

# 7.0 What Reagents and Standards Do I Need?
You will need reference standards or procedures to perform the zero drift check, the upscale drift check, and the sample volume check.
7.1 What is the reference standard value for the zero drift check? You must use a zero check value that is no greater than 20 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. You must obtain documentation on the zero check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.
7.2 What is the reference standard value for the upscale drift check? You must use an upscale check value that produces a response between 50 and 100 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. For a PM CEMS that produces output over a range of 4 mA to 20 mA, the upscale check value must produce a response in the range of 12 mA to 20 mA. You must obtain documentation on the upscale check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.
7.3 What is the reference standard value for the sample volume check? You must use a reference standard value or procedure that produces a sample volume value equivalent to the normal sampling rate. You must obtain documentation on the sample volume value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.

# 8.0 What Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport Are Relevant to This Procedure?
[Reserved]

# 9.0 What Quality Control Measures Are Required by This Procedure for My PM CEMS?
You must develop and implement a QC program for your PM CEMS. Your QC program must, at a minimum, include written procedures that describe, in detail, complete step-by-step procedures and operations for the activities in paragraphs (1) through (8) of this section.
(1) Procedures for performing drift checks, including both zero drift and upscale drift and the sample volume check (see sections 10.2(1), (2), and (5)).
(2) Methods for adjustment of PM CEMS based on the results of drift checks, sample volume checks (if applicable), and the periodic audits specified in this procedure.
(3) Preventative maintenance of PM CEMS (including spare parts inventory and sampling probe integrity).
(4) Data recording, calculations, and reporting.
(5) RCA and RRA procedures, including sampling and analysis methods, sampling strategy, and structuring test conditions over the prescribed range of PM concentrations.
(6) Procedures for performing ACAs and SVAs and methods for adjusting your PM CEMS response based on ACA and SVA results.
(7) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning PM CEMS, including flagged data periods.
(8) For extractive PM CEMS, procedures for checking extractive system ducts for material accumulation.
9.1 What QA/QC documentation must I have? You are required to keep the written QA/QC procedures on record and available for inspection by us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency for the life of your CEMS or until you are no longer subject to the requirements of this procedure.
9.2 How do I know if I have acceptable QC procedures for my PM CEMS? Your QC procedures are inadequate or your PM CEMS is incapable of providing quality data if you fail two consecutive QC audits (
i.e.,
out-of-control conditions resulting from the annual audits, quarterly audits, or daily checks). Therefore, if you fail the same two consecutive audits, you must revise your QC procedures or modify or replace your PM CEMS to correct the deficiencies causing the excessive inaccuracies (see section 10.4 for limits for excessive audit inaccuracy).

# 10.0 What Calibration/Correlation and Standardization Procedures Must I Perform for My PM CEMS?
You must generate a site-specific correlation for each of your PM CEMS installation(s) relating response from your PM CEMS to results from simultaneous PM reference method testing. The PS-11 defines procedures for developing the correlation and defines a series of statistical parameters for assessing acceptability of the correlation. However, a critical component of your PM CEMS correlation process is ensuring the accuracy and precision of reference method data. The activities listed in sections 10.1 through 10.10 assure the quality of the correlation.
10.1 When should I use paired trains for reference method testing? Although not required, we recommend that you should use paired-train reference method testing to generate data used to develop your PM CEMS correlation and for RCA testing. Guidance on the use of paired sampling trains can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5 of PS-11).
10.2 What routine system checks must I perform on my PM CEMS? You must perform routine checks to ensure proper operation of system electronics and optics, light and radiation sources and detectors, and electric or electro-mechanical systems. Necessary components of the routine system checks will depend on design details of your PM CEMS. As a minimum, you must verify the system operating parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section on a daily basis. Some PM CEMS may perform one or more of
these functions automatically or as an integral portion of unit operations; for other PM CEMS, you must initiate or perform one or more of these functions manually.
(1) You must check the zero drift to ensure stability of your PM CEMS response to the zero check value. You must determine system output on the most sensitive measurement range when the PM CEMS is challenged with a zero reference standard or procedure. You must, at a minimum, adjust your PM CEMS whenever the daily zero drift exceeds 4 percent.
(2) You must check the upscale drift to ensure stability of your PM CEMS response to the upscale check value. You must determine system output when the PM CEMS is challenged with a reference standard or procedure corresponding to the upscale check value. You must, at a minimum, adjust your PM CEMS whenever the daily upscale drift check exceeds 4 percent.
(3) For light-scattering and extinction-type PM CEMS, you must check the system optics to ensure that system response has not been altered by the condition of optical components, such as fogging of lens and performance of light monitoring devices.
(4) You must record data from your automatic drift-adjusting PM CEMS before any adjustment is made. If your PM CEMS automatically adjusts its response to the corrected calibration values (
e.g.,
microprocessor control), you must program your PM CEMS to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the drift check before resetting the calibration. Alternately, you may program your PM CEMS to record the amount of adjustment.
(5) For extractive PM CEMS that measure the sample volume and use the measured sample volume as part of calculating the output value, you must check the sample volume on a daily basis to verify the accuracy of the sample volume measuring equipment. This sample volume check must be done at the normal sampling rate of your PM CEMS. You must adjust your PM CEMS sample volume measurement whenever the daily sample volume check error exceeds 10 percent.
10.3 What are the auditing requirements for my PM CEMS? You must subject your PM CEMS to an ACA and an SVA, as applicable, at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits must occur no closer than 2 months apart. You must conduct an RCA and an RRA at the frequencies specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit. An RRA or RCA conducted during any calendar quarter can take the place of the ACA required for that calendar quarter. An RCA conducted during the period in which an RRA is required can take the place of the RRA for that period.
(1) When must I perform an ACA? You must perform an ACA each quarter unless you conduct an RRA or RCA during that same quarter.
(2) How do I perform an ACA? You perform an ACA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (2)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) You must challenge your PM CEMS with an audit standard or an equivalent audit reference to reproduce the PM CEMS's measurement at three points within the following ranges:
Audit point
Audit range
1
0 to 20 percent of measurement range
2
40 to 60 percent of measurement range
3
70 to 100 percent of measurement range
(ii) You must then challenge your PM CEMS three times at each audit point and use the average of the three responses in determining accuracy at each audit point. Use a separate audit standard for audit points 1, 2, and 3. Challenge the PM CEMS at each audit point for a sufficient period of time to ensure that your PM CEMS response has stabilized.
(iii) Operate your PM CEMS in the mode, manner, and range specified by the manufacturer.
(iv) Store, maintain, and use audit standards as recommended by the manufacturer.
(v) Use the difference between the actual known value of the audit standard and the response of your PM CEMS to assess the accuracy of your PM CEMS.
(3) When must I perform an SVA? You must perform an audit of the measured sample volume (
e.g.,
the sampling flow rate for a known time) once per quarter for applicable PM CEMS with an extractive sampling system. Also, you must perform and pass an SVA prior to initiation of any of the reference method data collection runs for an RCA or RRA.
(4) How do I perform an SVA? You perform an SVA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) You perform an SVA by independently measuring the volume of sample gas extracted from the stack or duct over each batch cycle or time period with a calibrated device. You may make this measurement either at the inlet or outlet of your PM CEMS, so long as it measures the sample gas volume without including any dilution or recycle air. Compare the measured volume with the volume reported by your PM CEMS for the same cycle or time period to calculate sample volume accuracy.
(ii) You must make measurements during three sampling cycles for batch extractive monitors (
e.g.,
Beta-gauge) or during three periods of at least 20 minutes for continuous extractive PM CEMS.
(iii) You may need to condense, collect, and measure moisture from the sample gas prior to the calibrated measurement device (
e.g.,
dry gas meter) and correct the results for moisture content. In any case, the volumes measured by the calibrated device and your PM CEMS must be on a consistent temperature, pressure, and moisture basis.
(5) How often must I perform an RRA? You must perform an RRA at the frequency specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit. You may conduct an RCA instead of an RRA during the period when the RRA is required.
(6) How do I perform an RRA? You must perform the RRA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) You perform an RRA by collecting three simultaneous reference method PM concentration measurements and PM CEMS measurements at the as-found source operating conditions and PM concentration.
(ii) We recommend that you use paired trains for reference method sampling. Guidance on the use of paired sampling trains can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5 of PS-11).
(7) How often must I perform an RCA? You must perform an RCA at the frequency specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit.
(8) How do I perform an RCA? You must perform the RCA according to the procedures for the PM CEMS correlation test described in PS-11, section 8.6, except that the minimum number of runs required is 12 in the RCA instead of 15 as specified in PS-11.
(9) What other alternative audits can I use? You can use other alternative audit procedures as approved by us, the State, or local agency for the quarters when you would conduct ACAs.
10.4 What are my limits for excessive audit inaccuracy? Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart, the criteria for excessive audit inaccuracy are listed in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section.
(1) What are the criteria for excessive zero or upscale drift? Your PM CEMS is out of control if the zero drift check or upscale drift check either exceeds 4 percent for five consecutive daily periods or exceeds 8 percent for any one day.
(2) What are the criteria for excessive sample volume measurement error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if sample volume check error exceeds 10 percent for five consecutive daily periods or exceeds 20 percent for any one day.
(3) What are the criteria for excessive ACA error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if the results of any ACA exceed ±10 percent of the average audit value, as calculated using Equation 2-1a, or 7.5 percent of the applicable standard, as calculated using Equation 2-1b, whichever is greater.
(4) What is the criterion for excessive SVA error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if results exceed ±5 percent of the average sample volume audit value.
(5) What are the criteria for passing a RCA? To pass a RCA, you must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (5)(i) and (ii) of this section. If your PM CEMS fails to meet these RCA criteria, it is out of control.
(i) For all 12 data points, the PM CEMS response value can be no greater than the greatest PM CEMS response value used to develop your correlation curve.
(ii) At least 75 percent of a minimum number of 12 sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements must fall within a specified area on a graph of the correlation regression line. The specified area on the graph of the correlation regression line is defined by two lines parallel to the correlation regression line, offset at a distance of ±25 percent of the numerical emission limit value from the correlation regression line. If any of the PM CEMS response values resulting from your RCA are lower than the lowest PM CEMS response value of your existing correlation curve, you may extend your correlation regression line to the point corresponding to the lowest PM CEMS response value obtained during the RCA. This extended correlation regression line must then be used to determine if the RCA data meets this criterion.
(6) What are the criteria to pass a RRA? To pass a RRA, you must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (6)(i) and (ii) of this section. If your PM CEMS fails to meet these RRA criteria, it is out of control.
(i) For all three data points, the PM CEMS response value can be no greater than the greatest PM CEMS response value used to develop your correlation curve.
(ii) At least two of the three sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements must fall within the same specified area on a graph of the correlation regression line as required for the RCA and described in paragraph (5)(ii) of this section.
10.5 What do I do if my PM CEMS is out of control? If your PM CEMS is out of control, you must take the actions listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem and perform tests, as appropriate, to ensure that the corrective action was successful.
(i) Following corrective action, you must repeat the previously failed audit to confirm that your PM CEMS is operating within the specifications.
(ii) If your PM CEMS failed an RRA, you must take corrective action until your PM CEMS passes the RRA criteria. If the RRA criteria cannot be achieved, you must perform an RCA.
(iii) If your PM CEMS failed an RCA, you must follow procedures specified in section 10.6 of this procedure.
(2) You must report both the audit showing your PM CEMS to be out of control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing your PM CEMS to be operating within specifications.
10.6 What do I do if my PM CEMS fails an RCA? After an RCA failure, you must take all applicable actions listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Combine RCA data with data from the active PM CEMS correlation and perform the mathematical evaluations defined in PS-11 for development of a PM CEMS correlation, including examination of alternate correlation models (
i.e.,
linear, polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power). If the expanded data base and revised correlation meet PS-11 statistical criteria, use the revised correlation.
(2) If the criteria specified in paragraph (1) of this section are not achieved, you must develop a new PM CEMS correlation based on revised data. The revised data set must consist of the test results from only the RCA. The new data must meet all requirements of PS-11 to develop a revised PM CEMS correlation, except that the minimum number of sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements is 12 instead of the minimum of 15 sets required by PS-11. Your PM CEMS is considered to be back in controlled status when the revised correlation meets all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of PS-11.
(3) If the actions in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section do not result in an acceptable correlation, you must evaluate the cause(s) and comply with the actions listed in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section within 90 days after the completion of the failed RCA.
(i) Completely inspect your PM CEMS for mechanical or operational problems. If you find a mechanical or operational problem, repair your PM CEMS and repeat the RCA.
(ii) You may need to relocate your PM CEMS to a more appropriate measurement location. If you relocate your PM CEMS, you must perform a new correlation test according to the procedures specified in PS-11.
(iii) The characteristics of the PM or gas in your source's flue gas stream may have changed such that your PM CEMS measurement technology is no longer appropriate. If this is the case, you must install a PM CEMS with measurement technology that is appropriate for your source's flue gas characteristics. You must perform a new correlation test according to the procedures specified in PS-11.
(iv) If the corrective actions in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iii) of this section were not successful, you must petition us, the State, or local agency for approval of alternative criteria or an alternative for continuous PM monitoring.
10.7 When does the out-of-control period begin and end? The out-of-control period begins immediately after the last test run or check of an unsuccessful RCA, RRA, ACA, SVA, drift check, or sample volume check. The out-of-control period ends immediately after the last test run or check of the subsequent successful audit or drift check.
10.8 Can I use the data recorded by my PM CEMS during out-of-control periods? During any period when your PM CEMS is out of control, you may not use your PM CEMS data to calculate emission compliance or to meet minimum data availability requirements described in the applicable regulation.
10.9 What are the QA/QC reporting requirements for my PM CEMS? You must report the accuracy results for your PM CEMS, specified in section 10.4 of this procedure, at the interval specified in the applicable regulation. Report the drift and accuracy information as a Data Assessment Report (DAR), and include one copy of this DAR for each quarterly audit with the report of emissions required under the applicable regulation. An example DAR is provided in Procedure 1, Appendix F of this part.
10.10 What minimum information must I include in my DAR? As a minimum, you must include the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section in the DAR:
(1) Your name and address.
(2) Identification and location of monitors in your CEMS.
(3) Manufacturer and model number of each monitor in your CEMS.
(4) Assessment of PM CEMS data accuracy/acceptability, and date of assessment, as determined by an RCA, RRA, ACA, or SVA described in section 10, including the acceptability determination for the RCA or RRA, the accuracy for the ACA or SVA, the reference method results, the audit standards, your PM CEMS responses, and the calculation results as defined in section 12. If the accuracy audit results show your PM CEMS to be out of control, you must report both the audit results showing your PM CEMS to be out of control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing your PM CEMS to be operating within specifications.
(5) Summary of all corrective actions you took when you determined your PM CEMS to be out of control, as described in section 10.5, or after failing on RCA, as described in section 10.6.
10.7 Where and how long must I retain the QA data that this procedure requires me to record for my PM CEMS? You must keep the records required by this procedure for your PM CEMS onsite and available for inspection by us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency for a period of 5 years.

# 11.0 What Analytical Procedures Apply to This Procedure?
Sample collection and analysis are concurrent for this procedure. You must refer to the appropriate reference method for the specific analytical procedures.

# 12.0 What Calculations and Data Analysis Must I Perform for my PM CEMS?

(2) How do I calculate ACA accuracy? You must use either Equation 2-1a or 2-1b to calculate ACA accuracy for each of the three audit points. However, when calculating ACA accuracy for the first audit point (0 to 20 percent of measurement range), you must use Equation 2-1b to calculate ACA accuracy if the reference standard value (R
v
) equals zero.

CEM
, and
C
s
= The PM concentration that corresponds to the applicable emission limit in units consistent with C

.
(3) How do I calculate daily upscale and zero drift? You must calculate the upscale drift using Equation 2-2 and the zero drift using Equation 2-3:

r
= The response range of the analyzer.
(4) How do I calculate SVA accuracy? You must use Equation 2-4 to calculate the accuracy, in percent, for each of the three SVA tests or the daily sample volume check:
ER30AU16.021
Where:
SVA Accuracy = The SVA accuracy at each audit point, in percent,
V
M
= Sample gas volume determined/reported by your PM CEMS (
e.g.,
dscm), and
V
R
= Sample gas volume measured by the independent calibrated reference device (
e.g.,

# Procedure 3—Quality Assurance Requirements for Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 What are the purpose and applicability of Procedure 3?
The purpose of Procedure 3 is to establish quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS). Procedure 3 applies to COMS used to demonstrate continuous compliance with opacity standards specified in new source performance standards (NSPS) promulgated by EPA pursuant to section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7411(b)—Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources.
1.1
What are the data quality objectives of Procedure 3?
The overall data quality objective (DQO) of Procedure 3 is the generation of valid and representative opacity data. Procedure 3 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of COMS data submitted to us or the delegated regulatory agency. Procedure 3 requires you to perform periodic evaluations of a COMS performance and to develop and implement QA/QC programs to ensure that COMS data quality is maintained.
1.2
What is the intent of the QA/QC procedures specified in Procedure 3?
Procedure 3 is intended to establish the minimum QA/QC requirements to verify and maintain an acceptable level of quality of the data produced by COMS. It is presented in general terms to allow you to develop a program that is most effective for your circumstances.
1.3
When must I comply with Procedure 3?
You must comply with Procedure 3 no later than November 12, 2014.

# 2.0 What are the basic functions of Procedure 3?
The basic functions of Procedure 3 are assessment of the quality of your COMS data and control and improvement of the quality of the data by implementing QC requirements and corrective actions. Procedure 3 provides requirements for:
(1) Daily instrument zero and upscale drift checks and status indicators checks;
(2) Quarterly performance audits which include the following assessments:
(i) Optical alignment,
(ii) Calibration error, and
(iii) Zero compensation.
Sources that achieve quality assured data for four consecutive quarters may reduce their auditing frequency to semi-annual. If a performance audit is failed, the source must resume quarterly testing for that audit requirement until it again demonstrates successful performance over four consecutive quarters.
(3) Annual zero alignment.

# 3.0 What special definitions apply to Procedure 3?
The definitions in Procedure 3 include those provided in Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of Appendix B of this part and ASTM D6216-12 and the following additional definitions.
3.1 Out-of-control periods.
Out-of-control periods mean that one or more COMS parameters falls outside of the acceptable limits established by this rule.
(1)
Daily Assessments.
Whenever the calibration drift (CD) exceeds twice the specification of PS-1, the COMS is out-of-control. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the daily calibration drift check. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of appropriate adjustment and subsequent successful CD assessment.
(2)
Quarterly and Annual Assessments.
Whenever an annual zero alignment or quarterly performance audit fails to meet the criteria established in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 10.4, the COMS is out-of-control. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the performance audit indicating the failure to meet these established criteria. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of appropriate corrective actions and the subsequent successful audit (or, if applicable, partial audit).

# 4.0 What interferences must I avoid?
Opacity cannot be measured accurately in the presence of condensed water vapor. Thus, COMS opacity compliance determinations cannot be made when condensed water vapor is present, such as downstream of a wet scrubber without a reheater or at other saturated flue gas locations. Therefore, COMS must be located where condensed water vapor is not present.

# 5.0 What do I need to know to ensure the safety of persons using Procedure 3?
Those implementing Procedure 3 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations and equipment. Procedure 3 does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate health and safety practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing this procedure. You should consult the COMS user's manual for specific precautions to take.

# 6.0 What equipment and supplies do I need?
The equipment and supplies that you need are specified in PS-1. You are not required to purchase a new COMS if your existing COMS meets the requirements specified in Procedure 3.

# 7.0 What reagents and standards do I need?
The reagents and standards that you need are specified in PS-1. You are not required to purchase a new COMS if your existing COMS meets the requirements specified in Procedure 3.

# 8.0 What sample collection, preservation, storage, and transport are relevant to this procedure? [Reserved]

# 9.0 What quality control measures are required by this procedure for my COMS?
You must develop and implement a QC program for your COMS. Your QC program must, at a minimum, include written procedures which describe in detail complete step-by-step procedures and operations for the activities in paragraphs (1) through (4):
(1) Procedures for performing drift checks, including both zero and upscale drift and the status indicators check,
(2) Procedures for performing quarterly performance audits,
(3) A means of checking the zero alignment of the COMS, and
(4) A program of corrective action for a malfunctioning COMS. The corrective action must include, at a minimum, the requirements specified in section 10.5.
9.1
What QA/QC documentation must I have?
You are required to keep the QA/QC written procedures required in section 9.0 on site and available for inspection by us, the state, and/or local enforcement agencies.
9.2
What actions must I take if I fail QC audits?
If you fail two consecutive annual audits, two consecutive quarterly audits, or five consecutive daily checks, you must either revise your QC procedures or determine if your COMS is malfunctioning. If you determine that your COMS is malfunctioning, you must take the necessary corrective action as specified in section 10.5. If you determine that your COMS requires extensive repairs, you may use a substitute COMS provided the substitute meets the requirements in section 10.6.

# 10.0 What calibration and standardization procedures must I perform for my COMS?
(1) You must perform daily system checks to ensure proper operation of system electronics and optics, light and radiation sources and detectors, electric or electro-mechanical systems, and general stability of the system calibration. Daily is defined as any portion of a calendar day in which a unit operates.
(2) You must subject your COMS to a performance audit to include checks of the individual COMS components and factors affecting the accuracy of the monitoring data at least once per QA operating quarter. A QA operating quarter is a calendar quarter in which a unit operates at least 168 hours.
(3) At least annually, you must perform a zero alignment by comparing the COMS simulated zero to the actual clear path zero. Annually is defined as a period wherein the unit is operating at least 28 days in a calendar year. The simulated zero device produces a simulated clear path condition or low-level
opacity condition, where the energy reaching the detector is between 90 and 110 percent of the energy reaching the detector under actual clear path conditions.
10.1
What daily system checks must I perform on my COMS?
The specific components required to undergo daily system checks will depend on the design details of your COMS. At a minimum, you must verify the system operating parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section. Some COMS may perform one or more of these functions automatically or as an integral portion of unit operations; other COMS may perform one or more of these functions manually.
(1) You must check the zero drift to ensure stability of your COMS response to the simulated zero device. The simulated zero device, an automated mechanism within the transmissometer that produces a simulated clear path condition or low-level opacity condition, is used to check the zero drift. You must, at a minimum, take corrective action on your COMS whenever the daily zero drift exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.3(6) of PS-1.
(2) You must check the upscale drift to ensure stability of your COMS response to the upscale drift value. The upscale calibration device, an automated mechanism (employing an attenuator or reduced reflectance device) within the transmissometer that produces an upscale opacity value is used to check the upscale drift. You must, at a minimum, take corrective action on your COMS whenever the daily upscale drift check exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.3(6) of PS-1.
(3) You must, at a minimum, check the status indicators, data acquisition system error messages, and other system self-diagnostic indicators. You must take appropriate corrective action based on the manufacturer's recommendations when the COMS is operating outside preset limits.
10.2
What are the quarterly auditing requirements for my COMS?
At a minimum, the parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section must be included in the performance audit conducted on a quarterly basis as defined in section 10.0(2).
(1) For units with automatic zero compensation, you must determine the zero compensation for the COMS. The value of the zero compensation applied at the time of the audit must be calculated as equivalent opacity and corrected to stack exit conditions according to the procedures specified by the manufacturer. The compensation applied to the effluent by the monitor system must be recorded.
(2) You must conduct a three-point calibration error test of the COMS. Three calibration attenuators, either primary or secondary must meet the requirements of PS-1, with one exception. Instead of recalibrating the attenuators semi-annually, they must be recalibrated annually. If two annual calibrations agree within 0.5 percent opacity, the attenuators may then be calibrated once every five years. The three attenuators must be placed in the COMS light beam path for at least three nonconsecutive readings. All monitor responses must then be independently recorded from the COMS permanent data recorder. Additional guidance for conducting this test is included in section 8.1(3)(ii) of PS-1. The low-, mid-, and high-range calibration error results must be computed as the mean difference and 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the expected and actual responses of the monitor as corrected to stack exit conditions. The equations necessary to perform the calculations are found in section 12.0 of PS-1. For the calibration error test method, you must use the external audit device. When the external audit device is installed, with no calibration attenuator inserted, the COMS measurement reading must be less than or equal to one percent opacity. You must also document procedures for properly handling and storing the external audit device and calibration attenuators within your written QC program.
(3) You must check the optical alignment of the COMS in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's recommendations. If the optical alignment varies with stack temperature, perform the optical alignment test when the unit is operating.
10.3
What are the annual auditing requirements for my COMS?
(1) You must perform the primary zero alignment method under clear path conditions. The COMS must be removed from its installation and set up under clear path conditions. There must be no adjustments to the monitor other than the establishment of the proper monitor path length and correct optical alignment of the COMS components. You must record the COMS response to a clear condition and to the COMS's simulated zero condition as percent opacity corrected to stack exit conditions. For a COMS with automatic zero compensation, you must disconnect or disable the zero compensation mechanism or record the amount of correction applied to the COMS's simulated zero condition. The response difference in percent opacity to the clear path and simulated zero conditions must be recorded as the zero alignment error. You must adjust the COMS's simulated zero device to provide the same response as the clear path condition as specified in paragraph (3) of section 10.0.
(2) As an alternative, monitors capable of allowing the installation of an external zero device may use the device for the zero alignment provided that: (1) The external zero device setting has been established for the monitor path length and recorded for the specific COMS by comparison of the COMS
responses to the installed external zero device and to the clear path condition, and (2) the external zero device is demonstrated to be capable of producing a consistent zero response when it is repeatedly (i.e., three consecutive installations and removals prior to conducting the final zero alignment check) installed on the COMS. This can be demonstrated by either the manufacturer's certificate of conformance (MCOC) or actual on-site performance. The external zero device setting must be permanently set at the time of initial zeroing to the clear path zero value and protected when not in use to ensure that the setting equivalent to zero opacity does not change. The external zero device response must be checked and recorded prior to initiating the zero alignment. If the external zero device setting has changed, you must remove the COMS from the stack in order to reset the external zero device. If you employ an external zero device, you must perform the zero alignment audits with the COMS off the stack at least every three years. If the external zero device is adjusted within the three-year period, you must perform the zero alignment with the COMS off the stack no later than three years from the date of adjustment.
(3) The procedure in section 6.8 of ASTM D6216-12 is allowed.
10.4
What are my limits for excessive audit inaccuracy?
Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are listed in paragraphs (1) through (4).
(1) What is the criterion for excessive zero or upscale drift? Your COMS is out-of-control if either the zero drift check or upscale drift check exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in PS-1 for any one day.
(2) What is the criterion for excessive zero alignment? Your COMS is out-of-control if the zero alignment error exceeds 2 percent opacity.
(3) What is the criterion to pass the quarterly performance audit? Your COMS is out-of-control if the results of a quarterly performance audit indicate noncompliance with the following criteria:
(i) The optical alignment indicator does not show proper alignment (i.e., does not fall within a specific reference mark or condition).
(ii) The zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity, or
(iii) The calibration error exceeds 3 percent opacity.
(4) What is the criterion for data capture? You must adhere to the data capture criterion specified in the applicable subpart.
10.5
What corrective action must I take if my COMS is malfunctioning?
You must have a corrective action program in place to address the repair and/or maintenance of your COMS. The corrective action program must address routine/preventative maintenance and various types of analyzer repairs. The corrective action program must establish what diagnostic testing must be performed after each type of activity to ensure that the COMS is collecting valid, quality-assured data.

10.6
What requirements must I meet if I use a temporary opacity monitor?
(1) In the event that your certified opacity monitor has to be removed for extended service, you may install a temporary replacement monitor to obtain required opacity emissions data provided that:
(i) The temporary monitor has been certified according to ASTM D6216-12 for which a MCOC has been provided;
(ii) The use of the temporary monitor does not exceed 1080 hours (45 days) of operation per year as a replacement for a fully certified opacity monitor. After that time, the analyzer must complete a full certification according to PS-1 prior to further use as a temporary replacement monitor. Once a temporary replacement monitor has been installed and required testing and adjustments have been successfully completed, it cannot be replaced by another temporary replacement monitor to avoid the full PS-1 certification testing required after 1080 hours (45 days) of use;
(iii) The temporary monitor has been installed and successfully completed an optical alignment assessment and status indicator assessment;
(iv) The temporary monitor has successfully completed an off-stack clear path zero assessment and zero calibration value adjustment procedure;
(v) The temporary monitor has successfully completed an abbreviated zero and upscale drift check consisting of seven zero and upscale calibration value drift checks which may be conducted within a 24-hour period with not more than one calibration drift check every three hours and not less than one calibration drift check every 25 hours. Calculated zero and upscale drift requirements are the same as specified for the normal PS-1 certification;
(vi) The temporary monitor has successfully completed a three-point calibration error test;
(vii) The upscale reference calibration check value of the new monitor has been updated in the associated data recording equipment;
(viii) The overall calibration of the monitor and data recording equipment has been verified; and
(ix) The user has documented all of the above in the maintenance log.
(2) Data generated by the temporary monitor is considered valid when paragraphs (i) through (ix) in this section have been met.
10.7
When do out-of-control periods begin and end?
The out-of-control periods are as specified in section 3.1.
10.8
What are the limitations on the use of my COMS data collected during out-of-control periods?
During the period your COMS is out-of-control, you may not use your COMS data to calculate emission compliance or to meet minimum data capture requirements in this procedure or the applicable regulation.
10.9
What are the QA/QC reporting requirements for my COMS?
You must report in a Data Assessment Report (DAR) the information required by sections 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 for your COMS at the interval specified in the applicable regulation.
10.10
What minimum information must I include in my DAR?
At a minimum, you must include the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section in the DAR.
(1) Name of person completing the report and facility address,
(2) Identification and location of your COMS(s),
(3) Manufacturer, model, and serial number of your COMS(s),
(4) Assessment of COMS data accuracy/acceptability and date of assessment as determined by a performance audit described in section 10.0. If the accuracy audit results show your COMS to be out-of-control, you must report both the audit results showing your COMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing your COMS to be operating within specifications, and
(5) Summary of all corrective actions you took when you determined your COMS was out-of-control.
10.11
Where and how long must I retain the QA data that this procedure requires me to record for my COMS?
You must keep the records required by this procedure for your COMS on site and available for inspection by us, the state, and/or the local enforcement agency for the period specified in the regulations requiring the use of COMS.

# Procedure 5. Quality Assurance Requirements for Vapor Phase Mercury Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems and Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. The purpose of Procedure 5 is to establish the minimum requirements for evaluating the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures as well as the quality of data produced by vapor phase mercury (Hg) continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) and sorbent trap monitoring systems. Procedure 5 applies to Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems used for continuously determining compliance with emission standards or operating permit limits as specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Other QA/QC procedures may apply to other auxiliary monitoring equipment that may be needed to determine Hg emissions in the units of measure specified in an applicable permit or regulation.
Procedure 5 covers the measurement of Hg emissions as defined in Performance Specification 12A (PS 12A) and Performance Specification 12B (PS 12B) in appendix B to this part,
i.e.,
total vapor phase Hg representing the sum of the elemental (Hg°, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized (Hg
+2
) forms of gaseous Hg.
Procedure 5 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring system data submitted to EPA or a delegated permitting authority. You must meet these minimum requirements if you are responsible for one or more Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems used for compliance monitoring. We encourage you to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.
You must comply with the basic requirements of Procedure 5 immediately following successful completion of the initial performance test described in PS 12A or PS 12B in appendix B to this part (as applicable).
1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the
quality of the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control loop: When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the quality control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies assessment methods for calibration drift, system integrity, and accuracy. Several of the procedures are based on those of PS 12A and PS 12B in appendix B to this part. Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective and efficient for the circumstances.

# 2.0 Definitions
2.1
Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System (Hg CEMS)
means the equipment required for the determination of the total vapor phase Hg concentration in the stack effluent. The Hg CEMS consists of the following major subsystems:
2.1.1
Sample Interface
means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, and protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.
2.1.2
Hg Analyzer
means that portion of the Hg CEMS that measures the total vapor phase Hg concentration and generates a proportional output.
2.1.3
Data Recorder
means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent electronic record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may provide automatic data reduction and CEMS control capabilities.
2.2
Sorbent Trap Monitoring System
means the total equipment required for the collection of gaseous Hg samples using paired three-partition sorbent traps as described in PS 12B in appendix B to this part.
2.3
Span Value
means the measurement range as specified for the affected source category in the applicable regulation and/or monitoring performance specification.
2.4
Zero, Mid-Level, and High Level Values
means the reference gas concentrations used for calibration drift assessments and system integrity checks on a Hg CEMS, expressed as percentages of the span value (
see
section 7.1 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part).
2.5
Calibration Drift (CD)
means the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and either the upscale elemental Hg reference gas or the zero-level elemental Hg reference gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
2.6
System Integrity (SI) Check
means a test procedure assessing transport and measurement of oxidized Hg by a Hg CEMS. In particular, system integrity is expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and the reference value of either a mid- or high-level mercuric chloride (HgCl
2
) reference gas, as a percentage of span, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged.
2.7
Relative Accuracy (RA)
means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant concentrations determined by a continuous monitoring system (e.g., Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system) and the values determined by a reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for sources with an average RM concentration less than 5.0 micrograms per standard cubic meter (µg/scm), the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean CEMS and RM values.
2.8
Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA)
means an audit test procedure consisting of at least nine runs, in which the accuracy of the total vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by a CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is evaluated by comparison against concurrent measurements made with a reference test method.
2.9
Quarterly Gas Audit (QGA)
means an audit procedure in which the accuracy of the total vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by a CEMS is evaluated by challenging the CEMS with a zero and two upscale reference gases.

# 3.0 QC Requirements
3.1 Each source owner or operator must develop and implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities (as applicable):
(a) Calibration drift (CD) checks of Hg CEMS.
(b) CD determination and adjustment of Hg CEMS.
(c) Weekly system integrity check procedures for Hg CEMS.
(d) Routine operation, maintenance, and QA/QC procedures for sorbent trap monitoring systems.
(e) Routine and preventive maintenance procedures for Hg CEMS (including spare parts inventory).
(f) Data recording, calculations, and reporting.
(g) Accuracy audit procedures for Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems including sampling and analysis methods.
(h) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems.
These written procedures must be kept on record and available for inspection by the responsible enforcement agency. Also, as noted in section 5.2.4, below, whenever excessive inaccuracies of a Hg CEMS occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the current written procedures or modify or replace the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.

# 4.0 Calibration Drift (CD) Assessment and Weekly System Integrity Check
4.1 CD Requirement. As described in 40 CFR 60.13(d) and 63.8(c), source owners and operators of Hg CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two concentration values at least once daily (approximately 24 hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The Hg CEMS calibration must, as minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily zero (or low-level) CD or the daily high-level CD exceeds two times the limits of the applicable PS in appendix B of this part.
4.2 Recording Requirement for Automatic CD Adjusting CEMS. CEMS that automatically adjust the data to the corrected calibration values (e.g., microprocessor control) must either be programmed to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the CD prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or to record the amount of adjustment.
4.3 Criteria for Excessive CD. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.2 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part for five, consecutive, daily periods, the CEMS is out-of-control. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds four times the applicable drift specification in PS 12A during any CD check, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. Following corrective action, repeat the CD checks.
4.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the fifth, consecutive, daily CD check with a CD in excess of two times the allowable limit, or the time corresponding to the completion of the daily CD check preceding the daily CD check that results in a CD in excess of four times the allowable limit. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the CD check following corrective action that results in the CD's at both the zero (or low-level) and high-level measurement points being within the corresponding allowable CD limit (
i.e.,
either two times or four times the allowable limit in the applicable PS in appendix B).
4.3.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used either to determine compliance with an emission limit or to meet a minimum data availability requirement specified in an applicable regulation or permit.
4.4 Weekly System Integrity Check. At least once every 7 operating days, using the procedure described in section 8.3.3 of Performance Specification 12A in appendix B to this part, source owners and operators of Hg CEMS must use a single mid- or high-level oxidized Hg (mercuric chloride, HgCl
2
) reference gas to assess transport and measurement of oxidized mercury. The absolute value of the difference between the Hg CEMS output response and the reference gas must be less than or equal to 10.0 percent of the reference gas value or 0.8 µg/scm.

# 5.0 Data Accuracy Assessment
5.1 Hg CEMS Audit Requirements. For each Hg CEMS, an accuracy audit must be performed at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits must, to the extent practicable, be performed no less than 2 months apart. The audits must be conducted as follows:
5.1.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). A RATA of the Hg CEMS must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in section 5.1.4 of this appendix. Perform the RATA as described in section 8.5 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part. Calculate the results according to section 12.4 of PS 12A.
5.1.2 Quarterly Gas Audit. A quarterly gas audit (QGA) may be conducted in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To perform a QGA, challenge the CEMS with a zero-level and two upscale level audit gases of known concentrations, first of elemental Hg and then of oxidized Hg, within the following ranges:
Audit point
Audit range
1
20 to 30% of span value.
2
50 to 60% of span value.
Sequentially inject each of the three audit gases (zero and two upscale), three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.
Use elemental Hg and oxidized Hg (mercuric chloride, HgCl
2
) audit gases that are
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-certified or NIST-traceable following an EPA Traceability Protocol. If audit gas cylinders are used, do not dilute gas when challenging the Hg CEMS. For each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the reference gas value. Calculate the measurement error at each gas level using Equation 12A-1 in section 8.2 of PS 12A.
5.1.3 Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). As an alternative to the QGA, a RAA may be conducted in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct a RAA, follow the RATA test procedures in section 8.5 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part, except that only three test runs are required. Calculate the relative accuracy according to equation 1-1 of Procedure 1 of this appendix.
5.1.4 Alternative Quarterly Audits. Alternative quarterly audit procedures may be used as approved by the Administrator for three of four calendar quarters. One RATA is required at least every four calendar quarters, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate) in the fourth calendar quarter since the quarter of the previous RATA. In that case, the RATA must be performed in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Also, quarterly gas audits (or RAAs, if applicable) are not required for calendar quarters in which the affected facility does not operate.
5.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Audit Requirements. For each sorbent trap monitoring system, a RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in section 5.1.4 of this appendix. Perform the RATA as described in section 8.3 of PS 12B in appendix B to this part. Calculate the results according to section 12.4 of PS 12A.
5.3 Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the results of a RATA, QGA, or RAA exceed the applicable criteria in section 5.3.3, the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is out-of-control. If the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the source owner or operator must audit the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system using the same type of test that failed to meet the accuracy criterion. For instance, a RATA must always be performed following an out-of-control period resulting from a failed RATA. Whenever audit results show the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to be out-of-control, the owner or operator must report both the results of the failed test and the results of the retest following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.
5.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour immediately following the completion of a RATA, RAA, QGA or system integrity check that fails to meet the applicable performance criteria in section 5.3.3, below. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of a subsequent successful test of the same type.
5.3.2 Monitoring Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the monitor is out-of-control, the monitoring data may not be used to determine compliance with an applicable emission limit or to meet a minimum data availability requirement in an applicable regulation or permit.
5.3.3 Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in an applicable regulation or permit, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:
(a) For the RATA, the allowable RA in the applicable PS in appendix B (e.g., PS 12A or PS 12B).
(b) For the QGA, ±15 percent of the average audit value or ±0.5 µg/m
3
, whichever is greater.
(c) For the RAA, ±20 percent of the three run average or ±10 percent of the applicable standard, whichever is greater.
5.3.4 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedures. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (
i.e.,
out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly audits) indicates the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the QC procedures (
see
section 3) or modify, repair, or replace the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system.

# 6.0 Reporting Requirements
6.1 Data Assessment Report. At the reporting interval specified in the applicable regulation or permit, report for each Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system the accuracy assessment results from section 5, above. For Hg CEMS, also report the CD assessment results from section 4, above. Report this information as a Data Assessment Report (DAR), and include the appropriate DAR(s) with the emissions report required under the applicable regulation or permit.
6.2 Contents of the DAR. At a minimum, the DAR must contain the following information:
6.2.1 Facility name and address including identification of source owner/operator.
6.2.2 Identification and location of each Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system.
6.2.3 Manufacturer, model, and serial number of each Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system.
6.2.4 CD Assessment for each Hg CEMS, including the identification of out-of-control periods.
6.2.5 System integrity check data for each Hg CEMS.
6.2.6 Accuracy assessment for each Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system, including the identification of out-of-control periods. The results of all required RATAs, QGAs, RAAs, and audits of auxiliary equipment must be reported. If an accuracy audit shows a CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to be out-of-control, report both the audit results that caused the out-of-control period and the results of the retest following corrective action, showing the monitoring system to be operating within specifications.
6.2.7 Summary of all corrective actions taken when the Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system was determined to be out-of-control.
6.3 Data Retention. As required in 40 CFR 60.7(d) and 63.10(b), all measurements from CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems, including the quality assurance data required by this procedure, must be retained by the source owner for at least 5 years.

# Procedure 6. Quality Assurance Requirements for Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination at Stationary Sources

# 1.0 Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. Procedure 6 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and evaluate the quality of data produced by any hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, CAS: 7647-01-0, continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that is used for determining compliance with emission standards for HCl on a continuous basis as specified in an applicable permit or regulation.
1.1.1 This procedure specifies the minimum QA requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a delegated authority. If you are responsible for one or more CEMS used for HCl compliance monitoring you must meet these minimum requirements and you are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.
1.1.2 Data collected as a result of QA and QC measures required in this procedure are to be submitted to the EPA or the delegated authority in accordance with the applicable regulation or permit. These data are to be used by both the delegated authority and you, as the CEMS operator, in assessing the effectiveness of the CEMS QC and QA procedures in the maintenance of acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.

# 1.2 Principle
1.2.1 The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form an iterative control loop. When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure specifies the assessment procedures to evaluate response drift and accuracy. The procedures specified are based on Performance Specification 18 (PS-18) in appendix B to this part.
(
Note:
Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow you, as source owner or operator to develop the most effective and efficient QC system for your circumstances.)

# 2.0 Definitions
See PS-18 of this subpart for the primary definitions used in this Procedure.

# 3.0 QC Requirements
3.1 You, as a source owner or operator, must develop and implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures and/or manufacturer's information which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities:
(a) Calibration Drift (CD) checks of CEMS;
(b) CD determination and adjustment of CEMS;
(c) Integrated Path (IP) CEMS temperature and pressure sensor accuracy checks;
(d) IP CEMS beam intensity checks;
(e) Routine and preventative maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory);
(f) Data recording, calculations, and reporting;
(g) Accuracy audit procedures for CEMS including reference method(s); and
(h) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.
3.2 These written procedures must be kept on site and available for inspection by the delegated authority. As described in section 5.4, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the current written procedures, or modify or replace the CEMS to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.

# 4.0 Daily Data Quality Requirements and Measurement Standardization Procedures
4.1 CD Assessment. An upscale gas, used to meet a requirement in this section must be either a NIST-traceable reference gas or a gas certified by the gas vendor to ±5.0 percent accuracy.
4.1.1 CD Requirement. Consistent with 40 CFR 60.13(d) and 63.8(c), you, as source owners or operators of CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two levels, using a zero gas and mid-level gas at least once daily (approximately every 24 hours). Perform the CD check in accordance with the procedure in applicable performance specification (
e.g.,
section 11.8 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part). The daily zero- and mid-level CD must not exceed two times the drift limits specified in the applicable performance specification (
e.g.,
section 13.2 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.)
4.1.2 Recording Requirement for CD Corrective action. Corrective actions taken to bring a CEMS back in control after exceeding a CD limit must be recorded and reported with the associated CEMS data. Reporting corrective action must include the unadjusted concentration measured prior to resetting the calibration and the adjusted value after resetting the calibration to bring the CEMS back into control.
4.1.3 Dynamic Spiking Option for Mid-level CD. For extractive CEMS, you have the option to conduct a daily dynamic spiking procedure found in section 11.8.8 of PS-18 of appendix B of this part in lieu of the daily mid-level CD check. If this option is selected, the daily zero CD check is still required.
4.1.4 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive CD. As specified in § 63.8(c)(7)(i)(A), a CEMS is out of control if the zero or mid-level CD exceeds two times the applicable CD specification in the applicable PS or in the relevant standard. When a CEMS is out of control, you as owner or operator of the affected source must take the necessary corrective actions and repeat the tests that caused the system to go out of control (in this case, the failed CD check) until the applicable performance requirements are met.
4.1.5 Additional Quality Assurance for Data above Span. This procedure must be used when required by an applicable regulation and may be used when significant data above span are being collected. Furthermore, the terms of this procedure do not apply to the extent that alternate terms are otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit.
4.1.5.1 Any time the average measured concentration of HCl exceeds 150 percent of the span value for two consecutive one-hour averages, conduct the following 'above span' CEMS response check.
4.1.5.1.1 Within a period of 24 hours (before or after) of the 'above span' period, introduce a higher, 'above span' HCl reference gas standard to the CEMS. Use 'above span' reference gas that meets the requirements of section 7.0 of PS-18 and target a concentration level between 75 and 125 percent of the highest hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span.
4.1.5.1.2 Introduce the reference gas at the probe for extractive CEMS or for IP-CEMS as an equivalent path length corrected concentration in the instrument calibration cell.
4.1.5.1.3 At no time may the 'above span' concentration exceed the analyzer full-scale range.
4.1.5.2 Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The 'above span' response check is successful if the value measured by the CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas.
4.1.5.3 If the 'above span' response check is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect at least one data point in an hour due to the response check duration, then determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour.
4.1.5.4 In the event that the 'above span' response check is not successful (
i.e.,
the CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the 'above span' response check for reporting based on the CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Eq. 6-1:
ER07JY15.096

# 4.2 Beam Intensity Requirement for HCl IP-CEMS.
4.2.1 Beam Intensity Measurement. If you use a HCl IP-CEMS, you must quantify and record the beam intensity of the IP-CEMS in appropriate units at least once daily (approximately 24 hours apart) according to manufacturer's specifications and procedures.
4.2.2 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Beam Intensity Loss. If the beam intensity falls below the level established for the operation range determined following the procedures in section 11.2 of PS-18 of this part, then your CEMS is out-of-control. This quality check is independent of whether the CEMS daily CD is acceptable. If your CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. You have the option to repeat the beam intensity test procedures in section 11.2 of PS-18 to expand the acceptable range of acceptable beam intensity. Following corrective action, repeat the beam intensity check.
4.3 Out Of Control Period Duration for Daily Assessments. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour in which the owner or operator conducts a daily performance check (
e.g.,
calibration drift or beam intensity check) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this procedure. The end of the out-of-control period is the completion of daily assessment of the same type following corrective actions, which shows that the applicable performance requirements have been met.
4.4 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating compliance with an emissions limit nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.

# 5.0 Data Accuracy Assessment
You must audit your CEMS for the accuracy of HCl measurement on a regular basis at the frequency described in this section, unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Quarterly audits are performed at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits, to the extent practicable, shall occur no closer than 2 months apart. Annual audits are performed at least once every four consecutive calendar quarters.

# 5.1 Temperature and Pressure Accuracy Assessment for IP CEMS.
5.1.1 Stack or source gas temperature measurement audits for HCl IP-CEMS must be conducted and recorded at least annually in accordance with the procedure described in section 11.3 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. As an alternative, temperature measurement devices may be replaced with certified instruments on an annual basis. Units removed from service may be bench tested against an NIST traceable sensor and reused during subsequent years. Any measurement instrument or device that is used to conduct ongoing verification of temperature measurement must have an accuracy that is traceable to NIST.
5.1.2 Stack or source gas pressure measurement audits for HCl IP-CEMS must be conducted and recorded at least annually in accordance with the procedure described in section 11.4 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part. As an alternative, pressure measurement devices may be replaced with certified instruments on an annual basis. Units removed from service may be bench tested against an NIST traceable sensor and reused during subsequent years. Any measurement instrument or device that is used to conduct ongoing verification of pressure measurement must have an accuracy that is traceable to NIST.
5.1.3 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Parameter Verification Inaccuracy. If the temperature or pressure verification audit exceeds the criteria in sections 5.3.4.5 and 5.3.4.6, respectively, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, you must repeat the failed verification audit until the temperature or pressure measurement device is operating within the applicable specifications, at which point the out-of-control period ends.
5.2 Concentration Accuracy Auditing Requirements. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit, you must audit the HCl measurement accuracy of each CEMS at least once each calendar quarter, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate). In that case, the audit must be performed as soon as is practicable in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Successive quarterly audits must, to the extent practicable, be performed no less than 2 months apart. The accuracy audits shall be conducted as follows:
5.2.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit. A RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in sections 5.2.5 or 5.5 of this procedure. Perform the RATA as described in section 11.9 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. If the HCl concentration measured by the RM during a RATA (in ppmv) is less than or equal to 20 percent of the concentration equivalent to the applicable emission standard, you must perform a Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) or a Dynamic Spike Audit (DSA) for at least one subsequent (one of the following three) quarterly accuracy audits.
5.2.2 Quarterly Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). A quarterly RAA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct an RAA, follow the test procedures in section 11.9 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part, except that only three test runs are required. The difference between the mean of the RM values and the mean of the CEMS responses relative to the mean of the RM values (or alternatively the emission standard) is used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS. Calculate the RAA results as described in section 6.2. As an alternative to an RAA, a cylinder gas audit or a dynamic spiking audit may be conducted.
5.2.3 Cylinder Gas Audit. A quarterly CGA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three consecutive quarters. To perform a CGA, challenge the CEMS with a zero-level and two upscale level audit gases of known concentrations within the following ranges:
Audit point
Audit range
1 (Mid-Level)
50 to 60% of span value.
2 (High-Level)
80 to 100% of span value.
5.2.3.1 Inject each of the three audit gases (zero and two upscale) three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.
5.2.3.2 Use HCl audit gases that meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.
5.2.3.3 Calculate results as described in section 6.3.
5.2.4 Dynamic Spiking Audit. For extractive CEMS, a quarterly DSA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession.
5.2.4.1 To conduct a DSA, you must challenge the entire HCl CEMS with a zero gas in accordance with the procedure in section 11.8 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part. You must also conduct the DS procedure as described in appendix A to PS-18 of appendix B to this part. You must conduct three spike injections with each of two upscale level audit gases. The upscale level gases must meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part and must be chosen to yield concentrations at the analyzer of 50 to 60 percent of span and 80 to 100 percent of span. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.
5.2.4.2 Calculate results as described in section 6.4. To determine CEMS accuracy, you must calculate the dynamic spiking error (DSE) for each of the two upscale audit gases using Equation A5 in appendix A to PS-18 and Equation 6-3 in section 6.4 of Procedure 6 in appendix B to this part.
5.2.5 Other Alternative Quarterly Audits. Other alternative audit procedures, as approved by the Administrator, may be used for three of four calendar quarters.
5.3 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the results of the RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA do not meet the applicable performance criteria in section 5.3.4, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the CEMS must pass a test of the same type that resulted in the out-of-control period to determine if the CEMS is operating within the specifications (
e.g.,
a RATA must always follow an out-of-control period resulting from a RATA).
5.3.1 If the audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, you must report both the results of the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.
5.3.2 Out-Of-Control Period Duration for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling for the failed RATA, RAA, CGA or DSA. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent successful audit.
5.3.3 CEMS Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.
5.3.4 Criteria for Excessive Quarterly and Yearly Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in the applicable regulation or permit, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:
5.3.4.1 For the RATA, the CEMS must meet the RA specifications in section 13.4 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.
5.3.4.2 For the CGA, the accuracy must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations.
5.3.4.3 For the RAA, the RA must not exceed 20.0 percent of the RM
avg
as calculated using Equation 6-2 in section 6.2 of this procedure whether calculated in units of HCl concentration or in units of the emission standard. In cases where the RA is calculated on a concentration (ppmv) basis, if the average HCl concentration measured by the RM during the test is less than 75 percent of the HCl concentration equivalent to the applicable standard, you may substitute the equivalent emission standard value (in ppmvw) in the denominator of Equation 6-2 in the place of RM
avg
and the result of this alternative calculation of RA must not exceed 15.0 percent.
5.3.4.4 For DSA, the accuracy must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations or 20.0 percent of the applicable emission standard, whichever is greater.
5.3.4.5 For the gas temperature measurement audit, the CEMS must satisfy the requirements in section 13.7 in PS-18 of appendix B to this part.
5.3.4.6 For the gas pressure measurement audit, the CEMS must satisfy the requirements in section 13.8 in PS-18 of appendix B to this part.
5.4 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedures. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (
i.e.,
out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly or yearly audits) indicate that the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the QC procedures (see section 3.0) or modify or replace the CEMS.
5.5 Criteria for Optional QA Test Frequency. If all the quality criteria are met in sections 4 and 5 of this procedure, the CEMS is in-control.
5.5.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit, if the CEMS is in-control and if your source emits ≤75 percent of the HCl emission limit for each averaging period as specified in the relevant standard for eight consecutive quarters that include a minimum of two RATAs, you may revise your auditing procedures to use CGA, RAA or DSA each quarter for seven subsequent quarters following a RATA.
5.5.2 You must perform at least one RATA that meets the acceptance criteria every 2 years.
5.5.3 If you fail a RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA, then the audit schedule in section 5.2 must be followed until the audit results meet the criteria in section 5.3.4 to start requalifying for the optional QA test frequency in section 5.5.

# 6.0 Calculations for CEMS Data Accuracy
6.1 RATA RA Calculation. Follow Equations 9 through 14 in section 12 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part to calculate the RA for the RATA. The RATA must be calculated either in units of the applicable emission standard or in concentration units (ppmv).
6.2 RAA Accuracy Calculation. Use Equation 6-2 to calculate the accuracy for the RAA. The RA may be calculated in concentration units (ppmv) or in the units of the applicable emission standard.
ER07JY15.097
Where:
RA = Accuracy of the CEMS (percent)
MN
avg
= Average measured CEMS response during the audit in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
RM
avg
= Average reference method value in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
6.3 CGA Accuracy Calculation. For each gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the audit gas value. For extractive CEMS, calculate the ME at each gas level using Equation 3A in section 12.3 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. For IP-CEMS, calculate the ME at each gas level using Equation 6A in section 12.4.3 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.
6.4 DSA Accuracy Calculation. DSA accuracy is calculated as a percent of span. To calculate the DSA accuracy for each upscale spike concentration, first calculate the DSE using Equation A5 in appendix A of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. Then use Equation 6-3 to calculate the average DSA accuracy for each upscale spike concentration. To calculate DSA accuracy at the zero level, use equation 3A in section 12.3 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.
ER07JY15.098

# 7.0 Reporting Requirements
At the reporting interval specified in the applicable regulation or permit, report for each CEMS the quarterly and annual accuracy audit results from section 6 and the daily assessment results from section 4. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation or permit, include all data sheets, calculations, CEMS data records (
i.e.,
charts, records of CEMS responses), reference gas certifications and reference method results necessary to confirm that the performance of the CEMS met the performance specifications.
7.1 Unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulations or permit, report the daily assessments (CD and beam intensity) and accuracy audit information at the interval for emissions reporting required under the applicable regulations or permits.
7.1.1 At a minimum, the daily assessments and accuracy audit information reporting must contain the following information:
a. Company name and address.
b. Identification and location of monitors in the CEMS.
c. Manufacturer and model number of each monitor in the CEMS.

# Procedure 7. Quality Assurance Requirements for Gaseous Ethylene Exide (ETO) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination

# 1.0 Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. Procedure 7 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and to evaluate the quality of data produced by any ethylene oxide (EtO) gas, CAS: 75-21-8, continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that is used for determining compliance with emission standards for EtO on a continuous basis as specified in an applicable permit or regulation.
1.1.1 This procedure specifies the minimum QA requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a delegated authority. If you are responsible for one or more CEMS used for EtO compliance monitoring you must meet these minimum requirements and you are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.
1.1.2 Data collected as a result of QA and quality control (QC) measures required in this procedure are to be submitted to the EPA or the delegated authority in accordance with the applicable regulation or permit. These data are to be used by both the delegated authority and you, as the CEMS operator, in assessing the effectiveness of the CEMS QC and QA procedures in the maintenance of acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.
1.2 Principle
1.2.1 The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form an
iterative control loop. When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure specifies the assessment procedures to evaluate response drift and accuracy. The procedures specified are based on Performance Specification 19 (PS-19) in appendix B to this part.

# Note 1 to section 1.0:
Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow you, as source owner or operator to develop the most effective and efficient QC system for your circumstances.

# 2.0 Definitions
See PS-19 in appendix B to this part for the primary definitions used in this Procedure.

# 3.0 QC Requirements
3.1 You, as a source owner or operator, must develop and implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures and/or manufacturer's information which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities:
(a) Calibration Drift (CD) checks of CEMS;
(b) CD determination and adjustment of CEMS;
(c) Routine and preventative maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory);
(d) Data recording, calculations, and reporting;
(e) Accuracy audit procedures for CEMS including reference method(s); and
(f) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.
3.2 These written procedures must be kept on site and available for inspection by the delegated authority. As described in section 5.4, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the current written procedures, or modify or replace the CEMS to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.

# 4.0 Daily Data Quality Requirements and Measurement Standardization Procedures
4.1 CD Assessment. An upscale gas, used to meet a requirement in this section must be a gas meeting the requirements in section 7.1 of PS-19 of appendix B to this part.
4.1.1 CD Requirement. Consistent with § 60.13(d) and with § 63.8(c) of this chapter, you, as source owners or operators of CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two levels, using a zero gas and high-level gas at least once daily (approximately every 24 hours). Perform the CD check in accordance with the procedure in the applicable performance specification (
e.g.,
section 11.3 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part). The daily zero- and high-level CD must not exceed two times the drift limits specified in the applicable performance specification (
e.g.,
section 13.2 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part.)
4.1.2 Recording Requirement for CD Corrective action. Corrective actions taken to bring a CEMS back in control after exceeding a CD limit must be recorded and reported with the associated CEMS data. Reporting of a corrective action must include the unadjusted concentration measured prior to resetting the calibration and the adjusted value after resetting the calibration to bring the CEMS back into control.
4.1.3 Dynamic Spiking Option for high-level CD. You have the option to conduct a daily dynamic spiking procedure found in section 11.5.8 of PS-19 of appendix B to this part in lieu of the daily high-level CD check. If this option is selected, the daily zero CD check is still required.
4.1.4 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive CD. Consistent with § 63.8(c)(7)(i)(A) of this chapter, an EtO CEMS is out of control if the zero or high-level CD exceeds two times the applicable CD specification in the applicable performance specification or in the relevant standard. When a CEMS is out of control, you as owner or operator of the affected source must take the necessary corrective actions and repeat the tests that caused the system to go out of control (in this case, the failed CD check) until the applicable performance requirements are met.
4.1.5 Additional Quality Assurance for Data Above Span. This procedure must be used when required by an applicable regulation and may be used when significant data above span are being collected. Furthermore, the terms of this procedure do not apply to the extent that alternate terms are otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit.
4.1.5.1 Any time the average measured concentration of EtO exceeds 200 percent of the span value for two consecutive one-hour averages, conduct the following 'above span' CEMS response check.
4.1.5.1.1 Within a period of 24 hours (before or after) of the 'above span' period, introduce a higher, 'above span' EtO reference gas standard to the CEMS. Use 'above span' reference gas that meets the requirements of section 7.0 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part and target a concentration level between 75 and 125 percent of the highest hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span or 5 ppmv whichever is greater.
4.1.5.1.2 Introduce the reference gas at the probe for extractive CEMS.
4.1.5.1.3 At no time may the 'above span' concentration exceed the analyzer full-scale range.
4.1.5.2 Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The 'above span' response check is successful if the value measured by the CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas.
4.1.5.3 If the 'above span' response check is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect at least one data point in an hour due to the response check duration, then determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour.
4.1.5.4 In the event that the 'above span' response check is not successful (
i.e.,
the CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the 'above span' response check for reporting based on the CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Eq. 7-1:
ER05AP24.025
4.2 Out of Control Period Duration for Daily Assessments. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour in which the owner or operator conducts a daily performance check (
e.g.,
calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this procedure. The end of the out-of-control period is the completion of daily assessment of the same type following corrective actions, which shows that the applicable performance requirements have been met.
4.3 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of- control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating compliance with an emissions limit nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.

# 5.0 Data Accuracy Assessment
You must audit your CEMS for the accuracy of EtO measurement on a regular basis at the frequency described in this section, unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Quarterly audits are performed at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits, to the extent practicable, shall occur no closer than 2 months apart. Annual audits are performed at least once every four consecutive calendar quarters.
5.1 Concentration Accuracy Auditing Requirements. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation or permit, you must audit the EtO measurement accuracy of each CEMS at least once each calendar quarter, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate). In that case, the audit must be performed as soon as is practicable in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Successive quarterly audits must, to the extent practicable, be performed no less than 2 months apart. The accuracy audits shall be conducted as follows:
5.1.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). A RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in sections 5.1.5 or 5.5 of this procedure. Perform the RATA as described in section 11.6 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part. If the EtO concentration measured by the RM during a RATA (in ppmv or other units of the standard) is less than or equal to 20 percent of the concentration equivalent to the applicable emission standard, you must perform a Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) or a Dynamic Spike Audit (DSA) for at least one subsequent (one of the following three) quarterly accuracy audits.
5.1.2 Quarterly Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). A quarterly RAA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct an RAA, follow the test procedures in section 11.6 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part, except that only three test runs are required. The difference between the mean of the RM values and the mean of the CEMS responses relative to the mean of the values (or alternatively the emission standard) is used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS. Calculate the RAA results as described in section 6.2. As an alternative to an RAA, a cylinder gas audit or a dynamic spiking audit may be conducted.
5.1.3 Cylinder Gas Audit. A quarterly CGA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three consecutive quarters. To perform a CGA, challenge the CEMS
with a zero-level and two upscale level audit gases of known concentrations within the following ranges:
Audit point
Audit range
1 (Mid-Level)
50 to 60% of span value.
2 (High-Level)
80 to 100% of span value.
5.1.3.1 Inject each of the three audit gases (zero and two upscale) three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases so that the entire measurement system is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.
5.1.3.2 Use EtO audit gases that meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part.
5.2.3.3 Calculate results as described in section 6.3.
5.1.4 Dynamic Spiking Audit. A quarterly DSA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession.
5.1.4.1 To conduct a DSA, you must challenge the entire EtO CEMS with a zero gas in accordance with the procedure in section 11.8 of PS-19 in appendix B of this part. You must also conduct the DS procedure as described in appendix A to PS-19 of appendix B to this part. You must conduct three spike injections with each of two upscale level audit gases. The upscale level gases must meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part and must be chosen to yield concentrations at the analyzer of 50 to 60 percent of span and 80 to 100 percent of span. Do not inject the same spike gas concentration twice in succession.
5.1.4.2 Calculate results as described in section 6.4. To determine CEMS accuracy, you must calculate the dynamic spiking error (DSE) for each of the two upscale audit gases using equation A5 in appendix A to PS-19 and equation 7-3 in section 6.4 of this Procedure.
5.1.5 Other Alternative Quarterly Audits. Other alternative audit procedures, as approved by the Administrator, may be used for three of four calendar quarters.
5.2 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the results of the RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA do not meet the applicable performance criteria in section 5.2.4, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the CEMS must pass a test of the same type that resulted in the out-of-control period to determine if the CEMS is operating within the specifications (
e.g.,
a RATA must always follow an out-of-control period resulting from a RATA).
5.2.1 If the audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, you must report both the results of the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.
5.2.2 Out-Of-Control Period Duration for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling for the failed RATA, RAA, CGA or DSA. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent successful audit.
5.2.3 CEMS Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of- control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.
5.2.4 Criteria for Excessive Quarterly and Yearly Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in the applicable regulation or permit, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:
5.2.4.1 For the RATA, the CEMS must meet the RA specifications in section 13.4 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part.
5.2.4.2 For the CGA, the accuracy must not exceed 10.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations.
5.2.4.3 For the RAA, the RA must not exceed 20.0 percent of the RMavg as calculated using equation 7-2 in section 6.2 of this procedure whether calculated in units of EtO concentration or in units of the emission standard. In cases where the RA is calculated on a concentration (ppbv) basis, if the average EtO concentration measured by the RM during the test is less than 75 percent of the EtO concentration equivalent to the applicable standard, you may substitute the equivalent emission standard value (in ppbw) in the denominator of equation 7-2 in the place of RM
avg
and the result of this alternative calculation of RA must not exceed 15.0 percent.
5.2.4.4 For DSA, the accuracy must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations or 20.0 percent of the applicable emission standard, whichever is greater.
5.3 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedures. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (
i.e.,
out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly or yearly audits) indicate that the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the QC procedures (see section 3.0) or modify or replace the CEMS.
5.4 Criteria for Optional QA Test Frequency. If all the quality criteria are met in sections 4 and 5 of this procedure, the CEMS is in-control.
5.5.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit, if the CEMS is in-control and if your source emits ≤75 percent of the EtO emission limit for each averaging period as specified in the relevant standard for eight consecutive quarters that include a minimum of two RATAs, you may revise your auditing procedures to use CGA, RAA or DSA each quarter for seven subsequent quarters following a RATA.
5.5.2 You must perform at least one RATA that meets the acceptance criteria every 2 years.
5.5.3 If you fail a RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA, then the audit schedule in section 5.2 must be followed until the audit results meet the criteria in section 5.3.4 to start requalifying for the optional QA test frequency in section 5.5.

# 6.0 Calculations for CEMS Data Accuracy
6.1 RATA RA Calculation. Follow equations 9 through 14 in section 12 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part to calculate the RA for the RATA. The RATA must be calculated either in units of the applicable emission standard or in concentration units (ppbv).
6.2 RAA Accuracy Calculation. Use equation 7-2 to calculate the accuracy for the RAA. The RA may be calculated in concentration units (ppmv) or in the units of the applicable emission standard.
ER05AP24.026
Where:
RA = Accuracy of the CEMS (percent)
MN
avg
= Average measured CEMS response during the audit in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
RM
avg
= Average reference method value in units of applicable standard or appropriate concentration.
6.3 CGA Accuracy Calculation. For each gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the audit gas value. For extractive CEMS, calculate the ME at each gas level using equation 3A in section 12.3 of PS-19 of appendix B to this part.
6.4 DSA Accuracy Calculation. DSA accuracy is calculated as a percent of span. To calculate the DSA accuracy for each upscale spike concentration, first calculate the DSE using equation A5 in appendix A of PS-19 in appendix B to this part. Then use equation 7-3 to calculate the average DSA accuracy for each upscale spike concentration. To calculate DSA accuracy at the zero level, use equation 3A in section 12.3 of PS-19 in appendix B to this part.
ER05AP24.027

# 7.0 Reporting Requirements
At the reporting interval specified in the applicable regulation or permit, report for each CEMS the quarterly and annual accuracy audit results from section 6 and the daily assessment results from section 4. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation or permit, include all data sheets, calculations, CEMS data records (

Each of these units is subject to the Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Steam Generators for Which Construction Commenced After August 17, 1971 (subpart D).
2.
Definitions
2.1 All definitions in subparts D and Da of part 60 apply to this provision except that:
24-hour period
means the period of time between 12:00 midnight and the following midnight.
Boiler operating day
means a 24-hour period during which any fossil is combusted in either the Unit 1 or Unit 2 steam generating unit and during which the provisions of § 60.43(e) are applicable.
CEMs
means continuous emission monitoring system.

3.
Compliance Provisions
3.1 If the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to comply with the 470 ng/J (1.1 lbs/MMBTU) of combined heat input emission limit under § 60.43(e), he shall notify the Regional Administrator, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Region 5 and the Director, of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) at least 30 days in advance of the date such election is to take effect, stating the date such operation is to commence. When the owner or operator elects to comply with this limit after one or more periods of reverting to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit of § 60.43(a)(2), as provided under 3.4, he shall notify the Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director of the (IEPA) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance of the date such election is to take effect.
3.2 Compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit under § 60.43(e) is determined on a continuous basis by performance testing using CEMs. Within 60 days after the initial operation of Units 1 and 2 subject to the combined emission limit in § 60.43(e), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test, as required by § 60.8, to determine compliance with the combined emission limit. This initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the thirtieth boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating days is completed within 60 days after initial operation subject to the 470 ng/J (1.1 lbs/MMBTU) combined emission limit. Following the initial performance test, a separate performance test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day Unit 1 and Unit 2 are subject to § 60.43(e), and a new 30 day average emission rate calculated.
3.2.1 Following the initial performance test, a new 30 day average emission rate is calculated for each boiler operating day the affected facility is subject to § 60.43(e). If the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to comply with § 60.43(e) after one or more periods of reverting to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit under § 60.43(a)(2), as provided under 3.4, the 30 day average emission rate under § 60.43(e) is calculated using emissions data of the current boiler operating day and data for the previous 29 boiler operating days when the affected facility was subject to § 60.43(e). Periods of operation of the affected facility under § 60.43(a)(2) are not considered boiler operating days. Emissions data collected during operation under § 60.43(a)(2) are not considered relative to 4.6 and emissions data are not included in calculations of emission under § 60.43(e).
3.2.2 When the affected facility is operated under the provisions of § 60.43(e), the Unit 1 DAFGDS bypass damper must be fully closed. The DAFGDS bypass may be opened only during periods of DAFGDS startup, shutdown, malfunction or testing as described under sections 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, and 4.8.2.
3.3 Compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit set forth in § 60.43(e) is based on the average combined hourly emission rate from Units 1 and 2 for 30 successive boiler operating days determined as follows:
EC15NO91.206
where:
n = the number of available hourly combined emission rate values in the 30 successive boiler operating day period where Unit 1 and Unit 2 are subject to § 60.43(e).
E30 = average emission rate for 30 successive boiler operating days where Unit 1 and Unit 2 are subject to § 60.43(e).
EC = the hourly combined emission rate from Units 1 and 2, in ng/J or lbs/MMBTU.
3.3.1 The average hourly combined emission rate for Units 1 and 2for each hour of operation of either Unit 1 or 2, or both, is determined as follows:
EC=[(E1) + (E2)]/[H1 + H2]
where:
EC = the hourly combined SO
2
emission rate, lbs/MMBTU, from Units 1 and 2 when Units 1 and 2 are subject to § 60.43(e).
E1 = the hourly SO
2
mass emission, lb/hr, from Unit 1 as determined from CEMs data using the calculation procedures in section 4 of this appendix.
E2 = the hourly SO
2
mass emission, lb/hr, from Unit 2 as determined from CEMs data using the calculation procedures in section 4 of this appendix.
H1 = the hourly heat input, MMBTU/HR to Unit 1 as determined in section 4 of this appendix.
H2 = the hourly heat input, MMBTU/HR, to Unit 2 as determined by section 4 of this appendix.
3.3.2 If data for any of the four hourly parameters (E1, E2, H1and H2, under 3.3.1 are unavailable during an hourly period, the combined emission rate (EC) is not calculated and the period is counted as missing data under 4.6.1., except as provided under 3.5. and 4.4.2.
3.4 After the date of initial operation subject to the combined emission limit, Units 1 and 2 shall remain subject to the combined emission limit and the owner or operator shall remain subject to the requirements of this Appendix until the initial performance test as required by 3.2 is completed and the owner or operator of the affected facility elects and provides notice to revert on a certain date to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit of § 60.43(a)(2) applicable separately at each unit. The Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director, of the IEPA shall be given written notification from CIPS as soon as possible of CIPs' decision to revert to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit of § 60.43(a)(2) separately at each unit, but no later than 10 days in advance of the date such election is to take effect.
3.5 Emission monitoring data for Unit 1 may be excluded from calculations of the 30 day rolling average only during the following times:
3.5.1 Periods of DAFGDS startup.
3.5.2 Periods of DAFGDS shutdown.
3.5.3 Periods of DAFGDS malfunction during system emergencies as defined in § 60.41a.
3.5.4 The first 250 hours per calendar year of DAFGDS malfunctions of Unit 1 DAFGDS provided that efforts are made to minimize emissions from Unit 1 in accordance with § 60.11(d), and if, after 16 hours but not more than 24 hours of DAFGDS malfunction, the owner or operator of the affected facility begins (following the customary loading procedures) loading into the Unit 1 coal bunker, coal with a potential SO
2
emission rate equal to or less than the emission rate of Unit 2 recorded at the beginning of the DAFGDS malfunction. Malfunction periods under 3.5.3 are not counted toward the 250 hour/yr limit under this section.
3.5.4.1 The malfunction exemption in 3.5.4 is limited to the first 250 hours per calendar year of DAFGDS malfunction.
3.5.4.2 For malfunctions of the DAFGDS after the 250 hours per calendar year limit (cumulative), other than those defined in 3.5.3, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall combust lower sulfur coal or use any other method to comply with the 470
ng/J (1.1 lbs/MMBTU) combined emission limit.
3.5.4.3 During the first 250 hours of DAFGDS malfunction per year or during periods of DAFGDS startup, or DAFGDS shutdown, CEMs emissions data from Unit 2 shall continue to be included in the daily calculation of the combined 30 day rolling average emission rate; that is, the load on Unit 1 is assumed to be zero (H1 and E1 = O; EC = E2/H2).
3.5.5-3.5.7 [Reserved]
3.6 The provision for excluding CEMs data from Unit 1 during the first 250 hours of DAFGDS malfunctions from combined hourly emissions calculations supersedes the provisions of § 60.11(d). However, the general purpose contained in § 60.11(d) (i.e., following good control practices to minimize air pollution emission during malfunctions) has not been superseded.

# 4. Continuous Emission Monitoring
4.1 The CEMs required under section 3.2 are operated and data are recorded for all periods of operation of the affected facility including periods of the DAFGDS startup, shutdown and malfunction except for CEMs breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustment.

For the Unit 1 DAFGDS stack, the span value of the sulfur dioxide analyzer shall be equivalent to 100 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential emissions of the fuel fired in parts per million sulfur dioxide. The span value for volumetric flow monitors shall be equivalent to 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly flow in standard cubic meters/minute (standard cubic feet per minute). The span value of the continuous moisture monitors, if required by 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.2.1, shall be equivalent to 100 percent by volume. The span value of the oxygen or carbon dioxide analyzers shall be equivalent to 25 percent by volume.
4.3.1-4.3.2 [Reserved]
4.4 The monitoring devices required in 4.2 shall be installed, calibrated, and maintained as follows:
4.4.1 Each volumetric flow rate monitoring device specified in 4.2 shall be installed at approximately the same location as the sulfur dioxide emission monitoring sample location.
4.4.2 Hourly steam production rate and hourly electrical power output monitoring devices for Unit 1 and Unit 2 shall be calibrated and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. The data from either of these devices may be used in the calculation of the combined emission rate in section 3.3.1, only when the hourly heat input for Unit 1 (H1) or the hourly heat input for Unit 2 (H2) cannot be determined from CEM data, and the hourly heat input to steam production or hourly heat input to electrical power output efficiency over a given segment of each boiler or generator operating range, respectively, varies by less than 5 percent within the specified operating range, or the efficiencies of the boiler/generator units differ by less than 5 percent. The hourly heat input for Unit 1 (H1) or the hourly heat input for Unit 2 (H2) in section 3.3.1 may also be calculated based on the fuel firing rates and fuel analysis.
4.4.3-4.4.5 [Reserved]
4.5 The hourly mass emissions from Unit 1 (E1) and Unit 2 (E2) and the hourly heat inputs from Unit 1 (H1) and Unit 2 (H2) used to determine the hourly combined emission rate for Units 1 and 2 (EC) in section 3.3.1 are calculated using CEM data for each respective stack as follows:
4.5.1 The hourly SO
2
mass emission from each respective stack is determined as follows:
E = (C) (F) (D) (K)
Where:
E = SO
2
mass emission from the respective stack in lb per hour
C = SO
2
concentration from the respective stack ppm
F = flue gas flow rate from the respective stack in scfm
D = density of SO
2
in lb per standard cubic feet
K = time conversion, 60 mins./hr
4.5.2 The hourly heat input from each respective stack is determined as follows:

c
)
where:

C = CO
2
or O
2
concentration from the respective stack as a decimal
F = flue gas flow rate from the respective stack in scfm
K = time conversion, 60 mins./hr
F
c
= fuel constant for the appropriate diluent in scf/MMBTU as per §§ 60.45(f) (4) and (5)
4.5.3 The hourly SO
2
mass emission for Unit 1 in pounds per hour (E1) is calculated as follows, when leakage or diversion of any DAFGDS inlet gas to the bypass stack occurs:
E1 = (EF) + (EB)
Where:
EF = Hourly SO
2
mass emission measured in DAFGDS stack, lb/hr, using the calculation in section 4.5.1.
EB = Hourly SO
2
mass emission measured in bypass stack, lb/hr, using the calculation in section 4.5.1.
Other than during conditions under 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, or 4.8.2, the DAFGDS bypass damper must be fully closed and any leakage will be indicated by the bypass stack volumetric flow and SO
2
measurements, and when no leakage through the bypass damper is indicated:
E1 = EF
4.5.4 The hourly heat input for Unit 1 in MMBTU per hour (H1) is calculated as follows, when leakage or diversion of any DAFGDS inlet gas to the bypass stack occurs:
H1 = (HF) + (HB)
where:
HF = Hourly heat input as determined from the DAFGDS stack CEMs, in MMBTU per hour, using the calculation in section 4.5.2
HB = Hourly heat input as determined from the DAFGDS bypass stack CEMs, in MMBTU per hour, using the calculation in section 4.5.2
4.6 For the CEMs required for Unit 1 and Unit 2, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall maintain and operate the CEMs and obtain combined emission data values (EC) for at least 75 percent of the boiler operting hours per day for at least 26 out of each 30 successive boiler operating days.
4.6.1 When hourly SO
2
emission data are not obtained by the CEMs because of CEMs breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks and zero and span adjustment, hourly emission data required by 4.6 are obtained by using Methods 6 or 6C and 3 or 3A, 6A, or 8 and 3, or by other alternative methods approved by the Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director, of the IEPA. Failure to obtain the minimum data requirements of 4.6 by CEMs, or by CEMs supplemented with alternative methods of this section, is a violation of performance testing requirements.
4.6.2 Independent of complying with the minimum data requirements of 4.6, all valid emissions data collected are used to calculate combined hourly emission rates (EC) and 30-day rolling average emission rates (E30) are calculated and used to judge compliance with 60.43(e).
4.7 For each continuous emission monitoring system, a quality control plan shall be prepared by CIPS and submitted to the Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director, of the IEPA. The plan is to be submitted to the Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director, of the IEPA 45 days before initiation of the initial performance test. At a minimum, the plan shall contain the following quality control elements:

2
CEMs and the Unit 2 SO
2
CEMs. The calibration drift specification of Performance Specification 3, appendix B shall be determined separately for each of the Unit 1 diluent CEMs and Unit 2 diluent CEMs.
4.8.2 The relative accuracy of the combined SO
2
emission rate for Unit 1 and Unit 2, as calculated from CEMs and volumetric flow data using the procedures in 3.3.1, 4.5.1, 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 shall be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the combined emission rate, as determined from testing conducted simultaneously on the DAFGDS stack, the
DAFGDS bypass stack and the Unit 2 stack using reference methods 2, 3, or 3A and 6 or 6C, or shall be no greater than 10 percent of the emission limit in § 60.43(e), whichever criteria is less stringent.

and diluent CEMs shall be subject to cylinder gas audits (OGA) in accordance with the quality assurance requirements of section 5.1.2 of appendix F with the exception that any SO
2
or diluent CEMs without any type of probe or sample line shall be exempt from the OGA requirements.

# 5. Recordkeeping Requirements

(a) Manufacturer and model, including catalyst if catalyst-equipped;
(b) Warranty details, including catalyst if catalyst-equipped; and
(c) Instructions for warranty claims.
Exhibit 2—Example Text covering 2.3.3(a), (b), and (c) of this appendix for catalysts:
“The combustor supplied with this heater is a
Brand Z, Long Life Combustor.
Consult the catalytic combustor warranty also supplied with this wood heater. Warranty claims should be addressed to:
Stove or Catalyst Manufacturer
Address
Phone #____________________________”
2.3.3.1 This section should also provide clear instructions on how to exercise the warranty (how to package parts for return shipment, etc.).
2.3.4 Fuel Selection
Owner's manuals must include:
(a) Instructions on acceptable fuels;
(b) Warning against inappropriate fuels; and
(c) How to determine seasoned wood compared to unseasoned wood, how to use moisture meters and other techniques and the importance of seasoned wood.
Exhibit 3—Example Text covering 2.3.4(a) and (b) of this appendix:
“This heater is designed to burn natural wood only. Higher efficiencies and lower emissions generally result when burning air dried seasoned hardwoods, as compared to softwoods or to green or freshly cut hardwoods. DO NOT BURN:
(1) Garbage;
(2) Lawn clippings or yard waste;
(3) Materials containing rubber, including tires;
(4) Materials containing plastic;
(5) Waste petroleum products, paints or paint thinners, or asphalt products;
(6) Materials containing asbestos;
(7) Construction or demolition debris;
(8) Railroad ties or pressure-treated wood;
(9) Manure or animal remains;
(10) Salt water driftwood or other previously salt water saturated materials;
(11) Unseasoned wood; or
(12) Paper products, cardboard, plywood, or particleboard. The prohibition against burning these materials does not prohibit the use of fire starters made from paper, cardboard, saw dust, wax and similar substances for the purpose of starting a fire in an affected wood heater.
Burning these materials may result in release of toxic fumes or render the heater ineffective and cause smoke.”

# 2.3.5 Achieving and Maintaining Catalyst Light-Off
Owner's manuals must describe in detail proper procedures for:
(a) Operation of catalyst bypass (stove specific);
(b) Achieving catalyst light-off from a cold start; and
(c) Achieving catalyst light-off when refueling.
2.3.5.1 No example text is supplied for describing operation of catalyst bypass mechanisms (Item 2.3.5(a) of this appendix) since these are typically stove-specific. Manufacturers must provide instructions specific to their model describing:
(1) Bypass position during startup;
(2) Bypass position during normal operation; and
(3) Bypass position during reloading.
Exhibit 4—Example Text for Item 2.3.5(b) of this appendix:
“The temperature in the stove and the gases entering the combustor must be raised to between
500
° to
700
°F for catalytic activity to be initiated. During the startup of a cold stove, a medium to high firing rate must be maintained for about
20
minutes. This ensures that the stove, catalyst, and fuel are all stabilized at proper operating temperatures. Even though it is possible to have gas temperatures reach
600
°F within
2
to
3
minutes after a fire is started, if the fire is allowed to die down immediately, it may go out or the combustor may stop working. Once the combustor starts working, heat generated in it by burning the smoke will keep it working.”
Exhibit 5—Example Text for Item 2.3.5(c) of this appendix:
“REFUELING: During the refueling and rekindling of a cool fire, or a fire that has burned down to the charcoal phase, operate the stove at a medium to high firing rate for about
10
minutes to ensure that the catalyst reaches approximately
600
°F.”

# 2.3.6 Catalyst Monitoring
Owner's manuals must include:
(a) Recommendation to visually inspect combustor at least three times during the heating season;
(b) Discussion on expected combustor temperatures for monitor-equipped units; and
(c) Suggested monitoring and inspection techniques and importance of ensuring catalyst is operating properly.
Exhibit 6—Example Text covering 2.3.6(a), (b) and (c) of this appendix:
“It is important to periodically monitor the operation of the catalytic combustor to ensure that it is functioning properly and to determine when it needs to be replaced. A non-functioning combustor will result in a loss of heating efficiency, and an increase in creosote and emissions. Following is a list of items that should be checked on a periodic basis:
• Combustors should be visually inspected at least three times during the heating season to determine if physical degradation has occurred. Actual removal of the combustor is not recommended unless more detailed inspection is warranted because of decreased performance. If any of these conditions exists, refer to Catalyst Troubleshooting section of this owner's manual.
• This catalytic (
or hybrid
) heater is equipped with a temperature probe to monitor catalyst operation. Properly functioning combustors typically maintain temperatures in excess of
500
°F, and often reach temperatures in excess of
1,000
°F. If catalyst temperatures are not in excess of
500
°F, refer to Catalyst Troubleshooting section of this owner's manual.
• You can get an indication of whether the catalyst is working by comparing the amount of smoke leaving the chimney when the smoke is going through the combustor and catalyst light-off has been achieved, to the amount of smoke leaving the chimney when the smoke is not routed through the combustor (bypass mode).
Step 1—Light stove in accordance with instructions in section 3.3.5.
Step 2—With smoke routed through the catalyst, go outside and observe the emissions leaving the chimney.
Step 3—Engage the bypass mechanism and again observe the emissions leaving the chimney.
Significantly more smoke will be seen when the exhaust is not routed through the combustor (bypass mode).”

# 2.3.7 Catalyst Troubleshooting
The owner's manual must provide clear descriptions of symptoms and remedies to common combustor problems and importance. It is recommended that photographs of catalyst peeling, plugging, thermal cracking, mechanical cracking, and masking be included in the manual to aid the consumer in identifying problems and to provide direction for corrective action.

# 2.3.8 Catalyst Replacement
The owner's manual must provide clear step-by-step instructions on how to remove and replace the catalytic combustor. The section should include diagrams and/or photographs.

# 2.3.9 Wood Heater Proper Operation and Maintenance
The owner's manual must provide clear descriptions of symptoms and remedies to common heater problems and importance. The owner's manual information must be adequate to enable consumers to achieve optimal emissions performance. Such information must be consistent with the operating instructions provided by the manufacturer to the approved test laboratory for operating the wood heater during certification testing, except for details of the certification test that would not be relevant to the user.
Owner's manual must include:
(a) Recommendations about building and maintaining a fire, especially for cold starts and the effectiveness of the top-down approach for starting fires;
(b) Instruction on proper use of air controls, including how to establish good combustion and how to ensure good combustion at the lowest burn rate for which the heater is warranted;
(c) Ash removal and disposal;
(d) Instruction replacement of gaskets, air tubes and other parts that are critical to the emissions performance of the unit, and other maintenance and repair instructions;
(e) Warning against overfiring; and
(f) Suggested monitoring and inspection techniques and importance of ensuring heater is operating properly, including ensuring visible emissions are minimized.
2.3.9.1 No example text is supplied for 2.3.9(a), (b), (d) and (f) of this appendix since these items are model specific. Manufacturers should provide detailed instructions on building and maintaining a fire including selection of fuel pieces, fuel quantity and stacking arrangement. Manufacturers should also provide instruction on proper air settings (both primary and secondary) for attaining minimum and maximum heat outputs and any special instructions for operating thermostatic controls. Step-by-step instructions on inspection and replacement of gaskets should also be included. Manufacturers should provide diagrams and/or photographs to assist the consumer. Gasket type and size should be specified.
Exhibit 7—Example Text for Item 2.3.9(c) of this appendix:
“Whenever ashes get
3
to
4
inches deep in your firebox or ash pan, and when the fire has burned down and cooled, remove excess ashes. Leave an ash bed approximately
1
inch deep on the firebox bottom to help maintain a hot charcoal bed.”
“Ashes should be placed in a metal container with a tight-fitting lid. The closed container of ashes should be placed on a noncombustible floor or on the ground, away from all combustible materials, pending final disposal. The ashes should be retained
in the closed container until all cinders have thoroughly cooled.”
Exhibit 8—Example Text covering Item 2.3.9(e) of this appendix:

# “DO NOT OVERFIRE THIS HEATER”
“Attempts to achieve heat output rates that exceed heater design specifications can result in permanent damage to the heater and to the catalytic combustor if so equipped.”

# 2.3.10 Wood Heater Installation, Including Stack Height, Heater Locations and Achieving Proper Draft
Owner's manual must include:
(a) Importance of proper draft;
(b) Conditions indicating inadequate draft;
(c) Conditions indicating excessive draft; and
(d) Guidance on proper stack height and proper heater locations,
i.e.,
not too close to neighbors or in valleys that would cause unhealthy air quality or nuisance conditions.
2.3.10.1 No example text is supplied for (d) because state, local and tribal requirements are model and location specific.
Exhibit 9—Example Text for Item (a):
“Draft is the force which moves air from the appliance up through the chimney. The amount of draft in your chimney depends on the length of the chimney, local geography, nearby obstructions and other factors. Too much draft may cause excessive temperatures in the appliance and may damage the catalytic combustor. Inadequate draft may cause backpuffing into the room and 'plugging' of the chimney or the catalyst
.”
Exhibit 10—Example Text for Item (b):
“Inadequate draft will cause the appliance to leak smoke into the room through appliance and chimney connector joints.”
Exhibit 11—Example Text for Item (c):
“An uncontrollable burn or excessive temperature indicates excessive draft.”

# 2.3.11 Efficiency
Owner's manual must include:
(a) Description of how the efficiency was determined,
e.g.,
use higher heating value of the fuel instead of lower heating value of the fuel, discuss sweet spot versus annual average versus annual fuel usage efficiency (AFUE);
(b) How operation and fuels affect efficiency,
e.g.,
seasoned wood versus high moisture fuel; operation at sweet spot versus low-burn rates; and
(c) How location affects the efficiency,
e.g.,
in main living area versus basement versus outdoors in sub-freezing temperatures.

# 2.3.12 Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Emissions and Monitors
Owner's manual must include:
(a) Discussion of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, including the CO data submitted in the certification application and expected variations for different operating conditions;

# Appendix K to Part 60—Determination of Volatile Organic Compound and Greenhouse Gas Leaks Using Optical Gas Imaging

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes.
Analytes
CAS No.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
No CAS number assigned.
Methane
74-82-8.
Ethane
74-84-0.
1.1.1 This protocol is applicable to the detection of VOCs, including hazardous air pollutants, and hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane.
1.2 Scope.
This protocol covers surveys of process equipment using Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras in sectors where the majority of constituents (
75 percent by volume) in the emissions streams have a response factor of at least 0.25 when compared to the response factor of propane and can be imaged by the equipment specified in Section 6.0. The specific component focus for the surveys is determined by the referencing
subpart, and can include, but is not limited to, valves, flanges, connectors, pumps, compressors, open-ended lines, pressure relief devices, and seal systems.
1.3 Applicability.
This protocol is applicable to facilities when specified in a referencing subpart. This protocol is intended to help determine the presence and location of leaks and is not currently applicable for use in direct emission rate measurements from sources.

# 2.0 Summary
2.1 A field portable infrared (IR) camera capable of imaging the target gas species is employed to survey process equipment and locate fugitive or leaking gas emissions. By restricting the amount of incoming thermal radiation to a small bandwidth corresponding to a region of interaction for the gas species of interest, the camera provides an image of an invisible gas to the camera operator. The camera type and manufacturer are not specified in this protocol, but the camera used must meet the specifications and performance criteria presented in Section 6. The keys to becoming proficient and maintaining leak detection proficiency using OGI cameras are proper camera operator training with sufficient field experience and conducting OGI surveys frequently throughout the year.

# 3.0 Definitions
Ambient air temperature
means the air temperature in the general location of the component being surveyed.
Camera configuration
means different ways of setting up an OGI camera that affect its detection capability. Examples of camera configurations that can be changed include the operating mode (
e.g.,
standard versus high sensitivity or enhanced), the lens, the portability (
e.g.,
handheld versus tripod), and the viewer (
e.g.,
OGI camera screen versus an external device like a tablet).
Delta temperature (delta-T or ΔT)
means the difference in temperature between the emitted process gas temperature and the surrounding background temperature. It is an acceptable practice in the field to assume that the emitted process gas temperature is equal to the ambient air temperature.
Dwell time
means the minimum amount of time required to survey a scene in order to provide adequate probability of leak detection. The dwell time is the active time the operator is looking for potential leaks and does not begin until the scene is in focus and steady.
Fugitive emission or leak
means any emissions observed using OGI from components regulated by the referencing subpart.
Imaging
is the process of producing a visual representation of emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
Monitoring survey
means imaging equipment with an OGI camera at one site on one day. Changing the site being surveyed or changing the day of imaging constitutes a new monitoring survey.
OGI camera operator
is someone who has completed the training required in Section 10 and passed the final survey test in Section 10.2.2.4.
Operating envelope
means the range of conditions (
i.e.,
wind speed, delta-T, viewing distance) within which a survey must be conducted to achieve the quality objective.
Optical gas imaging camera
means any field portable instrumentation that makes visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
Persistent leak
is any leak that is not intermittent in nature.
Referencing subpart
means a subpart in this part or in 40 CFR part 61, 62, 63, or 65 that requires the monitoring of regulated equipment for fugitive emissions or leaks, for which this protocol is referenced.
Response factor
means the OGI camera's response to a compound of interest relative to a reference compound at a concentration path-length of 10,000 parts per million-meter. Response factors are specific to the OGI camera model and can be obtained from peer reviewed articles or may be developed according to procedures specified in Annex 1 of this appendix K.
Senior OGI camera operator
is a camera operator who has conducted OGI surveys for a minimum of 1400 survey hours over the entirety of his/her career, including at least 40 survey hours in the past 12 months, and has completed or developed the classroom camera operator training as defined in Section 10.2.1. Previous 12 months means the 365-calendar days prior to the day of the activity that requires a senior OGI camera operator. The survey hours spent by the senior OGI camera operator performing comparative monitoring, either as part of initial training, retraining, or auditing other OGI camera operators, can be included when determining the senior OGI camera operator's experience both over his/her career and the past 12 months.
Simple scene
is defined as a scene that contains 10 or fewer components in the field of view.
Survey hour
is 60 minutes of observation conducted with an OGI camera. Survey hours do not include periods of time when the OGI camera operator is on a rest break. The 60 minutes do not need to be consecutive but are cumulative.

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Interferences from atmospheric conditions can impact the operator's ability to detect gas leaks. It is recommended that conditions involving steam, fog, mist, rain, solar
glint, high particulate matter concentrations, and extremely hot backgrounds are avoided for a survey of acceptable quality.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Site Hazards. Prior to applying this protocol in the field, the potential hazards at the survey site should be considered; advance coordination with the site is critical to understand the conditions and applicable safety policies. Users should be aware of safety concerns with viewing equipment through a camera while walking around an industrial setting. Users should also be aware of hazards related to eye strain, eye fatigue, and mental fatigue that may occur from prolonged periods of viewing equipment with an OGI camera. This protocol does not address all of the safety concerns associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this protocol to establish appropriate health and safety practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to implementing this protocol.
5.2 Hazardous Pollutants. Several of the compounds encountered over the course of implementing this protocol may be irritating or corrosive to tissues (
e.g.,
heptane) or may be toxic (
e.g.,
benzene, methyl alcohol, hydrogen sulfide). Nearly all are fire hazards. Chemical compounds in gaseous emissions should be determined from process knowledge of the source. Appropriate precautions can be found in reference documents, such as reference 13.1.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 An OGI camera model meeting the following specifications is required. This testing can be performed by the owner or operator, the camera manufacturer, or a third party. As required by Section 8.1, this testing must be performed initially, prior to using the OGI camera to conduct surveys. The determination in Section 6.1.1 must also be made any time the OGI camera will be used to survey components on equipment that was not previously included in monitoring surveys or whenever there are process changes that are expected to cause the gaseous emissions composition to change. The determination in Section 6.1.2 is only required initially and is required for each camera operating mode (
e.g.,
standard versus high sensitivity or enhanced).
6.1.1 The spectral range of infrared radiation measured by the OGI camera must overlap with a major absorption peak for the chemical target of interest, meaning the OGI camera must be sensitive with a response factor of at least 0.25 when compared to the response factor of propane for the majority of constituents (
75 percent by volume) of the expected gaseous emissions composition.
6.1.2 The OGI camera must be capable of detecting (or producing a detectable image of) methane emissions of 19 grams per hour (g/hr) and either n-butane emissions of 29 g/hr or propane emissions of 22 g/hr at a viewing distance of 2.0 meters and a delta-T of 5.0 °C in an environment of calm wind conditions around 1 meter per second (m/s) or less, unless the referencing subpart provides detection rates for a different compound(s) for that subpart.
6.2 The following items are needed for the initial specification confirmation of each OGI camera model, as required by Sections 6.1.2, and development of operating envelopes, as required by Section 8:
6.2.1 Methane test gas, chemically pure grade (99.5 percent) or higher.
6.2.2 n-Butane test gas or propane test gas, chemically pure grade (99 percent) or higher.
6.2.3 Release orifice,
1/4
inch (64 millimeter) inner diameter.
6.2.4 Mass flow controller or rotameter, capable of controlling the gas emission rate within an accuracy of 5 percent and traceable to the International System of Units (SI) through an unbroken chain of comparisons,
i.e.,
calibrations.
6.2.5 An industrial fan, capable of adjusting the sustained nominal wind speeds at regular intervals, with the ability to maintain a spatially uniform set speed within 20 percent of the target wind speed over the area of detection.
6.2.6 A meteorological station capable of providing representative data on ambient temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction at least once every hour. Follow the calibration and standardization requirements for meteorological measurements in EPA-454/B-08-002 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). The equipment must meet the following minimum specifications:
6.2.6.1 Ambient temperature readings accurate to at least 0.50 °C, with a resolution of 0.10 °C or less, and a minimum range of −20 to 70 °C.
6.2.6.2 Ambient pressure readings accurate to at least 5.0 millibar (mbar), with a resolution of 1.0 mbar or less, and a minimum range of 700 to 1100 mbar.
6.2.6.3 Wind speed readings accurate to at least 1.0 m/s, with a resolution of 0.10 m/s or less, and a minimum range of 0.10 to 20 m/s.
6.2.6.4 Wind direction readings accurate to at least 5 degrees, with a resolution of 1 degree or less.
6.2.6.5 Relative humidity readings accurate to at least 5.0 percent, with a resolution of 0.50 percent or less, and a minimum range of 10 to 90 percent noncondensing.
6.2.7 A temperature-controlled background large enough for viewing the emissions plume and capable of maintaining a uniform temperature. Uniform is defined as all points on the background deviating no
more than 1.0 °C from the average temperature of the background.
6.2.8 T-type probe thermocouple and readout, accurate to at 1.0 °C and traceable to the SI through an unbroken chain of comparisons,
i.e.,
calibrations, for measuring the test gas at or near the point of release.
6.2.9 T-type surface skin thermocouple and readout, accurate to at 1.0 °C and traceable to the SI through an unbroken chain of comparisons,
i.e.,
calibrations, for measuring the background immediately behind the test gas.
6.2.10 Device to measure the distance between the OGI camera and the release point (
e.g.,
tape measure, laser measurement tool), accurate to at least 2.0 centimeters (cm), with a resolution of at least 1.0 cm and traceable to the SI through an unbroken chain of comparisons,
i.e.,
calibrations.

# 7.0 Camera Calibration and Maintenance
7.1 The camera does not require routine calibration for purposes of gas leak detection but may require calibration if it is used for thermography (such as with ΔT determination features). Operators should follow manufacturer recommendations regarding maintenance and calibration, as appropriate.

# 8.0 Camera Specification Confirmation and Development of the Operating Envelope
8.1 Determine that the OGI camera meets the specifications in Section 6.1 prior to conducting surveys with the OGI camera. The determination in Section 6.1.1 must also be made any time the OGI camera will be used to survey components on equipment that was not previously included in monitoring surveys or whenever there are process changes that are expected to cause the gaseous emissions composition to change. The determination in Section 6.1.2 is only required initially. The results of this determination must be documented.
8.2 Field conditions such as the viewing distance to the component to be monitored, wind speed, ambient air temperature, and the background temperature all have the potential to impact the ability of the OGI camera operator to detect a leak. It is important that the OGI camera has been tested under the full range of expected field conditions in which the OGI camera will be used.
8.3 An operating envelope must be established for field use of the OGI camera. Imaging must not be performed when the conditions are outside of the developed operating envelope.
8.3.1 The operating envelope is specific to each model of OGI camera. The operating envelope can be developed by the owner or operator, the camera manufacturer, or a third party. The operating envelope must be developed initially, prior to conducting surveys with the OGI camera. The operating envelope may be updated or expanded at any time, following the procedures in this section.
8.3.2 The operating envelope must be confirmed for all potential configurations that could impact the detection limit, such as high sensitivity modes, available lenses, and handheld versus tripod. Conversely, separate operating envelopes may be developed for different configurations. If, in addition to or in lieu of the display on the camera itself, an external device (
e.g.,
laptop, tablet) is intended to be used to visualize the leak in the field, the operating envelope must be developed while using the external device. If the external device will not be used at all times, use of the external device is considered a separate configuration, and the operating envelope testing must be performed for both configurations.
8.4 Development of the operating envelope is to be performed using the test gas composition, flow rate, and orifice diameter described in Section 6.1.2, and must include the following variables:
8.4.1 Delta-T, regulated through the use of a temperature-controlled background encompassing approximately 50 percent of the field of view, with no potential for solar interference;
8.4.2 Viewing distance from the OGI camera to the component being imaged; and
8.4.3 Wind speed, controlled through the use of an industrial fan.
8.5 Determine the operating envelope using the following procedure:
8.5.1 Set up the methane test gas at a flow rate of 19 g/hr.
8.5.2 For this flow rate, the ability of the OGI camera to produce an observable image is challenged by ranges of the variables in Sections 8.4.1 through 8.4.3.
8.5.3 A panel of no less than 4 observers who have been trained using the OGI camera and who have a demonstrated capability of detecting gaseous leaks will observe the test gas release for each combination of delta-T, distance, and wind speed. A test emission is determined to be observed when at least 75 percent of the observers (
i.e.,
3 of the 4 observers) see the image.
8.5.4 Repeat the procedures in Sections 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 using either an n-butane test gas at a flow rate of 29 g/hr or a propane test gas at a flow rate of 22 g/hr.
8.5.5 The operating envelope to be used in the field for each OGI camera configuration tested is the more restrictive operating envelope developed between the two test gases.
8.5.6 Repeat the procedures in Sections 8.5.1-8.5.5 for each camera configuration that will be used to conduct surveys in the field.
8.6 The results of the testing to establish the operating envelope, including supporting videos, must be documented.
8.7 If an operating envelope has not been developed for an OGI camera model or an OGI camera operator wants to expand an operating envelope to account for site-specific conditions, a daily field check for maximum viewing distance must be completed prior to conducting a monitoring survey. This daily field check for maximum viewing distance does not need to be performed if an OGI suvey will be conducted within an operating envelope developed according to Sections 8.3 through 8.6.
8.7.1 A complete video record of the daily field check must be retained with the OGI survey records.
8.7.2 Each OGI camera operator who will conduct the monitoring survey must complete their own daily field check for maximum viewing distance using the OGI camera they will use to complete the monitoring survey. The daily field check must be conducted for each camera configuration that will be used during the monitoring survey.
8.7.3 The daily field check must be performed using the test gas composition and orifice diameter described in Section 6.1.2.
8.7.4 The daily field check must be conducted first for methane at a flow rate of 19 g/hr and then for either n-butane at a flow rate of 29 g/hr or propane at a flow rate of 22 g/hr. You must use a flow meter with a minimum accuracy of 5 percent of the mass rate. The daily field check for the two gases must occur at the same delta-T and wind speed conditions.
8.7.5 The OGI camera operator must determine the maximum distance from the gas release point at which the operator is able to visualize the gas release with the OGI camera. The OGI camera operator must document this distance, as well as the delta-T and the wind speed at the time of the daily field check and include this information with the OGI survey records.
8.7.6 If the daily check results in different maximum viewing distances for methane and n-butane/propane, the maximum viewing distance for the day for the OGI camera operator will be the shorter of the two maximum viewing distances.
8.7.7 If the delta-T in the field decreases below the delta-T that was recorded for the daily field check or if the wind speed increases above the wind speed recorded for the daily field check, the maximum viewing distance determination must be repeated for the new delta-T and wind speed conditions.
8.7.8 If multiple camera configurations will be used during the monitoring survey, the OGI camera operator may use the shortest maximum viewing distance of any configuration for all the configurations that will be used during the survey, or the OGI camera operator may use a different maximum viewing distance for each configuration that will be used during the survey.

# 9.0 Conducting the Monitoring Survey
Each site must have a monitoring plan that describes the procedures for conducting a monitoring survey. One monitoring plan can be used for multiple sites, as long as the plan contains the relevant information for each site. At a minimum, the monitoring plan must include the elements in this section.
9.1 The monitoring plan must include a description of a daily verification check to be performed prior to imaging to confirm that the camera is operating properly. This verification must consist of the following at a minimum:
9.1.1 Confirm that the OGI camera software loads successfully and does not display any error messages upon startup;
9.1.2 Confirm that the OGI camera focuses properly at the shortest and longest distances that will be imaged;
9.1.3 Confirm that the OGI camera produces a live IR image using a known emissions source, such as a butane lighter or a propane cylinder;
9.1.4 Confirm that the OGI camera can perform the delta-T check function as expected if this function will be used to meet the requirement in Section 9.2.3.
9.2 The monitoring plan must include a procedure for ensuring that the monitoring survey is performed only when conditions in the field are within the operating envelope established in Section 8 or the conditions established by the daily field check in Section 8.7. This procedure must include the following:
9.2.1 If the OGI camera operator will use an operating envelope established under Section 8, a description of how the viewing distance from the surveyed components, the wind speed, and the delta-T will be monitored and how the operator will deal with changes in site conditions during the survey to ensure that the monitoring survey is conducted within the limits of the operating envelope;
9.2.2 If the OGI camera operator performs a daily field check according to Section 8.7, a description of how the OGI camera operator will monitor viewing distance to ensure the viewing distance is less than the daily maximum viewing distance and how the OGI camera operator will monitor the delta-T and wind speed to ensure the delta-T remains above and the wind speed remains below those that occurred during the daily field check;
9.2.3 Description of how the operator will ensure an adequate delta-T is present in order to view potential gaseous emissions,
e.g.,
using a delta-T check function built into the features of the OGI camera or using a background temperature reading in the OGI camera field of view;
9.2.4 Description of how the operator will recognize the presence of and deal with potential interferences and/or adverse monitoring conditions, such as steam, fog, mist, rain, solar glint, extremely high concentrations of particulate matter, and hot temperature backgrounds.
9.3 The site must conduct monitoring surveys using a methodology that ensures that all the components regulated by the referencing subpart within the unit or area are monitored. This must be achieved using one of the following three approaches or a combination of these approaches. The approach(es) chosen and how the approach(es) will be implemented must be described in the monitoring plan.
9.3.1 Use of a route map or a map with designated observation locations. The map must be included as part of the monitoring plan, with a predetermined sequence of process unit monitoring (such as directional arrows along the monitoring path) depicted or designated observation locations clearly marked.
9.3.2 Use of visual cues. The facility must develop visual cues (
e.g.,
tags, streamers, or color-coded pipes) to ensure that all components regulated by the referencing subpart were monitored. The monitoring plan must describe what visual cue method is used and how it will be used to ensure all components are monitored during the survey.
9.3.3 Use of global positioning system (GPS) route tracing. The facility must document the path taken during the survey by capturing GPS coordinates along the survey path, along with date and time stamps. These locations should be identified by latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees to an accuracy and precision of at least five decimals of a degree using the North American Datum of 1983. GPS coordinates must be recorded frequently enough to document that all components regulated by the referencing subpart were monitored. The monitoring plan must describe how often GPS coordinates will be recorded and how the route tracing will ensure all components regulated by the referencing subpart are monitored.
9.4 The monitoring plan must include a procedure that describes how components will be viewed with the OGI camera.
9.4.1 Components must be imaged from at least two different angles.
9.4.2 For a simple scene, which is a scene that contains 10 or fewer components in the field of view, the OGI camera operator must have a minimum dwell time on each angle of 10 seconds per scene before changing the angle, distance, or focus and dwelling again.
9.4.3 For scenes other than simple scenes, the operator must divide the scene into manageable subsections. The OGI camera operator must have a minimum dwell time of 2 seconds per component in the field of view for each angle.
9.4.4 It may be necessary to reduce distance or change angles in order to reduce the number of components in the field of view. An OGI camera operator may choose to reduce the distance from components in order to create simple scenes.
9.4.5 The required dwell times stated in this section are minimum dwell times. Additional dwell time may be necessary to assess whether each monitored component is leaking or not leaking. OGI camera operators should use training and knowledge of environmental conditions and component configurations to increase dwell time where appropriate.
9.4.6 The dwell time is the time that the OGI camera is in a particular operating mode and the scene is in focus and held steady such that an OGI camera operator is able to monitor for leaks. Changing OGI camera operating modes or viewing angles requires the OGI camera operator to restart the dwell time.
9.4.7 The procedure must discuss changes, if necessary, to the imaging mode of the OGI camera that are appropriate to ensure that leaks from all components regulated by the referencing subpart can be imaged.
9.5 The monitoring plan must include a plan for avoiding camera operator fatigue, as physical, mental, and eye fatigue are concerns with continuous field operation of OGI cameras. The OGI camera operator should not survey continuously for a period of more than 30 minutes without taking a rest break. Taking a rest break between surveys of process units may satisfy this requirement; however, for process units or complex scenes requiring continuous survey periods of more than 30 minutes, the operator must take a break of at least 5 minutes after every 30 minutes of surveying. Operators can complete tasks related to the monitoring survey, such as documentation, during the 5-minute rest break, so long as the operator is not actively imaging components.
Note:
If continuous surveying is desired for extended time periods, two camera operators can alternate between surveying and taking breaks.
9.6 The monitoring plan must include a procedure for documenting monitoring surveys. The information documented must include:
9.6.1 The name of the facility, date, and approximate start and end times for each monitoring survey.
9.6.2 The weather conditions, including ambient temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and sky conditions at the start and end of each monitoring survey. For monitoring surveys conducted for more than four hours, record the weather conditions every two hours.
9.7 The site must have a procedure for documenting fugitive emissions or leaks found during the monitoring survey.
9.7.1 If a leak is found, capture either a short video clip or photograph of the component associated with the leak. If the leak is not immediately repaired, the leaking component must be tagged for repair. The date, time, location of the leak, and an identification of the component associated with the leak must be recorded and stored with the OGI survey records. A full recording of the survey will suffice for this requirement.
9.7.2 If no emissions are found, no recorded footage is required to demonstrate that the component was not leaking.
9.8 The monitoring plan must include a quality assurance (QA) verification video for each OGI operator at least once each monitoring day. The QA verification video must be a minimum of 5 minutes long and document the procedures the operator uses to survey (
e.g.,
dwell times, angles, distances, backgrounds) and the camera configuration.
9.9 The monitoring plan must describe the process that will be used to ensure the validity of the monitoring data as detailed in Section 11.

# 10.0 Camera Operator Training
10.1 The facility or company performing the OGI surveys must have a training plan which ensures and monitors the proficiency of the camera operators. Training should include classroom instruction and field training on the OGI camera and external devices, monitoring techniques, best practices, process knowledge, and other regulatory requirements related to leak detection that are relevant to the facility's OGI monitoring efforts. If the facility does not perform its own OGI monitoring, the facility must ensure that the training plan for the company performing the OGI surveys adheres to this requirement.
10.2 Prior to conducting monitoring surveys, camera operators must complete initial training and demonstrate proficiency with the OGI camera and any external devices to be utilized for detecting a potential leak.
10.2.1 At a minimum, the training plan must include the following classroom training elements as part of the initial training. Classroom training can be conducted at a physical location, remotely, or online.
10.2.1.1 Key fundamental concepts of the OGI camera technology, such as the types of images the camera is capable of visualizing and the technology basis (theory) behind this capability.
10.2.1.2 Parameters that can affect image detection (
e.g.,
wind speed, temperature, distance, background, and potential interferences).
10.2.1.3 Description of the components to be surveyed and example imagery of the various types of leaks that can be expected.
10.2.1.4 Operating and maintenance instructions for the OGI camera used at the facility.
10.2.1.5 Procedures for performing the monitoring survey according to the monitoring plan, including the daily verification check; how to ensure the monitoring survey is performed only when the conditions in the field are within the established operating envelope; the number of angles a component or set of components should be imaged from; the minimum dwell time for a scene before changing the angle, distance, and/or focus; how to improve the background visualization; the procedure for ensuring that all components regulated by the referencing subpart are visualized; and required rest breaks.
10.2.1.6 Recordkeeping requirements.
10.2.1.7 Common mistakes and best practices.
10.2.1.8 Discussion of the regulatory requirements related to leak detection that are relevant to the facility's OGI monitoring efforts.
10.2.2 At a minimum, the training plan must include the following field training elements as part of the initial training:
10.2.2.1 A minimum of 3 survey hours with OGI where trainees observe the techniques and methods of a senior OGI camera operator (see definition in Section 3.0) who reinforces the classroom training elements.
10.2.2.2 A minimum of 12 survey hours with OGI where the trainee performs the initial OGI survey with a senior OGI camera operator verifying the results by conducting a side-by-side comparative survey and providing instruction/correction where necessary.
10.2.2.3 A minimum of 15 survey hours with OGI where the trainee performs monitoring surveys independently with a senior OGI camera operator trainer present and the senior OGI camera operator providing oversight and instruction/correction to the trainee where necessary.
10.2.2.4 A final monitoring survey test where the trainee conducts an OGI survey of at least 2 suvey hours and a senior OGI camera operator follows behind with a second camera to confirm the OGI survey results. If there are 10 or more leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the trainee must achieve no more than 10 percent missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator to be considered authorized for independent survey execution. If there are less than 10 leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the trainee must achieve zero missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator to be considered authorized for independent survey execution.
10.2.2.5 If the trainee doesn't pass the monitoring survey test in Section 10.2.2.4, the senior OGI operator must discuss the reasons for the failure with the trainee and provide instruction/correction on improving the trainee's performance. Following the discussion with the senior OGI operator, the trainee may repeat the test in Section 10.2.2.4.
10.3 All OGI camera operators must attend a biennial classroom training refresher. This refresher can be shorter in duration than the initial classroom training but must cover all the salient points necessary to operate the camera (
e.g.,
performing surveys according to the monitoring plan, best practices, discussion of lessons learned). Refresher training can be conducted at a physical location, remotely, or online.
10.4 Performance audits for all OGI camera operators must occur on a semiannual basis with at least three months between two consecutive audits. Performance audits must be conducted according to one of the following procedures:
10.4.1 Performance audit by comparative monitoring. Comparative monitoring in near real-time is where a senior OGI camera operator reviews the performance of the employee being audited by performing an independent monitoring survey.
10.4.1.1 Following a survey conducted by the camera operator being audited, the senior OGI camera operator will conduct a survey of at least 2 survey hours in the same area to ensure that no persistent leaks were missed.
10.4.1.2 If there are 10 or more leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the camera operator being audited must achieve no more than 10 percent missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator. If there are less than 10 leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the camera operator being audited must achieve zero missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator. If the camera operator being audited does not achieve this benchmark, then the camera operator being audited will need to be retrained as outlined in Section 10.4.3.
10.4.2 Performance audit by video review. The camera operator being audited must submit unedited and uncut video footage of their OGI survey technique to a senior OGI camera operator for review.
10.4.2.1 The videos must contain at least 2 survey hours of survey footage. If a single monitoring survey is less than 2 survey hours, footage from multiple monitoring surveys may be submitted; however, all videos necessary to cover a 2-hour period must be recorded and submitted for review. The senior OGI camera operator will review the survey technique of the camera operator being audited, as well as look for any missed leaks.
10.4.2.2 If the senior OGI camera operator finds that the survey techniques during the video review do not match those described in the monitoring plan, then the camera operator being audited will need to be retrained as outlined in Section 10.4.3. Additionally, if there are 10 or more leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the camera operator being audited must achieve no more than 10 percent missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator. If there are less than 10 leaks identified by the senior OGI operator, the camera operator being audited must achieve zero missed persistent leaks relative to the senior OGI camera operator. If the camera operator being audited does not achieve this benchmark, then the camera operator being audited will need to be retrained as outlined in Section 10.4.3.
10.4.3 At a minimum, retraining must consist of the following elements:
10.4.3.1 A discussion of the reasons for the failure with the OGI operator being audited and techniques to improve performance.
10.4.3.2 A minimum of 8 survey hours with OGI where the trainee performs the initial OGI survey with a senior OGI camera operator verifying the results by conducting a side-by-side comparative survey and providing instruction/correction where necessary.
10.4.3.3 A minimum of 8 survey hours with OGI where the trainee performs the survey independently with the senior OGI camera operator trainer present and the senior OGI camera operator provides oversight and instruction/correction to the trainee where necessary.
10.4.3.4 The audited camera operator must perform a final monitoring survey test as described in Section 10.2.2.4 and meet the requirements in Section 10.2.2.4 to be recertified.
10.4.4 If an OGI operator requires retraining in two consecutive semiannual audits, the OGI operator must repeat the initial training requirements in Section 10.2.
10.4.5 If a camera operator is not scheduled to perform an OGI survey during a semiannual period, then the audit must occur with the next scheduled monitoring survey.
10.5 If an OGI camera operator has not conducted a monitoring survey in over 12 months, then the operator must complete the retraining requirements in Section 10.4.3 prior to conducting surveys. If an OGI camera operator has not conducted a monitoring survey in over 24 months, then the operator must complete the biennial classroom training in Section 10.3 and complete the retraining requirements in Section 10.4.3 prior to conducting surveys.
10.6 Previous experience with OGI camera operation can be substituted for some of the initial training requirements in Section 10.2 as outlined in this Section 10.6.1 and 10.6.2.
10.6.1 OGI camera operators with previous classroom training (at a physical location, remotely, or online) that included a majority of the elements listed in Section 10.2.1 do not need to complete the initial classroom training as described in Section 10.2.1, but if the date of training is more than two years before March 8, 2024, the biennial classroom training in Section 10.3 must be completed in lieu of the initial classroom training in Section 10.2.1.
10.6.2 OGI camera operators who have 40 survey hours of experience over the 12 calendar months prior to March 8, 2024 may substitute the retraining requirements in Section 10.4.3, including the final monitoring survey test, for the initial field training requirements in Section 10.2.2.

# 11.0 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
11.1 As part of the facility's monitoring plan, the facility must have a process which ensures the validity of the monitoring data. Examples may include routine review and sign-off of the monitoring data by the camera operator's supervisor, periodic comparative monitoring using a different camera operator as part of a continuing training verification plan described in Section 10, or other due diligence procedures.
11.2 For each monitoring day, the daily OGI camera verification must be performed as described in Section 9.1. Additionally, the daily QA verification video for each operator must be recorded as described in Section 9.8 for each operator for each monitoring day.

# 14.0 Annexes
14.1 Annex 1—Development of Response Factors for OGI Cameras.
14.1.1 Introduction.
The purpose of this annex 14.1 is to outline the protocol for the development of response factors (RFs) for optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras. As defined in Section 3.0 of this appendix K, a response factor is the OGI camera's response to a compound of interest relative to a reference compound at a concentration path-length of 10,000 parts per million-meter (ppm-m).
14.1.1.1 Nomenclature.
14.1.1.1.1 The definitions listed in Section 3.0 of this appendix K apply to this annex 14.1.
14.1.1.1.2 Infrared (IR) radiance pixel area. The IR radiance pixel area is the average of a set of pixel IR radiance for an instantaneous measurement. There will be three different areas representing the reference cell, gas cell, and the raw blackbody surface. The pixel count for each area must be at a minimum of 0.5 percent of the total pixels of the detector. The pixel locations selected for an area must not change throughout the test.
14.1.1.1.3 Measurement data set. Measurement data set is the number of time independent IR radiance pixel areas that are taken. The minimum number of measured IR radiance pixel area within a data set is 1,000 data points. The number of measured IR radiance pixel area within a measurement data set should stay consistent throughout the test.
14.1.1.1.4 Reference Compound. The reference compound is the compound that provides the reference for determination of the RF with the compound of interest. The reference compound for this annex 14.1 is propane, unless otherwise specified in a referencing subpart.
14.1.2 Applicability and Analytical Principle.
14.1.2.1 Applicability. This annex 14.1 applies to the determination of compound specific RFs through empirical testing for use with this appendix K. This annex 14.1 does not apply to other applications of OGI cameras or other instruments. This annex 14.1 does not limit the use of other peer reviewed and published techniques and RFs per Section 3.0 of this appendix K.
14.1.2.2 Analytical Principle. OGI cameras work by providing an image or video with each pixel representing a measurement of the IR radiation. OGI cameras limit measurement to specific wavelengths of IR through the choice of the detector and generally through the addition of a bandpass filter. Limiting the measurement to specific wavelengths of IR allows the OGI camera to focus on a specific region of interest in order to increase the detection capabilities of particular compounds of interest. The combination of detector and bandpass filter, in addition to limiting the region of interest, will allow varying amounts of IR over the specific wavelength region.
14.1.3.0 Equipment and Supplies.
14.1.3.1 Section 6.0 of this appendix K lists equipment and supplies that may be used in this annex 14.1.
14.1.3.2 Blackbody Source. A sufficiently large blackbody source capable of maintaining high emissivity, as well as temperature stability and homogeneity.
14.1.3.2.1 The blackbody must have an emissivity of 0.95 or higher in the IR region of interest.
14.1.3.2.2 The source emissive area must have a uniform temperature, where uniform is defined as all points on the emissive area deviating no more than 0.10 degree Celsius ( °C) from the average temperature of the emissive area. The temperature readings must be accurate to at least 0.10 °C. The blackbody must be able to maintain its temperature within 0.10 °C.
14.1.3.2.3 The source's surface area must be large enough to allow the OGI camera to take IR measurements of two gas cells and allow for the proper measurement of IR radiance through the gas and reference cell and IR radiance of the surface itself.
14.1.3.3 Test gas for each compound of interest, used for determining the RF. The concentration of the gas in the cylinder must be vendor certified to ± 5.0 percent of the cylinder tag value and be in a balance of nitrogen. The concentration of the gas must be such that the gas cell concentration is 10,000 ppm-m with less than 2.0 percent error. Alternatively, the gas standard may be produced with dilution per Method 205 of 40 CFR part 51 Appendix M with the exception that the mid-supply gas may be vendor certified to ± 5.0 percent of the cylinder tag value.
14.1.3.4 Gas Cell. A windowed gas cell that is leak tight and has the ability to flow gas through the cell. The size of the cell should be such to allow for 10,000 ppm-m to be viewed by the OGI camera with less than 2.0 percent error. The windows should be 99 percent transmissive in the IR region of interest and deviate no more than 0.50 percent transmission over than region of interest. The cell must have associated temperature, flow, and pressure measurements.
14.1.3.5 Reference Compound Gas Standard. Propane gas standard, unless a referencing subpart specifies otherwise, used as the reference for determination of the RF. The concentration of the gas in the cylinder must be vendor certified to ± 2.0 percent of the cylinder tag value and be in a balance of nitrogen. The concentration of the gas must be such that the gas cell concentration is 10,000. ppm-m with less than 2.0 percent error.
14.1.3.6 Reference Cell. A gas cell for the reference compound gas standard which meets all of the requirements in Section 14.1.3.4 of this annex 14.1.
14.1.3.7 Zero Gas. A 99.99 percent pure diatomic gas, typically nitrogen, that has no IR response from the OGI camera, used to assess the detection level of the system and baseline response of the gas cells.
14.1.3.8 OGI Camera is the specific OGI camera that is being tested. RFs must be determined for each IR detector and bandpass filter combination. The OGI camera must have the ability to output the raw IR radiance at the pixel level.
14.1.3.8.1 The combination of IR detector and bandpass filter may be consistent over
several models such that the developed RFs may be applicable to more than one model of OGI camera.
14.1.3.8.2 If the OGI camera model has exchangeable bandpass filters, more than one set of RFs may be needed for the OGI camera model to account for the differences between filters.
4.0 Pre-Test Preparation and Evaluations.
14.1.4.1 Room Preparation. The room where testing will occur must be prepared by removing all extraneous thermal sources, or at a minimum, isolating extraneous thermal sources with IR absorptive material before any testing is conducted.
14.1.4.2 Reference and Gas Cell Preparation. Perform leak checks on both the reference and gas cells. Ensure that the temperatures of the cells are within 0.10 °C and that the pressure measurements are working.
14.1.4.3 OGI Camera Preparation. Ensure the OGI camera is operating to manufacturer specifications and able to record in raw IR radiance on a per pixel basis.
14.1.4.4 Blackbody Preparation and Verification. Prepare the blackbody by setting the temperature 10.0 °C different than the gas and reference cell temperatures. Ensure the blackbody is working correctly by verifying the IR radiance homogeneity of the blackbody surface with the OGI camera.
14.1.4.5 System Preparation. Ensure the alignment of the cells, blackbody source, and OGI camera are all fixed in place and cannot deviate from their position during the testing.
14.1.4.5.1 The reference and gas cell windows must overlap the blackbody surface in a manner that provides sufficient viewing of the blackbody surface from the vantage point of the camera.
14.1.4.5.2 The reference and gas cells should be placed sufficiently away from the blackbody surface. The distance must be far enough to ensure that the reference and gas cells are not heated or cooled by the blackbody surface.
14.1.4.5.3 The OGI camera should be located at a distance such that the field of view allows the requirements of the IR radiance pixel area to be met. Additionally, the distance must be such that it does not nominally change the path length of the cell.
14.1.4.5.4 For both the reference cell and the gas cell, the depth of the cell and concentration of the gas must result in a concentration 10,000. ppm-m with less than 2 percent error.
14.1.4.6 Initial System Assessment.
14.1.4.6.1 Flow zero gas through both the reference and gas cell, and ensure the gas cell temperatures are within 0.1 °C.
14.1.4.6.2 Record the temperatures of the gas and reference cells, the blackbody surface, and the room. Record the pressures in the reference and gas cells. Record the flowrates into the reference and gas cells.
14.1.4.6.3 Measure the IR radiance of the reference cell, the gas cell, and the blackbody surface for a measurement data set. For the IR radiance pixel area for the blackbody, the blackbody through the reference cell, and the blackbody through the gas cell, calculate the average, the standard deviation, and the 99 percent confidence level for the measurement data set.
14.1.4.6.4 The detection limit for the system will be the highest 99 percent confidence level of the IR radiance measurement of the blackbody, blackbody through the reference cell, or blackbody through the gas cell.
14.1.4.6.5 If the standard deviation of the reference cell's and the gas cell's average pixel areas of interest have a difference greater than 5 percent, take corrective actions and repeat the assessment.
14.1.5.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure.
14.1.5.1 Flow reference compound gas through the reference cell and test gas for the compound of interest through the gas cell and ensure the cell temperatures are within 0.10 °C.
14.1.5.2 Record the temperatures of the gas and reference cells, the blackbody surface, and the room temperature. Record the pressures in the reference and gas cells. Record the flowrates into the reference and gas cells. If using Method 205 of 40 CFR part 51 Appendix M for dilution of the test gas for the compound of interest, record the appropriate parameters required by the method.
14.1.5.3 Adjust the gas flow if the pressure in the cell is not within an inch of water of ambient pressure. Ensure cell temperatures are within 0.10 °C of the room temperature.
14.1.5.4 Measure the IR radiance of the reference cell, the gas cell, and the blackbody surface for a measurement data set. Calculate the average of the IR radiance pixel area and the standard deviation of the IR radiance pixel area for the reference cell, gas cell, and the blackbody surface for the measurement data set.
14.1.6.0 Post-test Requirements.
14.1.6.1 Post-test Assessment.
14.1.6.1.1 Flow zero gas through both the reference and gas cells and ensure the cell temperatures are within 0.1 °C.
14.1.6.1.2 Record the temperatures of the gas and reference cells, the blackbody surface, and the room. Record the pressures in the reference and gas cells. Record the flowrates into the reference and gas cells.
14.1.6.1.3 Measure the IR radiance of the reference cell, the gas cell, and the blackbody surface for a measurement data set. Calculate the average of the IR radiance pixel area, the standard deviation of the IR radiance pixel area, and the 99 percent confidence level of the IR radiance pixel area for the reference cell, gas cell, and the
blackbody surface for the measurement data set.
14.1.6.1.4 If the average and standard deviation of the reference cell's and the gas cell's average pixel areas of interest have a difference greater than 5.0 percent between the pre-test and post-test assessment, then the test is invalid. Take corrective actions and repeat the test.
14.1.6.2 When the average of the IR radiance pixel areas for the compound of interest over the measurement set as determined in Section 14.1.5.4 of this annex 14.1 is greater than the detection limit established in Section 14.1.4.6.4 of this annex 14.1, calculate the RF for the compound of interest as follows:
RF = response factor of the compound of interest (unitless).

14.1.7.0 Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements.
14.1.7.1 Records, including all raw data and calculations, must be kept for a period of 5 years, unless otherwise noted below or otherwise specified in a referencing subpart. Records may be retained in hard copy or electronic form.
14.1.7.2 All records supporting the development of RFs under this annex 14.1 must be maintained in a manner that is easily accessible to all OGI camera operators using the RFs. While the owner or operator does not need to have a copy of these records onsite if another entity performed the development of the RFs, the owner or operator must:
(1) Ensure that the RF development was performed in accordance with the requirements of this annex,
(2) Ensure easy access to these records, and
(3) Make the records available for review if requested by the Administrator.
These records must be retained for the entire period that the OGI camera is used to conduct surveys at the site plus 5 years. Previous versions of these records that are no longer relevant because they have been replaced by newer versions or because the specific OGI camera model is no longer being used to conduct surveys at the site must be retained for a period of 5 years past the date on which the records are replaced or the OGI camera model is no longer being used to conduct surveys at the site.
