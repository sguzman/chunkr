§ 225.1
Promulgation.
This part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by natural gas companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein.
[Order 617, 65 FR 48160, Aug. 7, 2000]
§ 225.2
General instructions.
(a)
Scope of this part.
(1) The regulations in this part must apply to all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the natural gas company. See item 40 of the schedule for those records that come into possession of the natural gas company in connection with the acquisition of property, such as purchases, consolidation, merger, etc.
(2) The regulations in this part should not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements, or for preservation of records for periods longer than those prescribed in this part.
(3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.
(4) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the natural gas company:
Provided, however,
That records which are used in lieu of those listed shall be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes. And,
provided further,
That retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, shall conform to the principles embodied herein.
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Records Retention Schedule, the Commission may, upon the request of the company, authorize a shorter period of retention for any record listed therein upon a showing by the company that preservation of such record for a longer period is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
(b)
Designation of supervisory official.
Each natural gas company subject to the regulations in this part shall designate one or more persons with official responsibility to supervise the natural gas company's program for preservation and the authorized destruction of its records.
(c)
Protection and storage of records.
The natural gas company shall provide reasonable protection for records subject to the regulations in this part from damage by fires, floods, and other hazards and, in the selection of storage
spaces, safeguard the records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.
(d)
Record storage media.
Each natural gas company has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions.
(1) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 225.3 unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.
(2) Each natural gas company is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of and ready access to data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.
(3) Each transfer of data from one media to another must be verified for accuracy and documented. Software and hardware required to produce readable records must be retained for the same period the media format is used.
(e)
Destruction of records.
At the expiration of the records retention period, natural gas companies may use any appropriate method to destroy records.
(f)
Premature destruction or loss of records.
When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of the destruction.
(g)
Schedule of records and periods of retention.
(1) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.
(2) Records related to additions, retirements, and betterments thereto must be retained until the Commission has determined the actual legitimate original cost of the facilities.
(h)
Retention periods designated “Destroy at option”.
“Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory actions or directives.
(i)
Records of services performed by associated companies.
The natural gas companies must assure the availability of records of services performed by associated or affiliated companies with supporting cost information for the periods indicated in § 225.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of the transaction, the amounts involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.
(j)
Index of records.
Natural gas companies must arrange, file, and index records so they may be readily identified and made available to Commission representatives.
(k)
Rate case.
Notwithstanding the minimum retention periods provided in these regulations, if a natural gas company intends to reflect costs in a current, pending, or future rate case, or if a natural gas company has abandoned or retired a plant subsequent to the test period of its last rate case, it must retain all relevant records.
(l)
Pending complaint litigation or governmental proceeding.
Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if a natural gas company is involved in pending litigation, complaint procedures, proceedings remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all relevant records.
(m)
Life or mortality study data.
Life or mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired whichever is longer.

(b)
Subchapter H definitions.
For purposes of this part:
(1)
NGPA
means the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.
(2)
Surface location
means the point on the Earth's surface from which drilling of a well is commenced except that in the case of a well drilled in permanent surface waters, “the Earth's surface” means the mean elevation of the surface of the water.
(3)
Jurisdictional agency
means the state or federal agency identified in § 270.401.
(4)
Tight formation gas
means natural gas that a jurisdictional agency has determined to be produced from a designated tight formation.

(ii) Determined to be a tight formation pursuant to section 503 of the NGPA.
(6)
Occluded natural gas produced from coal seams
means naturally occurring natural gas released from entrapment from the fractures, pores and bedding planes of coal seams.
(7)
Natural gas produced from Devonian shale
means natural gas produced from fractures, micropores and bedding planes of shales deposited during the Paleozoic Devonian Period.

A jurisdictional agency determination designating a portion of a formation as a tight formation must be made in accordance with the following guidelines:
(1) Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the estimated in situ gas permeability, throughout the pay section, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. The expected in situ permeability is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known permeabilities obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.
(2) Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the stabilized production rate of natural gas, against atmospheric pressure, of wells completed for production in such portion of such formation, without stimulation, is not expected to exceed the production rate determined in accordance with the table in this paragraph (b)(2). Such expected stabilized, pre-stimulation production rate is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known stabilized, pre-stimulation production rates obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.
If the average depth to the top of the formation (in feet)
exceeds—
but does not
exceed—
The maximum allowable production rate of natural gas (in Mcf per day)
may not exceed—

(2)
Priority 2.
Each interstate pipeline shall establish a new priority of service category designated priority two (2) which shall include all the essential agricultural use requirements calculated in accordance with § 281.207 and those storage injection volumes calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(3)
Other priority of service categories.
Each interstate pipeline may retain the priority of service categories in its currently effective tariff, but such categories shall be placed at priorities below the new priorities 1 and 2. Each interstate pipeline shall reduce the entitlements in all other existing categories of service to the extent such entitlements have been placed into the new priority of service categories 1 or 2.
(b)
Method of curtailment.
All deliveries to all customers of the interstate pipeline for all volumes of natural gas not included in priorities 1 and 2 shall be fully curtailed by the interstate pipeline before priorities 1 and 2 entitlements are curtailed. Deliveries for priority 2 entitlements shall be fully curtailed by the interstate pipelines (in accordance with the currently effective curtailment plan) before priority 1 entitlements are curtailed by the interstate pipelines. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter the operation of any “small customer” or “small distributor” exemption or waiver (as defined in an interstate pipeline's currently effective curtailment plan).
(c)
Storage
—(1)
General rule.
Interstate pipelines shall classify customer storage injection volumes in the same manner as that used in the currently effective curtailment plan.
(2)
Storage sprinkling.
Interstate pipelines which classify customer storage injection volumes on the basis of the actual end-use of the natural gas shall recalculate storage injection volumes placed in each priority of service category based upon the index of entitlements to be filed on September 15.
(3)
Other treatment of storage.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, no interstate pipeline shall recalculate or reclassify any customer storage injection volumes, and no customer storage injection volumes shall be included as priority 1 or 2 entitlements.

As reported in DOE/EIA Energy Data Report entitled
Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Utility Plants
(Annual summary data 1976-1979) and Monthly Report for January 1980). Note: All prices are delivered prices to steam electric plants. Prices paid for No. 6 fuel oil include prices paid for minor amounts of No. 4 and No. 5 fuel oil, crude and topped crude.
2
Fuel oil prices are reported on FEA Form P302-M-1, “Petroleum Industry Monthly Report for Product Prices.” Natural Gas Prices are those paid by industrial customers of major interstate pipeline companies as reported on FPC Form No. 11, “Natural Gas Pipeline Company Monthly Statement.”
3
The price data for coal is the same as shown under FPC Form No. 423 price data.
4
Mathematically the price difference ratio is P
2
—P
1
/P
1
; Where P
2
=the price of fuel oil or coal and P
1
=the price of natural gas. The ratio indicates the percent difference between natural gas and alternate fuel prices. For example in January 1980 electric utilities reported that in that month they paid 1.897 times more (189.7 percent) for No. 2 fuel oil than they paid for natural gas.
As determined in Docket No. RM79-40 NOPR issued June 3, 1980, corrected for clerical/typographical error.

§ 284.7
Firm transportation service.
(a)
Firm transportation availability.
(1) An interstate pipeline that provides transportation service under subpart B or G or this part must offer such transportation service on a firm basis and separately from any sales service.
(2) An intrastate pipeline that provides transportation service under Subpart C may offer such transportation service on a firm basis.
(3)
Service on a firm basis
means that the service is not subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives the same priority as any other class of firm service.
(4) An interstate pipeline that provided a firm sales service on May 18, 1992, and that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part, must offer a firm transportation service under which firm shippers may receive delivery up to their firm entitlements on a daily basis without penalty.
(b)
Non-discriminatory access.
(1) An interstate pipeline or intrastate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B, C or G must provide such service without undue discrimination, or preference, including undue discrimination or preference in the quality of service provided, the duration of service, the categories, prices, or volumes of natural gas to be transported, customer classification, or undue discrimination or preference of any kind.
(2) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part must provide each service on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas supplies transported under that service, whether purchased from the pipeline or another seller.
(3) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part may
not include in its tariff any provision that inhibits the development of market centers.
(c)
Reasonable operational conditions.
Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, a pipeline may impose reasonable operational conditions on any service provided under this part. Such conditions must be filed by the pipeline as part of its transportation tariff.
(d)
Segmentation.
An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service under subpart B or G of this part must permit a shipper to make use of the firm capacity for which it has contracted by segmenting that capacity into separate parts for its own use or for the purpose of releasing that capacity to replacement shippers to the extent such segmentation is operationally feasible.
(e)
Reservation fee.
Where the customer purchases firm service, a pipeline may impose a reservation fee or charge on a shipper as a condition for providing such service. Except for pipelines subject to subpart C of this part, if a reservation fee is charged, it must recover all fixed costs attributable to the firm transportation service, unless the Commission permits the pipeline to recover some of the fixed costs in the volumetric portion of a two-part rate. A reservation fee may not recover any variable costs or fixed costs not attributable to the firm transportation service. Except as provided in this paragraph, the pipeline may not include in a rate for any transportation provided under subpart B, C or G of this part any minimum bill or minimum take provision, or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue.
(f)
Limitation.
A person providing service under Subpart B, C or G of this part is not required to provide any requested transportation service for which capacity is not available or that would require the construction or acquisition of any new facilities.

§ 284.8
Release of firm capacity on interstate pipelines.
(a) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part must include in its tariff a mechanism for firm shippers to release firm capacity to the pipeline for resale by the pipeline on a firm basis under this section.
(b)(1) Firm shippers must be permitted to release their capacity, in whole or in part, on a permanent or short-term basis, without restriction on the terms or conditions of the release. A firm shipper may arrange for a replacement shipper to obtain its released capacity from the pipeline. A replacement shipper is any shipper that obtains released capacity.
(2) The rate charged the replacement shipper for a release of capacity may not exceed the applicable maximum rate, except that no rate limitation applies to the release of capacity for a period of one year or less if the release is to take effect on or before one year from the date on which the pipeline is notified of the release. Payments or other consideration exchanged between the releasing and replacement shippers in a release to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section are not subject to the maximum rate.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a firm shipper that wants to release any or all of its firm capacity must notify the pipeline of the terms and conditions under which the shipper will release its capacity. The firm shipper must also notify the pipeline of any replacement shipper designated to obtain the released capacity under the terms and conditions specified by the firm shipper.
(d) The pipeline must provide notice of offers to release or to purchase capacity, the terms and conditions of such offers, and the name of any replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section, on an Internet web site, for a reasonable period.
(e) The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the release. If more than one person offers the highest rate and meets the terms and conditions of the release, the released capacity may be allocated on a
basis provided in the pipeline's tariff, provided however, if the replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section offers the highest rate, the capacity must be allocated to the designated replacement shipper.
(f) Unless otherwise agreed by the pipeline, the contract of the shipper releasing capacity will remain in full force and effect, with the net proceeds from any resale to a replacement shipper credited to the releasing shipper's reservation charge.
(g) To the extent necessary, a firm shipper on an interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part is granted a limited-jurisdiction blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act solely for the purpose of releasing firm capacity pursuant to this section.
(h)(1) The following releases need not comply with the bidding requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:
(i) A release of capacity to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section;
(ii) A release of capacity to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section;
(iii) A release for more than one year at the maximum tariff rate; and
(iv) A release for any period of 31 days or less.
(v) If a release is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, notice of the release must be provided on the pipeline's Internet Web site as soon as possible, but not later than the first nomination, after the release transaction commences.
(2) When a release of capacity is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, a firm shipper may not roll over, extend or in any way continue the release to the same replacement shipper using the 31 days or less bidding exemption until 28 days after the first release period has ended. The 28-day hiatus does not apply to any re-release to the same replacement shipper that is posted for bidding or that qualifies for any of the other exemptions from bidding in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(3) A release to an asset manager exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section is any pre-arranged release that contains a condition that the releasing shipper may call upon the replacement shipper to deliver to, or purchase from, the releasing shipper a volume of gas up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand of the released transportation or storage capacity, as provided in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) through (h)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.
(i) If the capacity release is for a period of one year or less, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of the lesser of five months (or 155 days) or the term of the release.
(ii) If the capacity release is for a period of more than one year, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of five months (or 155 days) of each twelve-month period of the release, and on five-twelfths of the days of any additional period of the release not equal to twelve months.
(iii) If the capacity release is a release of storage capacity, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation need only be up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand under the release for storage withdrawals or injections, as applicable.
(4) A release to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section is any prearranged capacity release that will be utilized by the replacement shipper to provide the gas supply requirement of retail consumers pursuant to a retail access program approved by the state agency with jurisdiction over the local distribution company that provides delivery service to such retail consumers.

§ 284.9
Interruptible transportation service.
(a)
Interruptible transportation availability.
(1) An interstate pipeline that provides firm transportation service under subpart B or G of this part must also offer transportation service on an interruptible basis under that subpart or subparts and separately from any sales service.
(2) An intrastate pipeline that provides transportation service under Subpart C may offer such transportation service on an interruptible basis.
(3)
Service on an interruptible basis
means that the capacity used to provide the service is subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives a lower priority than such other classes of service.
(b) The provisions regarding non-discriminatory access, reasonable operational conditions, and limitations contained in § 284.7 (b), (c), and (f) apply to pipelines providing interruptible service under this section.
(c)
Reservation fee.
No reservation fee may be imposed for interruptible service. A pipeline's rate for any transportation service provided under this section may not include any minimum bill provision, minimum take provision, or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue.

www.govinfo.gov.
§ 284.10
Rates.
(a)
Applicability.
Any rate charged for transportation service under subparts B and G of this part must be established under a rate schedule that is filed with the Commission prior to commencement of such service and that conforms to the requirements of this section.
(b)
Rate objectives.
Maximum rates for both peak and offpeak periods must be designed to achieve the following three objectives:
(1) Rates for service during peak periods should ration capacity;
(2) Rates for firm service during off-peak periods and for interruptible service during all periods should maximize throughput; and
(3) The pipeline's revenue requirement allocated to firm and interruptible services should be attained by providing the projected units of service in peak and off-peak periods at the maximum rate for each service.
(c)
Rate design
—(1)
Volumetric rates.
Except as provided in § 284.7(e), any rate filed for service subject to this section must be a one-part rate that recovers the costs allocated to the service to the extent that the projected units of that service are actually purchased and may not include a demand charge, a minimum bill or minimum take provision or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue. Such rate must separately identify cost components attributable to transportation, storage, and gathering costs.
(2)
Based on projected units of service.
Any rate filed for service subject to this section must be designed to recover costs on the basis of projected units of service. The fixed costs allocated to capacity reservations, as determined in accordance with § 284.7(e), should be used along with the projected nominations accepted by the pipeline to compute the unit reservation fee. The remaining fixed costs and all variable costs should be used to determine the volumetric rate computed on the basis of projected volumes to be transported. The units projected for the service in rates filed under this section may be changed only in a subsequent rate filing under section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.
(3)
Differentiation due to time and distance.
Any rate filed for service subject to this section must reasonably reflect any material variation in the cost of providing the service due to:
(i) Whether the service is provided during a peak or an off-peak period; and
(ii) The distance over which the transportation is provided.
(4)
Cost basis for rates.
(i) Any maximum rate filed under this section must be designed to recover on a unit basis, solely those costs which are
properly allocated to the service to which the rate applies.
(ii) Any minimum rate filed under this section must be based on the average variable costs which are properly allocated to the service to which the rate applies.
(5)
Rate flexibility.
(i) Any rate schedule filed under this section must state a maximum rate and a minimum rate.
(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section the pipeline may charge an individual customer any rate that is neither greater than the maximum rate nor less than the minimum rate on file for that service.
(B) If a pipeline does not hold a blanket certificate under Subpart G of this part, it may not charge, in a transaction involving its marketing affiliate, a rate that is lower than the highest rate it charges in any transaction not involving its marketing affiliate.
(iii) The pipeline may not file a revised or new rate designed to recover costs not recovered under rates previously in effect.

Environmental compliance.
(a) Any activity involving the construction of, or the abandonment with removal of, facilities that is authorized pursuant to § 284.3(c) and subpart B or C of this part is subject to the terms and conditions of § 157.206(b) of this chapter.
(b)

(b)
Business practices and electronic communication requirements.
An interstate pipeline that transports gas under subparts B or G of this part must comply with the following requirements. The regulations in this paragraph adopt the abbreviations and definitions contained in the North American Energy Standards Board Wholesale Gas Quadrant standards incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(1) Nominations.
(i) Intra-day nominations.
(A) A pipeline must give scheduling priority to an intra-day nomination submitted by a firm shipper over nominated and scheduled volumes for interruptible shippers. When an interruptible shipper's scheduled volumes are to be reduced as a result of an intra-day nomination by a firm shipper, the interruptible shipper must be provided with advance notice of such reduction and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced.
(B) An intra-day nomination submitted on the day prior to gas flow will take effect at the start of the gas day at 9 a.m. CCT.
(ii)
Capacity release scheduling.
(A) Pipelines must permit shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. If the pipeline requires the replacement shipper to enter into a contract, the contract must be issued within one hour after the pipeline has been notified of the release, but the requirement for contracting must not inhibit the ability of the replacement shipper to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity.
(B) A pipeline must permit releasing shippers, as a condition of a capacity release, to recall released capacity and renominate such recalled capacity at each nomination opportunity. Each replacement shipper must be provided with advance notice of such recall and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced.
(iii) Within 60 days after a shipper request, a pipeline must file to make appropriate tariff changes at the Commission to allow multiple shippers associated with a designated agent or asset manager to be jointly and severally liable under a single firm transportation service agreement, subject to reasonable terms and conditions.
(2)
Flowing gas.
(i)
Operational balancing agreements.
A pipeline must enter into Operational Balancing Agreements at all points of interconnection between its system and the system of another interstate or intrastate pipeline.
(ii)
Netting and trading of imbalances.
A pipeline must establish provisions permitting shippers and their agents to offset imbalances accruing on different
contracts held by the shipper with the pipeline and to trade imbalances with other shippers where such imbalances have similar operational impact on the pipeline's system.
(iii)
Imbalance management.
A pipeline with imbalance penalty provisions in its tariff must provide, to the extent operationally practicable, parking and lending or other services that facilitate the ability of its shippers to manage transportation imbalances. A pipeline also must provide its shippers the opportunity to obtain similar imbalance management services from other providers and shall provide those shippers using other providers access to transportation and other pipeline services without undue discrimination or preference.
(iv)
Operational flow orders.
A pipeline must take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impacts of operational flow orders (OFOs) or other measures taken to respond to adverse operational events on its system. A pipeline must set forth in its tariff clear standards for when such measures will begin and end and must provide timely information that will enable shippers to minimize the adverse impacts of these measures.
(v)
Penalties.
A pipeline may include in its tariff transportation penalties only to the extent necessary to prevent the impairment of reliable service. Pipelines may not retain net penalty revenues, but must credit them to shippers in a manner to be prescribed in the pipeline's tariff. A pipeline with penalty provisions in its tariff must provide to shippers, on a timely basis, as much information as possible about the imbalance and overrun status of each shipper and the imbalance of the pipeline's system.
(3)
Communication protocols.
(i)(A) All electronic information provided and electronic transactions conducted by a pipeline must be provided on the public Internet. A pipeline must provide, upon request, private network connections using internet tools, internet directory services, and internet communication protocols and must provide these networks with non-discriminatory access to all electronic information. A pipeline may charge a reasonable fee to recover the costs of providing such an interconnection.
(B) A pipeline must implement this requirement no later than June 1, 2000.
(ii) A pipeline must comply with the following requirements for documents constituting public information posted on the pipeline web site:
(A) The documents must be accessible to the public over the public Internet using commercially available web browsers, without imposition of a password or other access requirement;
(B) Users must be able to search an entire document online for selected words, and must be able to copy selected portions of the documents; and
(C) Documents on the web site should be directly downloadable without the need for users to first view the documents on the web site.
(iii) If a pipeline uses a numeric or other designation to represent information, an electronic cross-reference table between the numeric or other designation and the information represented must be available to users, at a cost not to exceed reasonable shipping and handling.
(iv) A pipeline must provide the same content for all information regardless of the electronic format in which it is provided.
(v) A pipeline must maintain, for a period of three years, all information displayed and transactions conducted electronically under this section and be able to recover and regenerate all such electronic information and documents. The pipeline must make this archived information available in electronic form for a reasonable fee.
(vi) A pipeline must post notices of operational flow orders, critical periods, and other critical notices on its Internet web site and must notify affected parties of such notices in either of the following ways to be chosen by the affected party: Internet E-Mail or direct notification to the party's Internet URL address.
(4)
Communication and information sharing among pipelines and public utilities.
(i) A pipeline is authorized to share non-public, operational information with a public utility, as defined in § 38.2(a) of this chapter or another pipeline covered by this section, for the
purpose of promoting reliable service or operational planning.
(ii) Except as permitted in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, a pipeline and its employees, contractors, consultants, and agents are prohibited from disclosing, or using anyone as a conduit for the disclosure of, non-public, operational information received from a public utility pursuant to § 38.2 of this chapter to a third party or to its marketing function employees as that term is defined in § 358.3(d) of this chapter.

§ 284.123
Rates and charges.
(a)
General rule.
Rates and charges for transportation of natural gas authorized under § 284.122(a) shall be fair and equitable as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Election of rates.
(1) Subject to the conditions in §§ 284.7 and 284.9 of this chapter, an intrastate pipeline may elect to:
(i) Base its rates upon the methodology used:
(A) In designing rates to recover the cost of gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery or similar service (including storage service) included in one of its then effective firm sales rate schedules for city-gate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency; or
(B) In determining the allowance permitted by the appropriate state regulatory agency to be included in a natural gas distributor's rates for city-gate natural gas service; or
(ii) To use the rates contained in one of its then effective transportation rate schedules for intrastate service on file
with the appropriate state regulatory agency which the intrastate pipeline determines covers service comparable to service under this subpart.
(2)(i) If an intrastate pipeline does not choose to make any election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall apply for Commission approval, by order, of the proposed rates and charges by filing with the Commission the proposed rates and charges, and information showing the proposed rates and charges are fair and equitable. Each petition for approval filed under this paragraph must be accompanied by the fee set forth in § 381.403 or by a petition for waiver pursuant to § 384.106 of this chapter. Upon filing the petition for approval, the intrastate pipeline may commence the transportation service and charge and collect the proposed rate, subject to refund.
(ii) 150 days after the date on which the Commission received an application filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the rate proposed in the application will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service, unless within the 150 day period, the Commission either extends the time for action, or institutes a proceeding in which all interested parties will be afforded an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data and arguments. In such proceeding, the Commission either will approve the rate or disapprove the rate and order refund, with interest, of any amount which has been determined to be in excess of those shown to be fair and equitable or in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.
(iii) A Commission order approving or disapproving a transportation rate under this paragraph supersedes a rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Treatment of revenues.
The Commission presumes that all revenues received by an intrastate pipeline in connection with transportation authorized under § 284.122(a) and computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been or will be taken into account by the appropriate state regulatory agency for purposes of establishing transportation charges by the intrastate pipeline for service to intrastate customers.
(d)
Presumptions.
If the intrastate pipeline is charging a rate computed pursuant to § 284.123(b)(1), the rate charged is presumed to be:
(1) Fair and equitable; and
(2) Not in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.
(e)

Order 449, 51 FR 9187, Mar. 18, 1986, unless otherwise noted.
§ 284.261
Purpose.
This subpart exempts a person who engages in an emergency natural gas transaction, as defined for purposes of this subpart, in interstate commerce from the certificate requirements of section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and from the conditions of § 284.10, except as provided in § 284.266, and §§ 284.7-284.9 and §§ 284.11-284.13 of subpart A of this chapter.
§ 284.262
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
Emergency
means:
(1) Any situation in which an actual or expected shortage of gas supply or capacity would require an interstate pipeline company, intrastate pipeline, local distribution company, or Hinshaw pipeline to curtail deliveries of gas or provide less than the projected level of service to any pipeline customer, including any situation in which additional supplies or capacity are necessary to ensure a pipeline's contracted level of service to any customer, but not including any situation in which additional supplies or capacity are needed to increase the contracted level of service to an existing customer or to provide service to a new customer; or
(2) A sudden unanticipated loss of natural gas supply or capacity; or
(3) An anticipated loss of natural gas supply or capacity due to a foreseeable facility outage resulting from a landslide or riverbed erosion or other natural forces beyond the participant's control. Participants may seek a temporary certificate under §§ 157.17 of this chapter if the facilities to remedy the emergency cannot be constructed automatically under § 2.55(b) or § 157.208(a) of this chapter.
(4) A situation in which the participant, in good faith, determines that immediate action is required or is reasonably anticipated to be required for
protection of life or health or for maintenance of physical property.
Emergency does not mean any situation resulting from a failure by any person to transport natural gas under subpart B, C, or G of this part.
Projected level of service
means the level of gas volumes to be delivered by the company for each customer and additional gas volumes needed by a customer due solely to a weather-induced increase in requirements.
Emergency natural gas
means natural gas sold, transported, or exchanged in an emergency natural gas transaction.
Emergency natural gas transaction
means the sale, transportation, or exchange of natural gas (including the construction and operation of necessary facilities) conducted pursuant to this subpart, that is:
(1) Necessary to alleviate an emergency; and
(2) Not anticipated to extend for more than 60 days in duration.
Emergency facilities
means any facilities necessary to alleviate the emergency within the time frame established in § 284.264(b). Participants can seek permanent authority to operate the emergency facilities either under the temporary certificate provisions of § 157.17 of this chapter or the prior notice provisions of § 157.208(b) of this chapter.
Participant
means any first seller, interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, local distribution company or Hinshaw pipeline that participates in an emergency natural gas transaction under this subpart.
Recipient
means:
(1) In the case of a sale of emergency natural gas, the purchaser of such gas; or
(2) In the case of a transportation or exchange of natural gas when there is no sale of emergency natural gas under this subpart, the participant who receives the gas.
Hinshaw pipeline
means a pipeline that is exempt from the Natural Gas Act jurisdiction of the Commission by reason of section 1(c) of the Natural Gas Act.

(3) No participant may engage in an emergency natural gas transaction if its participation will adversely affect service to its existing customers.
(4) A participant may not sell emergency natural gas if, during the term of the sale, it is also purchasing emergency natural gas under this subpart, except when natural gas is being sold to relieve an emergency on another, separate segment of the participant's system.
(5) An interstate pipeline, acting in an emergency gas transaction as a broker or agent on behalf of another participant or any other person, may not receive compensation for such brokerage or agency service.
(6) A recipient of emergency natural gas that directly benefits from the service must:
(i) Provide line loss and the fuel volumes required to transport the emergency natural gas; and
(ii) Pay for the facilities required to be constructed to conduct the emergency natural gas transaction.
(b)
Duration
—(1)
Emergency sale or transportation.

§ 284.266
Rates and charges for interstate pipelines.
(a)
Transportation rates
—(1)
Rate on file.
If an interstate pipeline has on file with the Commission an effective transportation rate schedule that conforms to § 284.10, it must use volumetric rates based upon fully-allocated costs and adjusted only for time and distance.
(2)
Rate not on file.
If an interstate pipeline does not have on file with the Commission a transportation rate schedule that conforms to § 284.10, it may:
(i) Base its rates upon the methodology used in designing rates to recover the transmission and related storage costs included in one of its then-effective sales rates schedules; or
(ii) Use the rates contained in one of its transportation rate schedules on file with the Commission which the interstate pipeline determines covers service comparable to transportation service authorized under this subpart.
(b)
Interstate pipeline costs excluded from rate base.
An interstate pipeline may not include in its jurisdictional rate base any cost associated with facilities installed and operated in connection with an emergency natural gas transaction unless a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued authorizing the costs. Absent a certificate, such facilities may only be used to conduct emergency natural gas transactions or transactions authorized under section 311 of the NGPA.

§ 286.103
Notice to audited person.
An audit conducted by the Commission's staff under authority of the Natural Gas Policy Act may result in a notice of deficiency or audit report or similar document containing a finding or findings that the audited person has not complied with a requirement of the Commission with respect to, but not limited to, the following: A filed tariff
or tariffs, contracts, data, records, accounts, books, communications or papers relevant to the audit of the audited person; matters under the Standards of Conduct or the Code of Conduct; and the activities or operations of the audited person. The notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document may also contain one or more proposed remedies that address findings of noncompliance. Where such findings, with or without proposed remedies, appear in a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document, such document shall be provided to the audited person, and the finding or findings, and any proposed remedies, shall be noted and explained. The audited person shall timely indicate in a written response any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees. The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person. The audited person may move the Commission for additional time to provide a written response to the audit staff and such motion shall be granted for good cause shown. Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.
[Order 675-A, 71 FR 29785, May 24, 2006]
§ 286.104
Response to notification.
Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, with or without proposed remedies, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and any proposed remedies with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure, or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.
§ 286.105
Shortened procedure.
If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 286.103 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness
requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.
§ 286.106
Form and style.
Each copy of such memorandum must be complete in itself. All pertinent data should be set forth fully, and each memorandum should set out the facts and argument as prescribed for briefs in § 385.706 of this chapter.
§ 286.107
Verification.
The facts stated in the memorandum must be sworn to by persons having knowledge thereof, which latter fact must affirmatively appear in the affidavit. Except under unusual circumstances, such persons should be those who would appear as witnesses if hearing were had to testify as to the facts stated in the memorandum.
§ 286.108
Determination.
If no formal hearing is had the matter in issue will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts and arguments submitted.
§ 286.109
Assignment for oral hearing.
Except when there are no material facts in dispute, when a person does not consent to the shortened procedure, the Commission will assign the proceeding for hearing as provided by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter. Notwithstanding a person's not giving consent to the shortened procedure, and instead seeking assignment for hearing as provided for by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter, the Commission will not assign the proceeding for a hearing when no material facts are in dispute. The Commission may also, in its discretion, at any stage in the proceeding, set the proceeding for hearing.

If the Commission finds the proposed mitigative measures constitute a material amendment, the application will be considered filed with the Commission on the date on which the applicant filed the proposed mitigative measures, and all other provisions of § 4.35(a) of this chapter will apply.
(j)
Final determination on the petition.
The Commission will make a final determination on the petition at the time the Commission issues a license or exemption for the project.
(k)
Presumption.
(1) If, between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition, the State does not take any action under § 292.208(b)(2), the failure to take action can be the basis for a presumption that there is not substantial adverse effect on the environment (as that term is defined in § 292.202(q)).
(2) If the presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section comes into effect, it:
(i) Is only available for those adverse effects related to the natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes of the environment;
(ii) Can only operate during the time between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition; and
(iii) Has no affect on the Commission's independent obligation to find that the project will not have a substantial adverse effect on the environment under § 292.208(b)(1).
(3) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section does not take effect if the State, the Commission or an interested person demonstrates that the State has acted to protect the natural watercourse under § 292.208(b)(2).
(4) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section can be rebutted if:
(i) The Commission determines that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section; or
(ii) Any interested person, including a State, demonstrates that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.

Order 69, 45 FR 12234, Feb. 25, 1980, unless otherwise noted.
§ 292.301
Scope.
(a)
Applicability.
This subpart applies to the regulation of sales and purchases between qualifying facilities and electric utilities.
(b)
Negotiated rates or terms.
Nothing in this subpart:
(1) Limits the authority of any electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subpart; or
(2) Affects the validity of any contract entered into between a qualifying facility and an electric utility for any purchase.
§ 292.302
Availability of electric utility system cost data.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, paragraph (b) applies to each electric utility, in any calendar year, if the total sales of electric energy by such utility for purposes other than resale exceeded 500 million kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding calendar year.
(2) Each utility having total sales of electric energy for purposes other than resale of less than one billion kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding year, shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until June 30, 1982.
(b)
General rule.
To make available data from which avoided costs may be derived, not later than November 1, 1980, June 30, 1982, and not less often than every two years thereafter, each regulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall provide to its State regulatory authority, and shall maintain for public inspection, and each nonregulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall maintain for public inspection, the following data:
(1) The estimated avoided cost on the electric utility's system, solely with respect to the energy component, for various levels of purchases from qualifying facilities. Such levels of purchases shall be stated in blocks of not more than 100 megawatts for systems with peak demand of 1000 megawatts or more, and in blocks equivalent to not more than 10 percent of the system peak demand for systems of less than 1000 megawatts. The avoided costs shall be stated on a cents per kilowatt-hour basis, during daily and seasonal peak and off-peak periods, by year, for the current calendar year and each of the next 5 years;
(2) The electric utility's plan for the addition of capacity by amount and type, for purchases of firm energy and capacity, and for capacity retirements for each year during the succeeding 10 years; and
(3) The estimated capacity costs at completion of the planned capacity additions and planned capacity firm purchases, on the basis of dollars per kilowatt, and the associated energy costs
of each unit, expressed in cents per kilowatt hour. These costs shall be expressed in terms of individual generating units and of individual planned firm purchases.
(c)
Special rule for small electric utilities.
(1) Each electric utility (other than any electric utility to which paragraph (b) of this section applies) shall, upon request:
(i) Provide comparable data to that required under paragraph (b) of this section to enable qualifying facilities to estimate the electric utility's avoided costs for periods described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(ii) With regard to an electric utility which is legally obligated to obtain all its requirements for electric energy and capacity from another electric utility, provide the data of its supplying utility and the rates at which it currently purchases such energy and capacity.
(2) If any such electric utility fails to provide such information on request, the qualifying facility may apply to the State regulatory authority (which has ratemaking authority over the electric utility) or the Commission for an order requiring that the information be provided.
(d)
Substitution of alternative method.
(1) After public notice in the area served by the electric utility, and after opportunity for public comment, any State regulatory authority may require (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority), or any non-regulated electric utility may provide, data different than those which are otherwise required by this section if it determines that avoided costs can be derived from such data.
(2) Any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated utility which requires such different data shall notify the Commission within 30 days of making such determination.
(e)
State Review.
(1) Any data submitted by an electric utility under this section shall be subject to review by the State regulatory authority which has ratemaking authority over such electric utility.
(2) In any such review, the electric utility has the burden of coming forward with justification for its data.

§ 292.303
Electric utility obligations under this subpart.
(a)
Obligation to purchase from qualifying facilities.
Each electric utility shall purchase, in accordance with § 292.304, unless exempted by § 292.309 and § 292.310, any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility:
(1) Directly to the electric utility; or
(2) Indirectly to the electric utility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Obligation to sell to qualifying facilities.
Each electric utility shall sell to any qualifying facility, in accordance with § 292.305, unless exempted by § 292.312, energy and capacity requested by the qualifying facility.
(c)
Obligation to interconnect.
(1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any electric utility shall make such interconnection with any qualifying facility as may be necessary to accomplish purchases or sales under this subpart. The obligation to pay for any interconnection costs shall be determined in accordance with § 292.306.
(2) No electric utility is required to interconnect with any qualifying facility if, solely by reason of purchases or sales over the interconnection, the electric utility would become subject to regulation as a public utility under part II of the Federal Power Act.
(d)
Transmission to other electric utilities.
If a qualifying facility agrees, an electric utility which would otherwise be obligated to purchase energy or capacity from such qualifying facility may transmit the energy or capacity to any other electric utility. Any electric utility to which such energy or capacity is transmitted shall purchase such energy or capacity under this subpart as if the qualifying facility were supplying energy or capacity directly to such electric utility. The rate for purchase by the electric utility to which such energy is transmitted shall be adjusted up or down to reflect line losses pursuant to § 292.304(e)(4) and
shall not include any charges for transmission.
(e)
Parallel operation.
Each electric utility shall offer to operate in parallel with a qualifying facility, provided that the qualifying facility complies with any applicable standards established in accordance with § 292.308.
[Order 688, 71 FR 64372, Nov. 1, 2006; 71 FR 75662, Dec. 18, 2006]
§ 292.304
Rates for purchases.
(a)
Rates for purchases.
(1) Rates for purchases shall:
(i) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest; and
(ii) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.
(2) Nothing in this subpart requires any electric utility to pay more than the avoided costs for purchases.
(b)
Relationship to avoided costs.
(1) For purposes of this paragraph, “new capacity” means any purchase from capacity of a qualifying facility, construction of which was commenced on or after November 9, 1978.
(2) Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a rate for purchases satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the rate equals the avoided costs determined after consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section
(3) A rate for purchases (other than from new capacity) may be less than the avoided cost if the State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated electric utility determines that a lower rate is consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, and is sufficient to encourage cogeneration and small power production.
(4) Rates for purchases from new capacity shall be in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether the electric utility making such purchases is simultaneously making sales to the qualifying facility.
(5) In the case in which the rates for purchases are based upon estimates of avoided costs over the specific term of the contract or other legally enforceable obligation, the rates for such purchases do not violate this subpart if the rates for such purchases differ from avoided costs at the time of delivery.
(6)
Locational Marginal Price.
There is a rebuttable presumption that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Locational Marginal Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located in a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g).
(7)
Competitive Price.
A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Competitive Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located outside a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g). A Competitive Price may be either a Market Hub Price or a Combined Cycle Price, determined as follows:
(i) A
Market Hub Price
is a price established at a liquid market hub which a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility determines represents an appropriate measure of the electric utility's avoided cost for as-available energy, and is a hub to which the electric utility has reasonable access, based on an evaluation by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:
(A) Whether the hub is sufficiently liquid that prices at the hub represent a competitive price;
(B) Whether prices developed at the hub are sufficiently transparent;
(C) Whether the electric utility has the ability to deliver power from such hub to its load, even if its load is not directly connected to the hub; and
(D) Whether the hub represents an appropriate market to derive an energy price for the electric utility's purchases from the relevant qualifying facility given the electric utility's physical proximity to the hub or other factors.
(ii) A
Combined Cycle Price
is a price determined pursuant to a formula established by a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility using published natural gas price indices, a proxy heat rate, and variable operations and maintenance costs for an efficient natural gas combined-cycle generating facility. Before establishing
such a formula rate, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility must determine that the resulting Combined Cycle Price represents an appropriate measure of the purchasing electric utility's avoided cost for energy, based on its evaluation of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:
(A) Whether the cost of energy from an efficient natural gas combined cycle generating facility represents a reasonable measure of a competitive price in the purchasing electric utility's region;
(B) Whether natural gas priced pursuant to particular proposed natural gas price indices would be available in the relevant market;
(C) Whether there should be an adjustment to the natural gas price to appropriately reflect the cost of transporting natural gas to the relevant market; and
(D) Whether the proxy heat rate used in the formula should be updated regularly to reflect improvements in generation technology.
(8)
Competitive Solicitation Price.
(i) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a price determined pursuant to a competitive solicitation process to establish qualifying facility energy and/or capacity rates for sales to electric utilities, provided that such competitive solicitation process is conducted pursuant to procedures ensuring the solicitation is conducted in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner including, but not limited to, the following:
(A) The solicitation process is an open and transparent process that includes, but is not limited to, providing equally to all potential bidders substantial and meaningful information regarding transmission constraints, levels of congestion, and interconnections, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards;
(B) Solicitations are open to all sources, to satisfy that electric utility's capacity needs, taking into account the required operating characteristics of the needed capacity;
(C) Solicitations are conducted at regular intervals;
(D) Solicitations are subject to oversight by an independent administrator; and
(E) Solicitations are certified as fulfilling the above criteria by the relevant state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility through a post-solicitation report.
(ii) To the extent that the electric utility procures all of its capacity, including capacity resources constructed or otherwise acquired by the electric utility, through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the electric utility shall be presumed to have no avoided capacity costs unless and until it determines to acquire capacity outside of such competitive solicitation process. However, the electric utility shall nevertheless be required to purchase energy from qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogeneration facilities.
(iii) To the extent that the electric utility does not procure all of its capacity through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, then there shall be no presumption that the electric utility has no avoided capacity costs.
(c)
Standard rates for purchases.
(1) There shall be put into effect (with respect to each electric utility) standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less.
(2) There may be put into effect standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of more than 100 kilowatts.
(3) The standard rates for purchases under this paragraph:
(i) Shall be consistent with paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section; and
(ii) May differentiate among qualifying facilities using various technologies on the basis of the supply characteristics of the different technologies.
(d)
Purchases “as available” or pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation.
(1) Each qualifying facility shall have the option either:
(i) To provide energy as the qualifying facility determines such energy to be available for such purchases, in which case the rates for such purchases shall be based on the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery; or
(ii) To provide energy or capacity pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation for the delivery of energy or capacity over a specified term, in which case the rates for such purchases shall, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be based on either:
(A) The avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or
(B) The avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred.
(iii) The rate for delivery of energy calculated at the time the obligation is incurred may be based on estimates of the present value of the stream of revenue flows of future locational marginal prices, or Competitive Prices during the anticipated period of delivery.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may require that rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation vary through the life of the obligation, and be set at the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery.
(3)
Obtaining a legally enforceable obligation.
A qualifying facility must demonstrate commercial viability and financial commitment to construct its facility pursuant to criteria determined by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility as a prerequisite to a qualifying facility obtaining a legally enforceable obligation. Such criteria must be objective and reasonable.
(e)
Factors affecting rates for purchases.
(1) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility based on a purchasing electric utility's locational marginal price calculated by the applicable market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g), or the purchasing electric utility's applicable Competitive Price. Alternatively, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy and/or capacity from a qualifying facility based on a Competitive Solicitation Price. To the extent that capacity rates are not set pursuant to this section, capacity rates shall be set pursuant to subsection (2).
(2) To the extent that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility does not set energy and/or capacity rates pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following factors shall, to the extent practicable, be taken into account in determining rates for purchases from a qualifying facility:
(i) The data provided pursuant to § 292.302(b), (c), or (d), including State review of any such data;
(ii) The availability of capacity or energy from a qualifying facility during the system daily and seasonal peak periods, including:
(A) The ability of the electric utility to dispatch the qualifying facility;
(B) The expected or demonstrated reliability of the qualifying facility;
(C) The terms of any contract or other legally enforceable obligation, including the duration of the obligation, termination notice requirement and sanctions for non-compliance;
(D) The extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facility can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the electric utility's facilities;
(E) The usefulness of energy and capacity supplied from a qualifying facility during system emergencies, including its ability to separate its load from its generation;
(F) The individual and aggregate value of energy and capacity from qualifying facilities on the electric utility's system; and
(G) The smaller capacity increments and the shorter lead times available with additions of capacity from qualifying facilities; and
(iii) The relationship of the availability of energy or capacity from the qualifying facility as derived in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, to the ability of the electric utility to avoid costs, including the deferral of capacity additions and the reduction of fossil fuel use; and
(iv) The costs or savings resulting from variations in line losses from those that would have existed in the absence of purchases from a qualifying facility, if the purchasing electric utility generated an equivalent amount of
energy itself or purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity.
(f)
Periods during which purchases not required.
(1) Any electric utility which gives notice pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section will not be required to purchase electric energy or capacity during any period during which, due to operational circumstances, purchases from qualifying facilities will result in costs greater than those which the utility would incur if it did not make such purchases, but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy itself.
(2) Any electric utility seeking to invoke paragraph (f)(1) of this section must notify, in accordance with applicable State law or regulation, each affected qualifying facility in time for the qualifying facility to cease the delivery of energy or capacity to the electric utility.
(3) Any electric utility which fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section will be required to pay the same rate for such purchase of energy or capacity as would be required had the period described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section not occurred.
(4) A claim by an electric utility that such a period has occurred or will occur is subject to such verification by its State regulatory authority as the State regulatory authority determines necessary or appropriate, either before or after the occurrence.

§ 292.305
Rates for sales.
(a)
General rules.
(1) Rates for sales:
(i) Shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest; and
(ii) Shall not discriminate against any qualifying facility in comparison to rates for sales to other customers served by the electric utility.
(2) Rates for sales which are based on accurate data and consistent systemwide costing principles shall not be considered to discriminate against any qualifying facility to the extent that such rates apply to the utility's other customers with similar load or other cost-related characteristics.
(b)
Additional services to be provided to qualifying facilities.
(1) Upon request of a qualifying facility, each electric utility shall provide:
(i) Supplementary power;
(ii) Back-up power;
(iii) Maintenance power; and
(iv) Interruptible power.
(2) The State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) and the Commission (with respect to any nonregulated electric utility) may waive any requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if, after notice in the area served by the electric utility and after opportunity for public comment, the electric utility demonstrates and the State regulatory authority or the Commission, as the case may be, finds that compliance with such requirement will:
(i) Impair the electric utility's ability to render adequate service to its customers; or
(ii) Place an undue burden on the electric utility.
(c)
Rates for sales of back-up and maintenance power.
The rate for sales of back-up power or maintenance power:
(1) Shall not be based upon an assumption (unless supported by factual data) that forced outages or other reductions in electric output by all qualifying facilities on an electric utility's system will occur simultaneously, or during the system peak, or both; and
(2) Shall take into account the extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facilities can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the utility's facilities.
§ 292.306
Interconnection costs.
(a)
Obligation to pay.
Each qualifying facility shall be obligated to pay any interconnection costs which the State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may assess against the qualifying facility on a nondiscriminatory basis with respect to other customers with similar load characteristics.
(b)
Reimbursement of interconnection costs.
Each State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility
over which it has ratemaking authority) and nonregulated utility shall determine the manner for payments of interconnection costs, which may include reimbursement over a reasonable period of time.
§ 292.307
System emergencies.
(a)
Qualifying facility obligation to provide power during system emergencies.
A qualifying facility shall be required to provide energy or capacity to an electric utility during a system emergency only to the extent:
(1) Provided by agreement between such qualifying facility and electric utility; or
(2) Ordered under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.
(b)
Discontinuance of purchases and sales during system emergencies.
During any system emergency, an electric utility may discontinue:
(1) Purchases from a qualifying facility if such purchases would contribute to such emergency; and
(2) Sales to a qualifying facility, provided that such discontinuance is on a nondiscriminatory basis.
§ 292.308
Standards for operating reliability.
Any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may establish reasonable standards to ensure system safety and reliability of interconnected operations. Such standards may be recommended by any electric utility, any qualifying facility, or any other person. If any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility establishes such standards, it shall specify the need for such standards on the basis of system safety and reliability.
§ 292.309
Termination of obligation to purchase from qualifying facilities.
(a) After August 8, 2005, an electric utility shall not be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electric energy from a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility if the Commission finds that the qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power facility production has nondiscriminatory access to:
(1)(i) Independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale markets for the sale of electric energy; and
(ii) Wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; or
(2)(i) Transmission and interconnection services that are provided by a Commission-approved regional transmission entity and administered pursuant to an open access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers; and
(ii) Competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the qualifying facility is interconnected. In determining whether a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of transactions within the relevant market; or
(3) Wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
(b) For purposes of § 292.309(a), a renewal of a contract that expires by its own terms is a “new contract or obligation” without a continuing obligation to purchase under an expired contract.
(c) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, with the exception of paragraph (d) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory access to the market if it is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, and Commission-approved interconnection rules.
(1) If the Commission determines that a market meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, and if a qualifying facility in the relevant market is eligible for service
under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, a qualifying facility may seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating,
inter alia,
that it does not have access to the market because of operational characteristics or transmission constraints.
(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may additionally seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating that it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:
(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;
(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;
(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section;
(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;
(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or
(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.
(d)(1) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying cogeneration facility with a capacity at or below 20 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.
(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity at or below 5 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.
(3) Nothing in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) affects the rights the rights or remedies of any party under any contract or obligation, in effect or pending approval before the appropriate State regulatory authority or non-regulated electric utility on or before February 16, 2021, to purchase electric energy or capacity from or to sell electric energy or capacity to a small power production facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts under this Act (including the right to recover costs of purchasing electric energy or capacity).
(4) For purposes of implementing paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the Commission will not be bound by the standards set forth in § 292.204(a)(2).
(e) Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), ISO New England Inc. (ISO-NE), and New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) qualify as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than 5 megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to those markets through Commission-approved open access transmission tariffs and interconnection rules, and that electric utilities that are members of such regional transmission organizations or independent system operators should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.
(1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating,
inter alia,
that:
(i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or
(ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission
constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.
(2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:
(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;
(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;
(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);
(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;
(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or
(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.
(f) The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) qualifies as a market described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than five megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to that market through Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved open access protocols, and that electric utilities that operate within ERCOT should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.
(1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating,
inter alia,
that:
(i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or
(ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.
(2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:
(i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;
(ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;
(iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);
(iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;
(v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or
(vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to
markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.
(g) The California Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. satisfy the criteria of § 292.309(a)(2)(i).
(h) No electric utility shall be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase from or sell electric energy to a facility that is not an existing qualifying cogeneration facility unless the facility meets the criteria for new qualifying cogeneration facilities established by the Commission in § 292.205.
(i) For purposes of § 292.309(h), an “existing qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that:
(1) Was a qualifying cogeneration facility on or before August 8, 2005; or
(2) Had filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification or self-recertification, or an application for Commission certification, under § 292.207 prior to February 2, 2006.
(j) For purposes of § 292.309(h), a “new qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that satisfies the criteria for qualifying cogeneration facilities pursuant to § 292.205.

This description must include the process, procedures and practices of all distribution, transmission and regional transmission facilities necessary for qualifying facility access to the market.
(5) If qualifying facilities will be required to execute new interconnection agreements, or renegotiate existing agreements so that they can effectuate wholesale sales to third-party purchasers, explain the requirements, charges and the process to be followed. Also, explain any differences in these requirements as they apply to qualifying facilities compared to other generators, or to applicant-owned generation.
(6) Applicants seeking a Commission finding pursuant to § 292.309(a)(2) or (3), except those applicants located in ERCOT, also must provide evidence of competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the qualifying facility is interconnected. In demonstrating that a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, provide evidence of transactions within the relevant market. Applicants must include a list of known or potential purchasers,
e.g.
, jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional utilities as well as retail energy service providers.
(7) Signature of authorized individual evidencing the accuracy and authenticity of information provided by applicant.
(8) Person(s) to whom communications regarding the filed information may be addressed, including name, title, telephone number, and mailing address.

§ 294.101
Shortages of electric energy and capacity.
(a)
Definition of shortages of electric energy and capacity.
For purposes of this section, the term
anticipated shortages of electric or energy
means:
(1) Any situation anticipated to occur in which the generating and bulk purchased power capability of a public utility will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated demand plus appropriate reserve margins and this shortage would affect the utility's capability adequately to supply electric services to its firm power wholesale customers; or
(2) Any situation anticipated to occur in which the energy supply capability of a public utility is not sufficient to meet its customers' energy requirements and this shortage would affect the utility's capability adequately to supply electric services to its firm power wholesale customers.
(b)
Accommodation of shortages.
(1) Each public utility now serving firm power wholesale customers, shall submit a brief statement indicating how it would accommodate any shortages of electric energy or capacity affecting its firm power wholesale customers.
(2) This statement shall:
(i) Describe how the utility would assure that direct and indirect customers are treated without undue prejudice or disadvantage; and
(ii) It shall also identify any agreement, law, or regulation which might impair the utility's ability to accommodate such a shortage.
(3) Each utility shall file a copy of its statement with any appropriate State regulatory agency and all firm power wholesale customers.
(4) If a plan for accommodating any shortages of electric energy or capacity affecting its firm power wholesale customers as described in the brief statement submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section is modified, the utility must submit to the Commission and the persons described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section within 15 days of any such modification, a supplemental statement informing the Commission of those modifications.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a public utility need not file the statement with the Commission if the public utility provides in its rate schedules to firm power wholesale customers that:
(i) During electric energy and capacity shortages it will treat without undue discrimination or preference, prejudice, or disadvantage firm power wholesale customers; and
(ii) It will report any modifications to its contingency plans for accommodating shortages within 15 days to:
(A) The appropriate State regulatory agency and
(B) To the affected wholesale customers.
(c)
Reporting requirements.
Each public utility shall immediately report to the Commission, to any State regulatory authority and to firm power wholesale customers, any anticipated shortage of electric energy or capacity. The report shall include the following information:
(1) The nature and projected duration of the anticipated capacity or energy supply shortage;
(2) A list showing all firm power wholesale customers affected or likely to be affected by the anticipated shortage;
(3) Procedures for accommodating the shortage, if different from those described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(4) An estimate of the effects (reduced power and energy usage) of use of these procedures upon the utility's wholesale and retail customers; and
(5) The name, title, address and telephone number of an officer or employee of the utility who may be contacted for further information regarding the shortage and planned actions of the utility.
(d)
Reports to other government entities.
Any report filed with another governmental entity that contains the information that must be reported under this part may be filed to comply with this part.
(e)

§ 301.3
Filing procedures.
(a)
Bonneville's ASC review procedures.
The procedures established by Bonneville's Administrator provide the filing requirements for all Utilities that file an Appendix 1 with Bonneville. Utilities must file Appendix 1s, ASC forecast models, and other required documents with Bonneville in compliance with Bonneville's ASC review procedures.
(b)
Exchange Period.
The Exchange Period will be equal to the term of Bonneville's Rate Period. ASCs will change during the Exchange Period only for the reasons provided in § 301.4.
§ 301.4
Exchange Period Average System Cost determination.
(a)
Escalation to Exchange Period.
(1) This section describes the method Bonneville will use to escalate the Base Period ASC to and through the Exchange Period to calculate the Exchange Period ASC.
(2) Bonneville will escalate the Bonneville-approved Base Period ASC to the midpoint of the fiscal year for a one-year Rate Period/Exchange Period, and to the midpoint of the two-year period for a two-year Rate Period/Exchange Period to calculate Exchange Period ASCs.
(3) For purposes of the escalation referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Bonneville will use the following codes in the ASC forecast model to calculate the Exchange Period ASCs:
(i) A
G—Administrative and General.
(ii) CACNT—Customer Account.
(iii) CD—Construction, Distribution Plant.
(iv) CONSTANT—Constant.
(v) CSALES—Customer Sales.
(vi) CSERVE—Customer Service.
(vii) COAL—Coal.
(viii) DMN—Distribution Maintenance.
(ix) DOPS—Distribution Operations
(x) HMN—Hydro Maintenance.
(xi) HOPS—Hydro Operations.
(xii) INF—Inflation.
(xiii) NATGAS—Natural Gas.
(xiv) NFUEL—Nuclear Fuel.
(xv) NMN—Nuclear Maintenance.
(xvi) NOPS—Nuclear Operations.
(xvii) OMN—Other Production Maintenance.
(xviii) OOPS—Other Production Operations.
(xix) SNM—Steam Maintenance.
(xx) SOPS—Steam Operations.
(xxi) TMN—Transmission Maintenance.
(xxii) TOPS—Transmission Operations.
(xxiii) WAGES—Wages.
(4) Table 1 identifies which codes from paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply to the line items and associated FERC Accounts in the Appendix 1. Bonneville will use Global Insight as the source of data for the escalation codes identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except for the NATGAS and CONSTANT codes. For the NATGAS code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section, Bonneville will calculate the escalation rate using Bonneville's most current forecast of natural gas prices. The code CONSTANT in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section indicates that no escalation to the Account will be made.
(5) Bonneville will base the costs of power products purchased from Bonneville on Bonneville's forecast of prices for its products.
(6) Bonneville will escalate the Public Purpose Charge forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period by the same rate of growth as total Contract System Load.
(7) If any of the escalators specified in paragraph (a) of this section are no longer available, Bonneville will designate a replacement source of such escalator(s) that, as near as possible, replicates the results produced by the prior escalator. If a replacement source is not available, Bonneville will use the INF escalation code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xii) of this section as the replacement escalator.
(b)
Calculation of sales for resale and power purchases
—(1)
Long-term and intermediate-term sales for resale and power purchases.
Bonneville will use the INF escalation code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xii) of this section to escalate long-term and intermediate-term (as defined by the Commission) firm purchased power costs and long-term and intermediate-term sales for resale revenues.
(2)
Short-term sales for resale and power purchases.
(i) The short-term purchases and short-term sales for resale for the Base Period will be used as the starting values. A Utility will be allowed to include new plant additions, and to use a utility-specific forecast for the price of purchased power and for the price of sales for resale in order to value purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenue to be included in the Exchange Period ASC.
(ii) Bonneville will use the following method to determine separate market prices to forecast short-term purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenues to calculate Exchange Period ASCs:
(A) The Utility's average short-term purchased power price and short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each year for the most recent three years of actual data (Base Period and prior two years).
(B) The midpoint between the Utility's average short-term purchased power price and the average short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each of the years in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(C) The percentage spread around the Utility's midpoint between the average short-term purchase power price and short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each of the years identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(D) A weighted average spread for the Utility's most recent three years of actual data (Base Period and prior two years) will be calculated. The following weighting scale will be used:
(
1
) Three (3) times Base Period spread.
(
2
) Two (2) times (Base Period minus 1) spread.
(
3
) One (1) time (Base Period minus 2) spread.
(E) The Base Period midpoint calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section will be escalated at the same rate as Bonneville's electric market price forecast.
(F) The weighted average spread calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section will be applied to the escalated midpoint price calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section to determine the purchased power price and sales for resale price to value purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenues to be included in the Exchange Period ASC.
(iii) The method described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be used to forecast the electric market price for power purchases needed to meet load growth not met by major resource additions, and to forecast the
electric market price for any additional surplus power sales resulting from major resource additions.
(c)
Major resource additions and reductions and materiality thresholds.
(1) During the Exchange Period, Bonneville will allow changes to a Utility's ASC to account for major resource additions or reductions that are used to meet a Utility's retail load. These changes, however, must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section and the materiality threshold described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section in order for Bonneville to allow an ASC to change. The ASC reflecting the major resource addition or reduction will be determined by Bonneville in the ASC review process during the Review Period.
(2) For major resource additions, the change to ASC will become effective when the resource begins commercial operation, or power is received under the purchased power contract. For major resource reductions, the change to ASC will become effective when the resource is sold, retired, or transferred.
(3) A major resource addition or reduction must be related to one or more of the following categories to be eligible for consideration as a major resource:
(i) Production or generating resource investments;
(ii) Transmission investments;
(iii) Long-term generating contracts;
(iv) Pollution control and environmental compliance investments relating to generating resources;
(v) Long-term transmission contracts;
(vi) Hydroelectric relicensing costs and fees; and
(vii) Plant rehabilitation investments.
(4) Major resource additions or reductions that meet the criteria identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be allowed to change a Utility's ASC within an Exchange Period provided that the major resource addition or reduction results in a 2.5 percent or greater change in a Utility's Base Period ASC. Bonneville will allow a Utility to submit stacks of individual resources that, when combined, meet the 2.5 percent or greater materiality threshold, provided, however, that each resource in the stack must result in a change to the Utility's Base Period ASC of 0.5 percent or more.
(5) At the time the Utility submits its Appendix 1 filing, the Utility will provide its forecast of major resource additions or reductions and all associated costs. The forecast will cover the period from the end of the Base Period to the end of the Exchange Period.
(6) Bonneville will calculate new transmission wheeling revenues associated with new transmission investment using the following formula:
TTWR = WR (before additions) * [(NTP (before additions) + NTA)/NTP (before additions)]
Where:
TTWR = total transmission wheeling revenues
WR (before additions) = wheeling revenues (before additions)
NTA = new transmission additions
NTP (before additions) = Net Transmission Plant (before additions)
(7) The forecast of major resource additions or reduction costs to be included in the Utility's Exchange Period ASC will be reviewed by Bonneville in the ASC review process that is conducted during the Review Period.
(8) All major resources included in an ASC calculation prior to the start of the Exchange Period will be projected forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period.
(9) For each major resource addition or reduction that is forecasted to occur during the Exchange Period, Bonneville will calculate the difference in ASC between the ASC without the major resource addition or reduction and the ASC with the major resource addition or reduction (ASC delta) at the midpoint of the Exchange Period.
(10) Once the major resource addition or reduction becomes effective, as determined by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Bonneville will add the ASC delta to the Utility's existing ASC to determine its new ASC.
(11) For purposes of calculating ratios with Distribution Plant, Bonneville will escalate the Base Period average per-MWh cost of Distribution Plant forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period, and use the escalated
average cost to determine the distribution-related cost of meeting load growth since the Base Period.
(12) Bonneville will escalate the cost of General Plant, Accounts 389 through 399.1, forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period by calculating the ratio of each Account's value in the Base Period to the sum of Production, Transmission, and Distribution plant values in the Base Period, and then multiplying the Base Period ratio times the forecasted value for Production, Transmission, and Distribution plant.
(13) Bonneville will issue procedural rules to ensure the confidentiality of information provided by Utilities regarding any major resource additions or reductions as part of its review process. Bonneville will provide parties with an opportunity to comment on the rules prior to their implementation in the review process. Failure to provide needed information may result in exclusion of the related costs from the Utility's ASC. However, load growth will be assumed to be met with purchases in the wholesale market, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. If the Utility fails to supply confidential resource data, it loses the difference between the cost of the resource and the price of electricity in the wholesale market.
(d)
Forecasted Contract System Load and Exchange Load.
All Utilities are required to provide a forecast of their Contract System Load and associated Exchange Load, as well as a current distribution loss analysis as described in Endnote e of Appendix 1, with their Appendix 1 filings. The load forecast for Contract System Load and Exchange Load will start with the Base Period and extend through four (4) years after the Exchange Period. The load forecast for Contract System Load and Exchange Load will be provided on a monthly basis for the Exchange Period.
(e)
Load growth not met by major resource additions.
All forecast load growth not met by major resource additions will be met by purchased power at the forecasted utility-specific, short-term purchased power price.
(1) The Utility's forecast Load Growth will be met with electric market purchases priced at the Utility's forecast short-term purchased power price as determined in paragraph (b) of this section unless the Utility forecasts major resource additions.
(2) In the event of major resource additions, forecast Load Growth will be met by the major resource(s). If the major resource is less than total forecast load growth, the unmet Load Growth will be met with electric market purchases priced at the Utility's forecast short-term purchased power price.
(3) In the event the power provided by a major resource exceeds the Utility's forecast Load Growth, the excess power will be used to reduce the Utility's short-term purchases. If short-term power purchases are reduced to zero, any remaining power will be sold as surplus power at the short-term sales for resale price as determined in paragraph (b) of this section.
(f)
Changes to service territory.
In the event a Utility forecasts that it will acquire a new service territory, or lose a portion of its existing service territory, and the gain or loss of that territory results in a 2.5 percent or greater change to the Utility's Base Period ASC, the Utility must file two Appendix 1 filings with Bonneville as follows:
(1) First, a Base Period ASC that does not reflect the acquisition or loss of service territory; and
(2) Second, a Base Period ASC that incorporates the following changes:
(i) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Load associated with the acquisition or reduction in service territory.
(ii) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Cost associated with the acquisition or reduction of the service territory.
(iii) A forecast of capital and operating cost increases or reductions associated with the change in service territory.
(iv) A forecast of the changes in purchased power expenses, sales for resale revenues, and other debits or credits based on the changes in the service territory.
(3) Because the date of the actual change to the Utility's service territory could differ from the forecast date used to determine the ASC during the
Review Period, Bonneville will not adjust the Utility's ASC until the change in service territory takes place.
(g)
ASC determination for Consumer-owned Utilities that elect to execute Regional Dialogue High Water Mark contracts.
For Consumer-owned Utilities that elect to execute Regional Dialogue CHWM contracts, Bonneville will use the following approach:
(1) Use the RHWM System Resources as determined in the Tiered Rates Methodology (TRM) process.
(2) Determine the RHWM Exchange Load.
(3) Calculate the Utility's Contract System Cost as described in the ASC Methodology.
(4) Determine the fully allocated cost of resources used to meet Contract System Load that is not met by:
(i) The lesser of the Utility's RHWM or Forecast New Requirement, plus
(ii) Existing Resources for CHWM (as defined in the Tiered Rates Methodology).
(5) RHWM Contract System Cost = Contract System Cost minus fully allocated cost of resources (from paragraph (g)(4) of this section).
(6) RHWM Average System Cost = RHWM Contract System Cost (from paragraph (g)(5) of this section)/RHWM System Resource (from paragraph (g)(1) of this section).
(h)
Filing of Appendix 1.
Utilities must file an Appendix 1, including ASC information, by June 1 of each year, as required in § 301.3, for Bonneville's review and determination of a Base Period ASC. Utilities will file multiple, contingent, Base Period ASC filings to reflect changes to service territories as required in paragraph (f) of this section.
§ 301.5
Changes in Average System Cost methodology.
(a) The Administrator, at his or her discretion, or upon written request from three-quarters of the utilities that are parties to contracts authorized by section 5(c) of the Northwest Power Act, or from three-quarters of Bonneville's preference customers, or from three-quarters of Bonneville's direct-service industrial customers may initiate a consultation process as provided in section 5(c) of the Northwest Power Act. After completion of this process, Bonneville's Administrator may file the new ASC methodology with the Commission.
(b) The Administrator will not initiate any consultation process until one year of experience has been gained under the then-existing ASC methodology, that is, one year after the then-existing ASC methodology is adopted by Bonneville and approved by the Commission, through interim or final approval, whichever occurs first.
(c) The Administrator may, from time to time, issue interpretations of the ASC methodology. The Administrator also may modify the functionalization code of any Account to comply with the limitations identified in sections 5(c)(7)(A)-(C) of the Northwest Power Act or to conform to Commission revisions to the Uniform System of Accounts.
§ 301.6
Appendix 1 instructions.
(a) Appendix 1 is the form on which a Utility reports its Contract System Cost, Contract System Load, and other necessary data for the calculation of ASC. Appendix 1 is an electronic template consisting of seven schedules and several supporting files that must be completed by the Utility in accordance with these instructions and with the provisions of the endnotes following the schedules.
(b) Appendix 1 filings must be accompanied by an attestation statement of the Chief Financial Officer of the Utility or other responsible official who possesses the financial and accounting knowledge necessary to complete the attestation statement.
(c) The primary source of data for the Investor-owned Utilities' Appendix 1 filings is the Utility's prior year FERC Form 1 filings with the Commission. Any items not applicable to the Utility must be identified.
(d) For Consumer-owned Utilities that do not follow the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, filings must include reconciliation between Utility Accounts and the items allowed as Contract System Cost. In addition, the cost-of-service report must be reviewed by an independent accounting
or consulting firm, and must be accompanied by a report from that independent accounting or consulting firm that outlines the review work that was performed in preparing the cost-of-service report along with an assurance statement that the information contained in the cost-of-service report is presented fairly in all material respects.
(e) The Appendix 1 template is available electronically at
http://www.bpa.gov/corporate/finance/ascm/.
The primary schedules are:
(1) Schedule 1: Plant Investment/Rate Base
(2) Schedule 1A: Cash Working Capital
(3) Schedule 2: Capital Structure and Rate of Return
(4) Schedule 3: Expenses
(5) Schedule 3A: Taxes
(6) Schedule 3B: Other Included Items
(7) Schedule 4: Average System Cost
(f) The filing Utility must reference and attach work papers, documentation and other required information that support costs and loads, including details of allocation and functionalization. All references to the Commission's Accounts are to the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, as amended by subsequent Commission actions. The costs includable in the attached schedules are those includable by reason of the definitions in the Commission's Accounts. If the Commission's Accounts are later revised or renumbered, any changes will be incorporated into the Appendix 1 by reference, except to the extent Bonneville determines that a particular change results in a change in the type of costs allowable for Residential Exchange Program purposes. In that event, Bonneville will address the changes, including escalation rules, in its review process for the following Exchange Period.
(g) Bonneville may require a Utility to account for all transactions with affiliated entities as though the affiliated entities were owned in whole or in part by the Utility, if necessary, to properly determine and/or functionalize the Utility's costs.
(h) A Utility operating in more than one Pacific Northwest Jurisdiction must file one Appendix 1.
(i)(1) A Utility operating in a Jurisdiction within the Pacific Northwest and within Jurisdictions outside the Pacific Northwest must allocate its total system costs among its Jurisdictions within the Pacific Northwest and outside the Pacific Northwest in accord with the same allocation methods and procedures used by the Regulatory Body(ies) to establish Jurisdictional costs and resulting revenue requirements. The Utility's Appendix filing must include details of the allocation.
(2) The allocation must exclude all costs of additional resources used to meet loads outside the Pacific Northwest, as required by section 5(c)(7) of the Northwest Power Act. All schedule entries and supporting data must be in accord with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Practices as these principles and practices apply to the electric utility industry.
(j) A Utility must file an attestation statement with each Appendix 1 filing and supporting documentation for each Review Period.
§ 301.7
Average System Cost methodology functionalization.
(a) Functionalization of each Account included in a Utility's ASC must be according to the functionalization prescribed in Table 1,
Functionalization and Escalation Codes.
Direct analysis on an Account may be performed only if Table 1 states specifically that a Utility may perform a direct analysis on the Account, with the exception of conservation costs. Utilities will be able to functionalize all conservation-related costs to Production, regardless of the Account in which they are recorded. The direct analysis must be consistent with the directions provided in this section.
(b)
Functionalization codes.
(1) DIRECT—Direct Analysis.
(2) PROD—Production.
(3) TRANS—Transmission.
(4) DIST—Distribution/Other.
(5) PTD—Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.
(6) TD—Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.
(7) GP—General Plant Ratio.
(8) GPM—General Plant Maintenance Ratio.
(9) PTDG—Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other, General Plant Ratio.
(10) LABOR—Labor Ratio.
(c)
Functionalization requirements.
(1) Functionalization of certain Accounts may be based on Direct Analysis or with a default ratio associated with that specific Account as shown in Table 1. Once a Utility uses a specific functionalization method for an Account, the Utility may not change the functionalization method for that Account without prior written approval from Bonneville.
(2) The Utility must submit with its Appendix 1 all work papers, documents, or other materials that demonstrate that the functionalization under its Direct Analysis assigns costs, revenues, debits or credits based upon the actual and/or intended functional use of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will result in the entire account being functionalized to Distribution/Other, or Production, or Transmission, as appropriate.
(d)
Functionalization methods.
(1) Direct analysis, if allowed or required by Table 1, assigns costs, revenues, debits and credits to the Production, Transmission, and/or Distribution/Other function of the Utility. The only exception to this requirement is for Accounts that include conservation-related costs. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a Utility may conduct a Direct Analysis on any Account that contains conservation-related costs. The Direct Analysis performed by a Utility is subject to Bonneville review and approval.
(2) Bonneville will not allow a Utility to use a combination of Direct Analysis and a prescribed functionalization method for the same Account. The Utility can develop and use a functionalization ratio, or use a prescribed functionalization method, if the Utility, through Direct Analysis, can justify how the ratio reflects the functional nature of the costs, revenues, debits, or credits included in any Account.
(3) A Utility that wishes to include advertising and promotion costs related to conservation will use Direct Analysis.
(4) If a Utility records conservation costs in an Account that is functionalized to Distribution/Other, the Utility will identify and document the conservation-related costs included in the Account, and the balance of the costs will be functionalized to Distribution/Other. The presence of conservation-related costs in an Account does not authorize the Utility to perform a Direct Analysis on the entire Account. This option allows a Utility to assign conservation costs in the specified Account to Production based on analysis and support from the Utility that demonstrates the cost assignment is appropriate. The Utility must submit with its ASC filing all work papers, documents, and other materials that demonstrate the functionalization contained in its Direct Analysis and assign costs based upon the actual and/or intended functional use of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will result in the entire Account being functionalized to Distribution/Other for all schedules with the exception of items included in Schedule 3B,
Other Included Items,
where certain Accounts must be functionalized to Production as appropriate.

(7)
Statement of rates.
Rates must be stated explicitly in cents, or in dollars and cents, per barrel or other specified unit. The names or designations of the places from and to which the rates apply must be arranged in a simple and systematic manner. Any related services performed by the carrier in connection with the rates must be clearly identified and explained. Duplicative or conflicting rates for the same service are prohibited.
(8)
Routing.
Routing over which the rates apply must be stated so that the actual routes may be ascertained. This may be accomplished by stating that the rates apply via all routes of the carrier except as otherwise specifically stated in the tariff.
(9)
Explanation of abbreviations and reference marks.
Reference marks, abbreviations, and note references must be explained at the end of each tariff publication. U.S. Postal Service state

(iii) The symbols and letter designations contained in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section must not be used for any other purpose.
(iv) When the same change is made in all or in substantially all rates in a tariff, a tariff supplement, or a tariff or tariff supplement page, that fact and the nature of the change must be indicated in distinctive type at the top of the title page of the issue, or at the top of each page, as appropriate. For example: “All rates in this issue are increased,” or “All rates on this page are reduced unless otherwise indicated.”
(v) When a tariff publication that cancels a previous tariff publication does not include points of origin or destination, or rates, rules, or routes that were contained in the prior tariff publication, the new tariff publication must indicate the cancellation. If such omissions effect changes in charges or services, that fact must be indicated by the use of the symbols prescribed in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section.
(vi) Only revisions to tariff provisions identified in the filing constitute the tariff filing. Revisions to unidentified portions of the rate schedule or tariff are not considered part of the filing nor will any acceptance of the filing by the Commission constitute acceptance of such unmarked changes.
(11) Tariff publications must be consecutively numbered.

§ 341.10
Application of rates to intermediate points.
(a)
Applicability.

(b)
Intermediate point commodity rate regulations
—(1)
Intermediate origin points.
The rate for service provided to a published destination point from an origin point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate from the next more distant origin point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:
(i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more “next more distant” points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.
(ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published origin points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.
(iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published origin points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.
(iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate from the proposed intermediate origin point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply this rule from such intermediate point.
(2)
Intermediate destination points.
The rate for service provided from a published origin point to a destination point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate to the next more distant destination point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:
(i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more “next more distant” points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.
(ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published destination points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.
(iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published destination points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.
(iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate to the proposed intermediate destination point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply the provisions of this rule to such intermediate point.
(3)
Intermediate origin and destination points.
Both paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section may apply in connection with the same rate. In this instance, both regulations should be used to establish rates from intermediate points of origin to intermediate points of destination.
§ 341.11

§ 341.14
Special permission.
(a)
Procedure.
Applications for waiver of the notice and tariff requirements of section 6(3) of the interstate Commerce Act must be filed by the carrier concurrently with the tariff publication being proposed. The letter of transmittal must identify the filing as requesting a waiver under section 6(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. The application must state in detail any unusual circumstance or emergency situation that supports the requested waiver.

Issued on [
insert number
] days notice under authority of 18 CFR 341.14. This tariff publication is conditionally accepted subject to refund pending a 30 day review period.
(b)
Conditional acceptance subject to refund.
To permit short-notice filings to become effective as requested, the tariff publications filed concurrently with special permission requests for short (less than 30 days) notice will be deemed conditionally accepted for filing, subject to refund, until the Commission has had a full 30-day review period in which to process the filing. Refunds will be collected with interest as calculated according to § 340.1 of this chapter. The refund obligation will automatically terminate with no refunds due at the end of the full 30-day notice period absent an order to the contrary issued by the Commission.
(c)
Granting automatic permission.
The special permission requested will be deemed automatically granted at the end of the full 30-day notice period absent an order denying such request.
§ 341.15
Long and short haul or aggregate of intermediate rates.
(a)
Requests for relief from section 4.
Carriers may file requests for relief from the provisions of section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act in order to charge a greater amount for a shorter distance over the same line or route in the same direction, or to charge greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates. Such request will be deemed granted unless the Commission denies the request within 30 days of the filing.
(b)
Information required to be filed.
A request for section 4 relief must contain the following information:
(1) The names of the carriers for which the relief is being requested.
(2) The FERC tariff numbers which contain the rates or charges referred to in the application, and identification of all the particular and related rates in question delineating origin and destination points.
(3) An accurate and complete statement giving the basis and reasoning why section 4 relief is necessary.
(4) A statement that the lower rates for longer than for shorter hauls over the same line or route are reasonably compensatory.
(5) A map showing the pipelines and origin and destination points in question and other pertinent information.
(c)
Filing tariff publications concurrent with application.
Applications for section 4 relief must be filed concurrently with the tariff publication filing establishing those rates. The transmittal letter must identify the filing as requesting section 4 relief.
(d)
Tariff statement.
Tariff publications filed containing such rates shall plainly state on the title page of the tariff publication that the rates contained therein contravene section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act.
(e)
Rounding through rates.

§ 342.0
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, rate changes by oil pipelines shall be governed by this part.
(b)
Exception for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
This part shall not apply to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline authorized by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651,

) or to any pipeline delivering oil directly or indirectly to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
§ 342.1
General rule.
Each carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act:
(a) Must establish its initial rates subject to such Act pursuant to § 342.2; and
(b) Must make any change in existing rates pursuant to § 342.3 or § 342.4, whichever is applicable, unless directed otherwise by the Commission.
§ 342.2
Establishing initial rates.
A carrier must justify an initial rate for new service by:
(a) Filing cost, revenue, and throughput data supporting such rate as required by part 346 of this chapter; or
(b) Filing a sworn affidavit that the rate is agreed to by at least one non-affiliated person who intends to use the service in question,
provided
that if a protest to the initial rate is filed, the carrier must comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
[Order 561, 58 FR 58779, Nov. 4, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 59146, Nov. 16, 1994]
§ 342.3
Indexing.
(a)
Rate changes.
A rate charged by a carrier may be changed, at any time, to a level which does not exceed the ceiling level established by paragraph (d) of this section, upon compliance with the applicable filing and notice requirements and with paragraph (b) of this section. A filing under this section proposing to change a rate that is under investigation and subject to refund, must take effect subject to refund.
(b)
Information required to be filed with rate changes.
The carrier must comply with Part 341 of this title. Carriers must specify in their letters of transmittal required in § 341.2(c) of this chapter the rate schedule to be changed, the proposed new rate, the prior rate, the prior ceiling level, and the applicable ceiling level for the movement. No other rate information is required to accompany the proposed rate change.
(c)
Index year.
The index year is the period from July 1 to June 30.
(d)
Derivation of the ceiling level.
(1) A carrier must compute the ceiling level for each index year by multiplying the previous index year's ceiling level by the most recent index published by the Commission. The index will be published by the Commission prior to June 1 of each year.
(2) The index published by the Commission will be based on the change in the final Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG), seasonally adjusted, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the two calendar years immediately preceding the index year. The index will be calculated by dividing the PPI-FG for the calendar year immediately preceding the index year, by the previous calendar year's PPI-FG.
(3) A carrier must compute the ceiling level each index year without regard to the actual rates filed pursuant to this section. All carriers must round their ceiling levels each index year to the nearest hundredth of a cent.
(4) For purposes of computing the ceiling level for the period January 1, 1995 through June 30, 1995, a carrier must use the rate in effect on December 31, 1994 as the previous index year's ceiling level in the computation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the rate in effect on December 31, 1994 is subsequently lowered by Commission order pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the ceiling level based on such rate must be recomputed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, using the rate established by such Commission order in lieu of the rate in effect on December 31, 1994.
(5) When an initial rate, or rate changed by a method other than indexing, takes effect during the index year, such rate will constitute the applicable ceiling level for that index year. If such rate is subsequently lowered by Commission order pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the ceiling level based on such rate must be recomputed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, using the rate established by such Commission order as the ceiling level for the index year which includes the effective date of the rate established by such Commission order.
(e)
Rate decreases.
If the ceiling level computed pursuant to § 342.3(d) is below the filed rate of a carrier, that rate must be reduced to bring it into compliance with the new ceiling level; provided, however, that a carrier is not required to reduce a rate below the level deemed just and reasonable under section 1803(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, if such section applies to such rate or to any prior rate. The rate decrease must be accomplished by filing
a revised tariff publication with the Commission to be effective July 1 of the index year to which the reduced ceiling level applies.

A carrier may change a rate pursuant to this section if it shows that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the carrier and the rate resulting from application of the index such that the rate at the ceiling level would preclude the carrier from being able to charge a just and reasonable rate within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. A carrier must substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by part 346 of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under § 342.3.
(b)
Market-based rates.
A carrier may attempt to show that it lacks significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates. Until the carrier establishes that it lacks market power, these rates will be subject to the applicable ceiling level under § 342.3.
(c)
Settlement rates.
A carrier may change a rate without regard to the ceiling level under § 342.3 if the proposed change has been agreed to, in writing, by each person who, on the day of the filing of the proposed rate change, is using the service covered by the rate. A filing pursuant to this section must contain a verified statement by the carrier that the proposed rate change has been agreed to by all current shippers.

The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person. The audited person may move the Commission for additional time to provide a written response to the audit staff and such motion shall be granted for good cause shown. Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.
[Order 675-A, 71 FR 29785, May 24, 2006]
§ 349.2
Response to notification.
Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and/or proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and/or any proposed remedies with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure, or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.
§ 349.3
Shortened procedure.
If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 349.1 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.
§ 349.4
Form and style.
Each copy of such memorandum must be complete in itself. All pertinent data should be set forth fully, and each memorandum should set out the facts and argument as prescribed for briefs in § 385.706 of this chapter.
§ 349.5
Verification.
The facts stated in the memorandum must be sworn to by persons having knowledge thereof, which latter fact must affirmatively appear in the affidavit. Except under unusual circumstances, such persons should be those who would appear as witnesses if hearing were had to testify as to the facts stated in the memorandum.
§ 349.6
Determination.
If no formal hearing is had the matter in issue will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts and arguments submitted.
§ 349.7
Assignment for oral hearing.
Except when there are no material facts in dispute, when a person does not consent to the shortened procedure, the Commission will assign the proceeding for hearing as provided by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter. Notwithstanding a person's not giving consent to the shortened procedure, and instead seeking assignment for hearing as provided for by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter, the Commission will not assign the proceeding for a hearing when no material facts are in dispute. The Commission may also, in its discretion, at any stage in the proceeding, set the proceeding for hearing.

amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Some events recognized in financial statements do not have tax consequences. Certain revenues are exempt from taxation and certain expenses are not deductible. Events that do not have tax consequences do not give rise to temporary differences.
(f) “Deductible temporary difference” means temporary differences that result in deductible amounts in future years when the related asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
(g) “Deferred tax asset” means the deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards.

32. (a)
Segment of a business
refers to a component of an entity whose activities represent a separate major line of business or class of customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a department, and in some cases a joint venture or other nonsubsidiary investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of operations, and activities of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a segment of business.
(b)
Measurement date
means the date on which the management having authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.

Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the cash balance per carrier's books. The float adjustment is made by subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per carrier's books.)
34.
Float
means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash balance per carrier's books.
35. (a)
Equity security
encompasses any instrument representing ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred, and other capital stock), or the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it include treasury stock or convertible bonds.
(b)
Marketable,
as applied to an equity security, means an equity security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (
Provided,
in the later case, That quotations are available from at least three dealers.) Equity securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not considered restricted.
(c)
Market value
refers to the aggregate of the market price of a single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an entity has taken positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
(d)
Cost,
as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the original cost as adjusted for unrealized holding gains and losses.

# General Instructions
1-1
Classification of accounts.
Accounts are prescribed to record the cost of property used in transportation and related operations and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed for cost of property not used in transportation operations and for income and expenses pertaining thereto; for other investments and related income; for extraordinary and prior period items, including applicable income taxes; and for assets and liabilities.
In addition, stockholders' equity accounts, designed to segregate directly contributed capital from appropriated and unappropriated retained income,
are provided. Retained income accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital transactions; and, when authorized by the Commission, other items.
1-2
Records.
(a) Carriers shall keep their accounts and records in accordance with the prescribed accounts. In addition, clearing accounts, temporary accounts, and subdivisions of any account may be kept provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired. Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account, so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.
(b) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memorandums, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
(c) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 356 of this chapter.

1-3
Accounting period.
(a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that all transactions, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of the annual report.
(b) Changes shall not be made in the accounts for periods covered by reports that have been filed with the Commission unless the changes have first been authorized by the Commission.
1-4
Accounting method.
(a) This system of accounts shall be kept by the accrual method of accounting. The basis used for accruing income and expense items each month shall be consistently applied and any change in such basis or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be promptly reported to the Commission.
(b) When the amount of any transaction cannot be accurately determined in time for inclusion in the applicable month's accounts, an estimated amount shall be entered in the proper accounts. Appropriate adjustments shall be made as soon as the actual amounts become known or at the time a substantial change is indicated. Carriers are not required to anticipate minor items which do not appreciably affect the accounts.

Delayed items.
Ordinary delayed items and adjustments arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustments made in the year to which it pertained. When the amount of a delayed item or adjustment is relatively so large that its inclusion in net income for a single month would seriously distort the accounts for the month (but not for the year), such amount may be distributed in equal monthly charges or credits, as the case may be, to the remaining months of the calendar year. See instruction 1-6 for instructions covering extraordinary and prior period items of a nonrecurring nature.
1-6
Extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items, prior period adjustments, discontinued operations and accounting changes.
(a)
Extraordinary Items.
All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includible in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items. Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which
the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.
Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
(b)
Unusual or Infrequent Items.
Material events unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria for classification as extraordinary, shall be includible in the accounts provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing operations. Such items are not to be reported net of income taxes.
(c)
Discontinued Operations.
The results of continuing operations shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see definition 32(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of production or marketing activities for a particular line of business from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement date (see definition 32(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 32(c)).
(d)
Prior Period Adjustments.
The correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior period and adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income from the current year. All other revenues, expenses, gains, and losses recognized during a period shall be included in the net income of that period.
(e)
Accounting Changes.
A change in accounting principle or accounting entity should be referred to this Commission for approval. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income; in certain cases accounting changes may be reflected as prior period adjustments. Changes in accounting estimates should ordinarily be reflected prospectively.
(f)
Materiality.
As a general standard an item shall be considered material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
(g)
Commission Approval and accountant's letter.
Items shall be included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the Commission. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the request.

# Note:
The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting principles for further guidance in applying instruction 1-6.

Items in texts of accounts.
Items appearing in instructions and in the texts of various accounts are merely representative and are not intended to cover all of the items includible therein.
1-8
Depreciation accounting—Carrier property.
(a)
Method.
Monthly depreciation charges shall be made by the straight-line method to operating expenses in conformity with the group plan of accounting applicable to all carrier property except property included in accounts 101, 151, 171, Land, and 187, Construction Work in Progress.
(b)
Rates.
(1) Separate composite annual percentage rates will be prescribed for each depreciable account except that the Commission may authorize the use of component rates upon specific request from a carrier. Carriers becoming subject to this system of accounts and carriers acquiring property for which no rates have been previously prescribed shall file, within six months, composite annual percentage rates applicable to the book cost of each class of depreciable carrier property as will distribute the service value, by the straight-line method, in equal annual charges to operating expenses during the service life of the property. These rates shall be used by the carrier until the rates prescribed by the Commission become effective. Such rates shall, for each primary account comprised of more than one class of property, produce a depreciation charge equal to the sum of the amounts that would otherwise be chargeable for each of the various classes of property included in the account. Carriers shall base these percentage rates on estimated service values and service lives developed from engineering and other studies. The rates filed shall be accompanied by a statement showing the bases and the methods employed in the rate determination.
(2) Carriers shall be prepared at any time upon the direction of the Commission to compute and submit revised percentage rate studies. When a carrier believes that any rate prescribed by the Commission is no longer applicable, it shall submit the rate which it believes should be established supported by full particulars for consideration by the Commission.
(3) A carrier shall keep records of property and property retirements that will reflect the service life of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate methods; and also such records as will reflect the percentage of net salvage value for property retired from each class of depreciable carrier property.
(c)
Charges.
In computing monthly charges, the annual percentage rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each month and the result divided by twelve.
(d)
Retirements.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, upon the retirement of depreciable property the service value shall be charged in its entirety to account 31, Accrued Depreciation—Carrier Property. Any amounts of insurance recovered from casualty losses involving depreciable property retired shall be credited thereto.
(e)
Special accounting authority.
(1) When circumstances indicate that newly acquired property should be subject to amortization, or that the prescribed depreciation rates based on the service lives of certain property are no longer applicable, because the source of traffic will be exhausted before the end of the physical service life, the carrier shall submit to the Commission for approval amortization or depreciation rates based on the estimated remaining service life of the property accompanied by full information justifying the request.
(2) A carrier may request, or the Commission may direct, that special accounting be applied in situations causing undue inflation or deflation of depreciation reserves, such as premature or unusual retirements or sales of depreciable property, or related insurance recoveries. A carrier's request for special accounting shall contain full particulars concerning the situation, including the basis for its proposal. Alternative accounting techniques shall be applied to the extent approved or directed by the Commission.
1-9
Depreciation accounting—Noncarrier property.
Monthly depreciation charges for all depreciable property recorded in account 34, Noncarrier Property, shall be made to account 620, Income from Noncarrier Property, with
concurrent credits to account 35, Accrued Depreciation—Noncarrier Property. The depreciation charges shall be such as to distribute the service values equitably over the service life of the property.
1-10
Amortization of intangibles.
Monthly charges shall be made to account 540, Depreciation and Amortization, to amortize the cost of fixed life intangibles such as permits, patents and franchises which are directly related to pipeline operations. Monthly charges shall be made to account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges, to amortize the cost of intangibles such as goodwill which are not directly associated with pipeline operations. The amortization charges shall be such as to distribute the cost by the straight-line method in equal annual charges over the life or expected period of benefit.
1-11
Interpretation of rules.
To maintain uniformity of accounting, carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.
1-12
Accounting for income taxes.
(a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be applied to all material temporary differences (see definition 30(e)) between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, State, and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 670, Income taxes on income from continuing operations, and account 695, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable.
(b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting a deferred tax liability or asset is to be recognized for all temporary differences (see definition 30(e)) that result in taxable amounts in future years when the related asset or liability is recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability. A carrier shall apply the applicable enacted tax rate in determining the amount of deferred taxes. The carrier shall adjust its deferred tax liabilities and assets for the effect of the change in tax law or rates in the period that the change is enacted. The adjustment shall be recorded in the proper deferred tax balance sheet accounts based on the nature of the temporary difference and the related classification requirements of the account.
(c) An entity shall record the income tax effects of a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward as a deferred tax asset in the year the loss occurs. In the event that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a carrier shall reduce the asset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance should be recorded in a separate subaccount of the deferred tax asset account. The carrier shall disclose full particulars as to the nature and amount of each type of operating loss and tax credit carryforward in the notes to its financial statements.
(d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the flow through method shall credit account 670, Income taxes on income from continuing operations, or account 695, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable, and charge to account 56, Taxes payable, with the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, account 671, Provision for deferred taxes, shall reflect the difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting income) based on accounting income.
(e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries prescribed in (d) above charge account 671, “Provision for deferred taxes” or account 696, “Provision for deferred taxes—extraordinary items,” as applicable, and shall
credit account 64, Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Liabilities with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to account 671, “Provision for deferred taxes”.

# Note A:
Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax credit shall be reported promptly to the Commission. Carriers desiring to clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the deferral method to the flow through method shall submit the proposed journal entry to the Commission for consideration and advice.

# Note B:
The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Commission.

Transactions with affiliated companies.
(a) The records and supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, to furnish accurate information with supporting documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges).
(b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file contains other information to support the specific basis for charges.
(c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible device used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this instruction.
(d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales), or their estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transactions.
Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating charges or credits. (See Instruction 1-14).
(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the carrier from subdividing accounts (see Instruction 1-2(a)) for the purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.

Charges to be just and reasonable.
All charges to the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to the honest and efficient operations and management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's-length transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges.

Accounting for marketable securities owned.
(a) Accounts 11 “Temporary investments,” 20 “Investments in affiliated companies,” and 21 “Other investments” shall be maintained in such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity portion (
see
definition 35) and other securities or investments.
(b) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable equity securities in account 11 shall be considered the current portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 20 and 21 (combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio.
(c) Carriers will categorize their security investments as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading type investment securities will be recorded in accounts 640, miscellaneous income, and 660, miscellaneous income charges, as appropriate. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale type investment securities shall be recorded in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income.

Accounting for inaccurate reporting of income taxes on income from continuing operations which occurred prior to reporting year 1979.
To the extent that any oil pipeline company, required to file annual reports with the Commission, did not correctly report State or other income taxes on continuing operations for the 1976, 1977, and 1978 reporting years, such company is ordered to disclose the amount of the accounting change in the space for notes and remarks provided in its 1979 Annual Report Form P, Schedule 300-A, of the Commission.

Accounting for other comprehensive income.
(a) Carriers shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 77 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.
(b) When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 77 to avoid double counting of that amount.
[Order 627, 67 FR 67706, Nov. 6, 2002]
1-18
Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
(a) A carrier shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions, the most common of which being the normal purchases and sales scope exception. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:
(1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.
(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors.
(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net
by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.
(b) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in account 46, derivative instrument assets, or account 65, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 640, miscellaneous income, and losses recorded in account 660, miscellaneous income charges.
(c) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. An entity shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.
(d) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge to account 47, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 66, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment, a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.
(e) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 47, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 66, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.
[Order 627, 67 FR 67706, Nov. 6, 2002]

Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
(a) An
asset retirement obligation
represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a utility is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An
asset retirement cost
represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
(b) The carrier shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to account 30, Carrier property, and account 34, Noncarrier property, as appropriate, related to the property that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a carrier shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage
of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement revisions to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:
(1) The carrier shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 591, Accretion expense, for carrier property, account 620, Income (net) from noncarrier property, for noncarrier property and crediting account 67, Asset retirement obligations; and
(2) The carrier shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 67 with the corresponding adjustment to carrier property and noncarrier property accounts, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.
(c) Gains or losses resulting from the final settlement of asset retirement obligations for carrier plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount to settle the obligation, shall be recorded in account 592, Gains or losses on asset retirement obligations.
(d) Gains or losses resulting from the final settlement of asset retirement obligations for noncarrier plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount to settle the obligation, shall be recorded in account 620, Income (net) from noncarrier property.
(e) Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a carrier shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

# Instructions for Balance Sheet Accounts
2-1
Current assets.
In the group of accounts designated as current assets shall be included cash and other assets or resources commonly identified as those which are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within a one-year period. There shall not be included any amount the collection of which is not reasonably assured by the known financial condition of the debtor or otherwise. Items of current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written off to account 510, Supplies and Expenses, or to account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges, as appropriate.
2-2
Investments and special funds.
(a) This group of accounts shall include the cost of long-term investments in securities other than those of the accounting carrier, investment advances, sinking and other funds, cash value of life insurance policies, and other items of similar nature.
(b) Investment in securities shall be recorded at cost at time of acquisition excluding amounts paid for accrued interest and dividends. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount or premium, such discount or premium shall be amortized over the remaining life of the securities by periodical debits or credits to the account in which the cost of the securities is recorded with corresponding credits or debits to interest income. If the amount of the discount or premium is minor, the investment
may be maintained at actual cost without adjustment, and the amount of discount or premium recorded in the interest income account at the time the securities mature.
(c)(1)
For financial statement purposes
the carrier shall follow the principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate joint ventures (see definition 31(c)), and (2) all investments in voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an investee (see definition 31(b)). For purposes of this instruction an investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
(2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the Commission, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
(a) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see definition 31(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (c)(3) below); and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
(b) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum account discussed in paragraph (c) below.
(c) A retained income account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (c)(3) below).
(d) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior period items reported in the investee's financial statements (see instruction 1-6), and provision for deferred taxes where it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum account discussed in paragraph (c) above.
(3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
(a) Original cost of investment.
(b) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
(c) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.
(d) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity in net assets.
(e) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net assets.
(f) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since date of acquisition.
(g) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
(h) Proceeds from sale of investments.
(4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For investments made prior to
November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited term of existence.
(5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should be consistent from period to period.
(6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if the two were consolidated.
(7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
(8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed earnings or losses.
(9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.
(10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level of ownership described in paragraph (c)(1) of this instruction, the investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
(11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that described in paragraph (c)(1) of this instruction, the equity method shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income (for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amortization), and retained income (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period of time and then a purchase is made which qualifies the investment for the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of acquisition. In those situations where the information needed to apply the equity method is not determinable, the date of acquisition may be considered as January 1, 1974.
(12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial statements of annual reports filed with the Commission in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

# Note A:
The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Commission.

No charge shall be made to these accounts for pay and expenses of officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in connection with extensions, additions or replacements.
(2) Cost of material and supplies includes the purchase price (less purchase and trade discounts) of material and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free delivery; costs of inspection and loading borne by the carrier; transportation charges; sales, use and excise taxes; and when applicable a proportionate share of stores expenses.

(3)(i) Cost of special machine service includes the cost of labor expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and operating vehicles, equipment, and other machines used in construction work; and rents paid for the use of such machines.
(ii) When machines are purchased primarily for a construction project, their cost shall be charged to account 187, Construction Work in Progress. Upon completion of the construction project, account 187 shall be credited with amounts received for machines sold or the book cost (less a fair allowance for depreciation during the construction period) of machines retained for use in carrier service. The net book cost shall be included in the appropriate carrier property accounts.
(iii) The cost of repairs to vehicles and other work equipment and of machine tools and machinery which are used both in construction and maintenance work shall be apportioned equitably to the work in connection with which the equipment is used.
(4) Cost of transportation includes the amounts paid to other companies or individuals for the transportation of employees, material and supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection with construction and also the cost of hauling performed by the carrier's own forces and facilities. The cost of the transportation of construction material to the point where material is received by the carrier shall be included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of such material.
(5) Cost of contract work includes amounts paid for construction work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and cost incident to the award of the contract.

Insurance recovered for compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts to which such compensation is charged. Any insurance recovered for damages to property incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts chargeable with the expenditures necessary for restoring the damaged property. The cost of injuries and damages in connection with the removal of old structures which are encumbrances on newly acquired lands shall be included in the cost of land, or rights of way.
(8) Cost of privileges and permits includes compensation for temporary privileges, such as the use of private or
public property or of streets, in connection with construction work.
(9) Taxes include taxes on property during construction and before the facilities are completed and ready for service. This includes taxes on land held under a definite plan for its use in pipeline service for the period prior to the completion of pipeline facilities thereon and other taxes separately assessed on property during construction, or assessed under conditions which permit separate identification or allocation of the amount chargeable to construction.

The interest shall be included in the accounts charged with the cost of the property to which related.
(ii) There shall be deducted from such interest charges a proportion of premium on securities sold. There shall be added a proportion of discount and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition or construction of carrier property. The amount of premium and discount and expense thus related shall be determined by the ratio which the period between the date the proceeds from the securities issued become available and the receipt, completion, or coming into service of the property bears to the entire life of the securities issued.
(iii) Interest during construction shall not be recognized on the asset retirement costs incurred during the construction of carrier and noncarrier property.
(12) Cost of disposing of excavated material shall be included in the cost of construction except that when such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work for which removal is made and the work for which the material is used.

When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired. Oil pipelines must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested.

Resulting increases or decreases in the length of the line shall be accounted for as additions or retirements of property.
(b) In accounting for relocation of trunk lines involving units of property, the replaced property shall be retired and the cost of the new property included in the appropriate primary property accounts.

Acquisition by merger, consolidation or purchase.
Accounting for property acquired by business combination of two or more corporations, or the acquisition of properties comprising a distinct operating system, or integral portion thereof as specified in section 3-1, shall depend on whether there has been (1) a merger or consolidation in a “pooling of interests” or (2) a “purchase.” A “pooling of interests” may
exist when holders of all or substantially all of the ownership interests, usually common stock, in the constituent corporations or entities become the owners of a surviving corporation or a new corporation which owns the assets and business of the constituent corporations or entities directly or through one or more subsidiaries. However, when the stockholders of one of the constituent corporations obtain 90 percent or more of the voting interest in the combined enterprise; or when there is a plan or firm intention and understanding to retire a substantial part of the capital stock issued to the owners of one or more of the constituent corporations or substantial changes in ownership which occurred shortly before or planned to occur shortly after the combination, the combination may be considered a “purchase.”
(a)
Accounting under a “pooling in interest.”
(1) In accounting for a “pooling of interests,” no new basis of accountability arises. The assets and liabilities of the constituent companies or entities and the related accrued depreciation and amortization accounts along with the retained income or deficit accounts shall be carried forward, adjusted, if necessary, to conform with the accounting rules of the Commission.
(2) When the total par value or stated value of no-par capital stock of the succeeding corporation is greater than that of the constituent corporations, the excess shall be charged first to the amount in account 73, Additional Paid-in Capital, that is not otherwise restricted, and the Balance to account 75, Unappropriated Retained Income.
(3) When the par value or stated value of no-par capital stock of the succeeding corporation is less than that of the constituent corporations, the difference shall be credited to account 73, Additional Paid-in Capital.
(b)
Accounting under a “purchase.”
In accounting for a “purchase,” the assets shall be recorded on the books of the acquiring carrier at cost as of the date of acquisition or, if other than money is given, at the fair value of such consideration. Liabilities assumed shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts according to the accounting rules of the Commission.
(c)
Approval of accounting.
(1) Tentative journal entries recording the acquisition of pipeline properties shall be submitted to the Commission for consideration and approval. The entries shall give a complete description of the property purchased and the basis upon which the amounts of the entries have been determined. Any portion of the purchase price attributable to intangible property shall be separately recorded as hereinafter provided in account 40, Organization Costs and Other Intangibles.
(2) When the costs of individual or groups of transportation property are not specified in the agreement or in supporting documents, or when separate costs are not provided for the physical property and the intangible property, the total purchase price shall be equitably apportioned among the appropriate property or other accounts, based on the percentage relationship between the purchase price and the original cost of property shown in the valuation records of the Commission or the fair market value of the properties. The portion of the total price assignable to the physical property shall be supported by independent appraisal or such other information as the Commission may consider appropriate. In no event shall amounts recorded for physical properties and other assets acquired exceed the total purchase price.
(3)(a) Where the purchase price is in excess of amounts recorded for the net assets acquired, such excess shall be included in account 40, Organization Costs and Other Intangibles.
(b) The excess of the purchase price over amounts includable in the primary carrier property accounts shall be amortized through account 660, “Miscellaneous income charges,” or otherwise disposed of, as the Commission may approve or direct.

reorganization shall be submitted to this Commission for consideration and approval.
3-13
Disposition of former Account 193, Acquisition Adjustment.
Amounts included in former account 193, Acquisition Adjustment, attributable to mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, and purchases of property shall be cleared from that account as the Commission may authorize or direct upon submission of proposal for distribution of the amounts therein.

General instructions.

Preservation of records for oil pipeline companies.

# Authority:

# Source:
Order 617, 65 FR 48166, Aug. 7, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 356.1
Promulgation.
This part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by oil pipeline companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein. This part is enforceable as of the date the oil pipeline company becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.
§ 356.2
General instructions.
(a)
Scope of this part.
(1) The regulations in this part apply to all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the oil pipeline companies.
(2) The regulations in this part must not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.
(3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in the schedule in § 356.3, duplicate copies of records may be destroyed at any time. Provided, however, that such duplicate copies must not contain significant information not shown on the originals.
(5) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the oil pipeline company. Provided, however, that records which are used in lieu of those listed must be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes and that retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, must conform to the principles embodied herein.
(6) Notwithstanding the provision of the records retention schedule, the Commission may, upon request of the oil pipeline company, authorize shorter retention periods for any records listed in § 356.3. The oil pipeline companies must show that the longer retention periods are no longer necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest, investors, or consumers. A waiver from any provision of these regulations may be made by the Commission upon its own initiative or upon submission of a written request by the company. Each request for waiver must demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with such prescribed requirements would impose an unreasonable burden on the company.
(b)
Designation of supervisory official.
Each oil pipeline company subject to the provision of this part must designate one or more persons to supervise the oil pipeline company's program for preservation and authorized destruction of records.
(c)
Protection and storage of records.
Each oil pipeline company subject to these regulations must provide reasonable protection for records. The records must have protections from fire, floods, and other hazards. Storage spaces, will also prevent unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.
(d)
Record storage media.
(1) Each oil pipeline company has the flexibility to select its own storage media.
(2) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 356.3 unless there is a quality
transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.
(3) Each oil pipeline company is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of and ready access to data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.
(e)
Destruction of records.
Oil pipeline companies may use any appropriate method to destroy permitted records.
(f)
Premature destruction or loss of records.
When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed, and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of such destruction.
(g)
Retention periods designated “Destroy at option”.
“Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory action or directives.
(h)
Records of services performed by associated companies.
Oil pipeline companies must assure the availability of records of services performed by associated companies for the periods indicated in § 356.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of transaction, the involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.

Any holding company system or state commission seeking such an exemption shall bear the burden of demonstrating that such an exemption is warranted.
(d) Nothing in paragraphs (a)-(c) of this section shall affect the authority of the Commission under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791

), the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717
et seq.
), or other applicable law, including the authority of the Commission with respect to rates, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, practices, contracts, facilities, and services under the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, and with respect to access to books and records under the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act.
§ 366.6
Previously authorized activities.
(a)
General.
Unless otherwise provided by Commission rule or order, a person may continue to engage in activities or transactions authorized under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 prior to the effective date of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, February 8, 2006, until the later of the date such authorization expires or December 31, 2007, so long as that person continues to comply with the terms of such authorization. If any such activities or transactions are challenged in a formal Commission proceeding, the person claiming prior authorization shall be required to provide at that time the full text of any such authorization (whether by rule, order, or letter) and
the application(s) or pleading(s) underlying such authorization (whether by rule, order, or letter).
(b)
Financing Authorizations.
Holding companies that intend to rely on financing authorization orders or letters issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission must file these orders or letters with the Commission within 30 days after the effective date of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, February 8, 2006; any reports or other submissions that, pursuant to such financing authorizations, previously were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission must instead be filed with the Commission, effective February 8, 2006. For the purposes of this section, compliance with the terms of such financing authorizations includes the requirement to notify the Commission of any financing transactions that a holding company engages in pursuant to such financing authorization.
§ 366.7
Procedures for obtaining exempt wholesale generator and foreign utility company status.
(a)
Self-certification notice procedure.
An exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company, or its representative, may file with the Commission a notice of self-certification demonstrating that it satisfies the definition of exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company (including stating the location of its generation); such notices of self-certification must be subscribed, consistent with § 385.2005(a) of this chapter, but need not be verified. In the case of exempt wholesale generators, the person filing a notice of self-certification under this section must also file a copy of the notice of self-certification with the state regulatory authority of the state in which the facility is located, and that person must also represent to this Commission in its submittal with this Commission that it has filed a copy of the notice of self-certification with the state regulatory authority of the state in which the facility is located. Notice of the filing of a notice of self-certification will be published in the
Federal Register.
Persons that file a notice of self-certification must include a form of notice suitable for publication in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the specifications in § 385.203(d) of this chapter. A person filing a notice of self-certification in good faith will be deemed to have temporary exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status. If the Commission takes no action within 60 days from the date of filing of the notice of self-certification, the self-certification shall be deemed to have been granted; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)) any self-certification of an exempt wholesale generator may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary (if such determinations are not necessary, the notice of self-certification should state so). The Commission may toll the 60-day period to request additional information, or for further consideration of the request; in such cases, the person's exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status will remain temporary until such time as the Commission has determined whether to grant or deny exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)), any self-certification of an exempt wholesale generator may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary (if such determinations are not necessary, the notice of self-certification should state so). Authority to toll the 60-day period is delegated to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, and authority to act on uncontested notices of self-certification is delegated to the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee.
(b)
Optional procedure for Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status or foreign utility company status.
A person may file for a Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status or foreign utility company status under § 366.1 by filing a petition for declaratory order pursuant to § 385.207(a) of this chapter, justifying
the request for such status; however, consistent with section 32(c) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79z-5a (c)), a Commission determination of exempt wholesale generator status may not become effective until the relevant state commissions have made the determinations provided for therein if such determinations are necessary. (If such determinations are not necessary, the petition for declaratory order should state so.) Persons that file petitions must include a form of notice suitable for publication in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the specifications in § 385.203(d) of this chapter.
(c)
Procedure for notification of material change in facts.
If there is any material change in facts that may affect an exempt wholesale generator's or a foreign utility company's status as an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company, the exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company shall within 30 days of the material change in facts:
(1) Submit a new notice of self-certification or a new petition for declaratory order, pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate;
(2) File a written explanation why the material change in facts does not affect its status; or
(3) Notify the Commission that it no longer seeks to maintain its exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status.
(d)
Revocation of status.
(1) If an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company fails to conform to the criteria for such status or fails to conform with any material facts or representations presented in its submittals to the Commission, the notice of self-certification of the status of the facility or Commission order certifying the status of the facility may no longer be relied upon.
(2) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the complaint of any person, revoke the status of a facility or company, if the facility or company fails to conform to any of the criteria under this part for such status.
(e) An exempt wholesale generator shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7,
i.e.
, procedures for obtaining exempt wholesale generator status. A foreign utility company shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7,
i.e.
, procedures for obtaining foreign utility company status.

This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. When conducted on behalf of an associate or non-associate utility company such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future business of such company. The term includes, but is not limited to: All the costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of alternate sources of electricity or substitute or synthetic gas supplies (alternate fuel sources, for example, an experimental coal gasification plant or an experimental plant synthetically producing gas from liquid hydrocarbons); and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application.

(47)
Service life
means the time between the date property is placed in service, or property is leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.

means the difference between the cost and net salvage value of service property.
(49)
State commission
means any commission, board, agency, or officer, by whatever name designated, of a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of a State that, under the laws of such State, has jurisdiction to regulate public-utility companies.

[Order 684, 71 FR 65226, Nov. 7, 2006, as amended by Order 731, 74 FR 68529, Dec. 28, 2009]
§ 367.3
Records.
(a) Each service company must keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda that support the entries in the books of account, so as to be able to furnish full information on any item included in any account. Each entry must be supported by sufficient detailed information that will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant and related to the records.
(b) The books and records referred to in this part include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minutes books, stock books, reports, correspondence, and memoranda, that may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
(c) No service company may destroy any books or records unless the destruction is permitted by the rules and regulations of the Commission.
(d) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subaccounts of any accounts may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
(e) The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed in this part must not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms that may be prescribed by the Commission.
§ 367.4
Numbering system.
(a) The account numbering plan used in this part consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:
(1) 100-199, Assets and other debits.
(2) 200-299, Liabilities and other credits.
(3) 300-399, Property accounts.
(4) 400-432 and 434-435, Income accounts.
(5) 433, 436 and 439, Retained earnings accounts.
(6) 457-458, Revenue accounts.
(7) 500-599, Electric operating expenses.
(8) 800-894, Gas operating expenses.
(9) 900-949, Customer accounts, customer service and informational, sales, and general and administrative expenses.
(b) The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles. Each service company, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (
See also
General Instructions in § 367.3(d)) provided that the numbers prescribed in this part must appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a service company uses a different system of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, the reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Each service company using different account numbers for its own purposes must keep readily available a list of the account numbers that it uses and a reconciliation of those account numbers with the account numbers provided in this part. It is intended that the service company's records must be kept so as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from the records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.
§ 367.5
Accounting period.
Each service company must keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable
to the account, as nearly as may be ascertained, must be entered in the books of the service company. Amounts applicable or assignable to a single or group of associate and non-associate companies must be segregated monthly. Each service company must close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.
§ 367.6
Submittal of questions.
To maintain uniformity of accounting, service companies must submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.
§ 367.7
Item list.
Lists of items appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere in this part are for the purpose of indicating clearly the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.
§ 367.8
Extraordinary items.
Extraordinary items are to be recognized according to the rules which are considered generally accepted accounting principles. These items are related to the effects of events and transactions that have occurred during the current period and that are of an unusual nature and infrequent occurrence. Each item recognized as extraordinary must be disclosed in the notes to financial statements (
See
Accounts 434 and 435 in §§ 367.4340 and 367.4350).
§ 367.9
Prior period items.
(a) Items of profit and loss related to the following must be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:
(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.
(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carry forwards of purchased subsidiaries.
(b) All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year must be included in the determination of net income for that year.
§ 367.10
Unaudited items.
Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred that affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount must be estimated and the estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The service company is not required to anticipate minor items that would not appreciably affect the accounts.
§ 367.11
Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.
The charges to property, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, must be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or an appropriate allocation method.
§ 367.12
Payroll distribution.
Underlying accounting data must be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. The underlying data must permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, or operating functions.
§ 367.13
Accounting to be on accrual basis.
(a) The service company is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount that affect the accounts. If bills covering the transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts must be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received. When the
amount is ascertained, the necessary adjustments must be made through the accounts in which the estimate was recorded. If it is determined during the interval that a material adjustment will be required, the estimate must be adjusted through the current accounts. The service company is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect these accounts.
(b) When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest, the amount applicable to future periods must be charged to account 165, Prepayments (§ 367.1650), and spread over the periods to which they are applicable by credits to account 165 (§ 367.1650), and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.
§ 367.14
Transactions with associate companies.
Each service company must keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associate companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved in the transactions and the amounts included in each account prescribed in this part with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associate companies must be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing contained in this part, however, must be construed as restraining the service company from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associate companies.
§ 367.15
Contingent assets and liabilities.
Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the service company contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items that, under certain conditions, may become obligations of the service company but that are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The service company must be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.
§ 367.16
Long-term debt: Premium, discount and expense, and gain or loss on reacquisition.
(a) A separate premium, discount and expense account must be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the service company. The premium must be recorded in account 225, Unamortized premium on long-term debt (§ 367.2250), the discount must be recorded in account 226, Unamortized discount on long-term debt—Debit (§ 367.2260), and the expense of issuance must be recorded in account 181, Unamortized debt expense (§ 367.1810). The premium, discount and expense must be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan that will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization must be on a monthly basis, and the amounts relating to discounts and expenses must be charged to account 428, Amortization of debt discount and expense (§ 367.4280). The amounts relating to premiums must be credited to account 429, Amortization of premium on debt—Credit (§ 367.4290).
(b) When long-term debt is reacquired the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed must be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), or account 426.5, Other deductions (§ 367.4265).
§ 367.17
Comprehensive inter-period income tax allocation.
(a) Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods
in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive inter-period tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified in this section.
(b) Once comprehensive inter-period tax allocation has been initiated, either in whole or in part, it must be practiced on a consistent basis and must not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.
(c) Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated deferred income taxes (§ 367.1900), 282, Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property (§ 367.2820), and 283, Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other (§ 367.2830), as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts must be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.
§ 367.18
Criteria for classifying leases.
(a) If, at its inception, a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease must be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it must be classified as an operating lease.
(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.
(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any related profit, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee must compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless:
(i) It is practicable for the company to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and
(ii) The implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.
(iii) If both of those conditions are met, the lessee must use the implicit rate.
(b) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement must be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section must be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, must be considered as a new agreement and must be classified according to the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) must not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
§ 367.19
Accounting for leases.
(a) All leases must be classified as either capital or operating leases.
(b) The service company must record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under capital leases
(§ 367.1011) and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under capital leases—Non-current (§ 367.2270), or account 243, Obligations under capital leases—Current (§ 367.2430), at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any related profit. However, if the determined amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation must be the fair value.
(c) The service company, as a lessee, must recognize an asset retirement obligation (
See
General Instructions in § 367.22) arising from the property under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The service company must record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases (§ 367.1011), and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300). Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1 (§ 367.1011) must be amortized by charging rent expense (
see
Operating Expense Instructions in § 367.82) or account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), must be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense (§ 367.4118), for service company property, and account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), for non-service company property and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300).
(d) Rental payments on all leases must be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.
(e) For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation must be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.
§ 367.20
Depreciation accounting.
(a)
Method.
Service companies must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.
(b)
Service lives.
Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by objective evidence and analysis, including where appropriate engineering, economic, or other depreciation studies.
(c)
Rate.
Service companies must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they must be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.
§ 367.22
Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
(a) An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible, long-lived asset that a service company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract, or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost must be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
(b) The service company must initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), and charge the associated asset retirement costs to service company property (including account 101.1 in § 367.1011) related to the property that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost must be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a service company must recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), as follows:
(1) The service company must record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense (§ 367.4118); and
(2) The service company must recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to service company property. The service company must on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.
(c) Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with service company property resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), and;
(2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions (§ 367.4265).
(d) Separate subsidiary records must be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analysis, a service company must maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.
§ 367.23
Transactions with non-associate companies.
When a service or construction is performed for non-associate companies at an amount other than cost, the amount of revenues in excess or deficiency of the cost on servicing the non-associate companies must be charged to account 458.4, Excess or deficiency on servicing non-associate utility companies (§ 367.4584). A deficiency incurred in a project deemed beneficial to the associate companies may be charged to associate companies subject to disallowance by a State Commission or Federal Commission having jurisdiction over the rates or services of the associate companies. To the extent not charged, or if disallowed, the deficiency will be charged to account 458.4 (§ 367.4584). In computing charges to associate companies for any calendar year, any net credit in this account must be deducted from amounts reimbursable by associate companies as compensation for use of capital invested in the service company.
§ 367.24
Construction and service contracts for other companies.
(a) Expenditures made in the performance of construction or service contracts, under which the service
company undertakes projects to construct physical property for associate or non-associate companies must be recorded in Account 412, Cost and expenses of construction or other services (§ 367.4120). The service company must keep records pursuant to its cost allocation system indicating the cost of each contract or project, the amount of service costs allocated to the contracts, and the additional classification of expenditures relating to projects that will meet the accounting requirements of the company for which the work is performed.
(b) Account 412 (§ 367.4120) will include:
(1) The cost of materials, construction payrolls, outside services, and other expenses which are directly attributable to the performance of service or construction contracts for other companies.
(2) The cost of goods procured directly attributable to the performance of service or construction contracts for other companies.
(3) The related salaries, expense of officers and employees, pay of employees on the service company's regular staff specifically assigned to construction work, and other expenses of maintaining the service company's organization and equipment.
(4) The support services performed by the service company in connection with the procurement of goods for associate companies.
§ 367.25
Determination of service cost.
A service must be deemed at cost and fair allocation of costs requires an accurate accounting for the elements that makes up the aggregate expense of conducting the business of the service company. In the accounts prescribed in this part, the total amounts included in the expense accounts during any period plus the amount that appropriately may be added as compensation for the use of capital constitute cost during that period.
§ 367.26
Departmental classification.
Salaries and wages and all other costs must be classified by departmental or other functional category in accordance with the departmental organization of the service company to provide a readily available basis for analysis.
§ 367.27
Billing procedures.
Charges for services to associate public-utility companies must be made monthly with sufficient information and in sufficient detail to permit such company, where applicable, to identify and classify the charge in terms of the system of accounts prescribed by the regulatory authorities to which it is subject. The information provided to associate public-utility companies must provide a summary of the accounts by service provided and showing the charges, classified as direct cost, indirect cost, and compensation for use of capital.
§ 367.28
Methods of allocation.
Indirect costs and compensation for use of capital must be allocated to projects in accordance with the service company's applicable and currently effective methods of allocation. Both direct and allocated indirect costs on projects must be assigned among those companies in the same manner. The cost accumulation system must identify the methods of allocation and the accounts to be charged. Companies must be notified in writing of any change in the methods of allocation.
§ 367.29
Compensation for use of capital.
A servicing transaction is deemed to be performed at no more than cost if the price of the service does not exceed a fair and equitable allocation of expenses plus reasonable compensation for necessary capital procured through the issuance of capital stock. Interest on borrowed capital and compensation for the use of capital must only represent a reasonable return on the amount of capital reasonably necessary for the performance of services or construction work for, or the sale of goods to, associate companies. The compensation may be estimated and must be computed monthly. The amount of compensation must be stated separately in each billing to the associate companies. An annual statement to support the amount of compensation for use of capital billed for the previous 12 months and how it was calculated
must be supplied to each associate company at the end of the calendar year.
§ 367.30
Cost accumulation system for associate companies.
Service companies must maintain a detailed classification of service costs, that permits costs to be identified with the functional processes of the associate companies served. To permit the classification, each service company must maintain a cost accumulation system, as described in Definitions § 367.1(a)(12), for accumulating reimbursable costs and charges to the associate companies served, and maintain time records for all service company employees in order to support the accounting allocation of all expenses assignable to the types of services performed and chargeable to the associate companies served. Service company employee records must permit a ready identification of the hours worked, account numbers charged, and other code designations that facilitate proper classification.

# Subpart C—Service Company Property Instructions
§ 367.50
Service company property to be recorded at cost.
(a) All amounts included in the accounts for service company property must be stated at the cost incurred by the service company, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instructions in § 367.18, Criteria for classifying leases, and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under capital leases (§ 367.1011).
(b) When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of the consideration must be determined on a cash basis (
See, however,
Definitions § 367.1(a)(11)). In the entry recording the transaction, the actual consideration must be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The service company must be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration, if other than cash.
(c) When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge must be made to the service company property accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.
(d) The service company property accounts must not include the cost or other value of service company property contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of property must be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Property constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent must be shown as a reduction to gross property constructed when assembling cost data for posting to property ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of property must be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently recorded as a credit.
§ 367.51
Components of construction.
(a) For service companies, the cost of construction properly included in the service company property accounts must include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined as follows:

(3)(i) Materials and supplies includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the service company's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance must be made
for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.
(ii) The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools and implements, must not be charged to service company property accounts unless the correctness of the accounting is verified by current inventories. The cost must be charged to the appropriate operating expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of the items, or, if the items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost must be included as part of the cost of the construction.
(4) Transportation includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the service company's own transportation equipment. (
See
paragraph (a)(5) of this section.)
(5) Special machine service includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (
See
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the associated net book cost, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, must be included in the cost of construction.
(6) Shop service includes the proportion of the expense of the service company's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the service company's shop must be included in materials and supplies.
(7) Protection includes the cost of protecting the service company's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, related witness fees, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work.
(8) Injuries and damages includes expenditures or losses in connection with construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of, and defense against, actions for the injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction must be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction must be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages.
(9) Privileges and permits includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents.

(15) Law expenditures includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the directly related court and legal costs, other than law expenses included in protection in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, and in injuries and damages in paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(16) Taxes include taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service.
(17) Interest cost on funds used during construction which are allowed to be capitalized following generally accepted accounting principles.
(18)
Earnings and expenses during construction.
The earnings and expenses during construction must constitute a component of construction costs.
(19)
Training costs.
When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain property that is being constructed and the property is not conventional in nature, or is new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once property is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs must cease and subsequent training costs must be expensed. (
See
Operating Expense Instructions in § 367.83.)
(20) Studies include the costs of studies such as safety or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to property under construction. Studies relative to facilities in service must be charged to account 183, Preliminary survey and investigation charges (§ 367.1830).
(21)
Asset retirement costs.
The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of service company property must constitute a component of construction costs.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 367.52
Overhead construction costs.
(a) All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the service company, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, must be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of the reasonably applicable overheads.
(b) As far as practicable, the determination of payroll charges includible in construction overheads must be based on the related time card distributions. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies must be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only the overhead costs that have a definite relation to construction must be capitalized.
(c) The records supporting the entries for overhead construction costs must be kept so as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction project and to each property account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.
§ 367.53
Service company property purchased or sold.
(a) When service company property is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including related incidental expenses, must be charged to the appropriate service company property accounts and account 107, Construction work in progress (§ 367.1070), as appropriate.
(b) If property acquired is in a physical condition so that it is necessary to rehabilitate it substantially in order to bring the property up to the standards
of the service company, the cost of the work, except replacements, must be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.
(c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, all service company property acquired from an affiliate company must be recorded at its book value. Additionally, if property is acquired that is in excess of $10 million and has been previously devoted to public service at a price above book value, the service company must file with the Commission the proposed journal entries associated with the acquisition within six months from the date of acquisition of the property.
(d) When service company property is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another must be credited to the appropriate service company property accounts. The amounts (estimated, if not known) carried with respect the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization must be charged to those accounts. The difference, if any, between the net amount of debits and credits and the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be included in account 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211), or account 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212).
(e) In connection with the acquisition of service company property previously devoted to service company operations or acquired from an associate company, the service company must procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired or related certified copies, and must preserve the records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.
§ 367.54
Expenditures on leased property.
(a) The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made to prepare service company property leased to be used for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to the property, must be charged to the service company property account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements must be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404, Amortization of limited-term service property (§ 367.4040). However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, must be accounted for as depreciable property. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.
(b) If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements must be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization.
§ 367.55
Land and land rights.
(a) The accounts for land and land rights must include the cost of land owned in fee by the service company and rights. Interests, and privileges held by the service company in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of property. The costs must be included in the appropriate property accounts directly benefited.
(b) Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments must be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance must be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances must be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the
related amount must be charged to the appropriate tax account.
(c) The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands must be credited to the appropriate property account to which it is related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources must be credited to the appropriate operating income account when the land has been recorded in account 101, Service company property (§ 367.1010), otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210).
(d) Separate entries must be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights of way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year. A record must be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights must refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.
(e) Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, must be included in account 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211), or account 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212), when the property has been recorded in account 101, Service company property (§ 367.1010). Appropriate adjustments of the accounts must be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on the land sold.
(f) The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) must not be included in the land accounts. If, at the time of acquisition of an interest in land the interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) that are then devoted to operations, the land and improvements must be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking must be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded.
(g) Provisions must be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. (
See
account 111, Accumulated provision for amortization of service company property in § 367.1110, and account 404, Amortization of limited-term property in § 367.4040.)
(h) The items of cost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows:
(1) Bulkheads, buried, not requiring maintenance or replacement.
(2) Cost, first, of acquisition including mortgages and other liens assumed (but not the related subsequent interest).

(10) Special assessments levied by public authorities for public improvements on the basis of benefits for new roads, new bridges, new sewers, new curbing, new pavements, and other public improvements, but not taxes
levied to provide for the maintenance of such improvements.
(11) Surveys in connection with the acquisition, but not amounts paid for topographical surveys and maps where the costs are attributable to structures or plant equipment erected or to be erected or installed on the land.
(12) Taxes assumed, accrued to date of transfer of title.
(13) Title, examining, clearing, insuring and registering in connection with the acquisition and defending against claims relating to the period prior to the acquisition.
(14) Appraisals prior to closing title.
(15) Cost of dealing with distributees or legatees residing outside of the state or county, such as recording power of attorney, recording will or exemplification of will, recording satisfaction of state tax.
(16) Filing satisfaction of mortgage.

§ 367.56
Structures and improvements.
(a) The accounts for structures and improvements must include the cost of all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons, including all fixtures permanently attached to and made a part of buildings and that cannot be removed from the buildings and facilities without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors, or without in some way impairing the buildings, and improvements of a permanent character on, or to, land. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of property.
(b) The cost of specially-provided foundations not intended to outlast the machinery or apparatus for which provided, and associated costs, such as angle irons, castings, and other items installed at the base of an item of equipment, must be charged to the same account as the cost of the machinery, apparatus, or equipment.
(c) Where the structure of a dam also forms the foundation of the service company building, the foundation must be considered a part of the dam.
(d) The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures must be considered as a part of the cost of that work, except as follows:

§ 367.57
Equipment.
(a) The cost of equipment chargeable to the service company property accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the related net purchase price, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the service company, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the service company in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of property.
(b) Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, that are likely to be lost or stolen or that have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the related accounting as service company property is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment must be included in the appropriate property account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, or similar items, or in stores, must be charged to the property account appropriate for their use.
(c) The equipment accounts must include angle irons and similar items that are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations that are designed to be as permanent as the buildings that house the equipment, or that are constructed as a part of the building and that cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, must be included in the building accounts.
(d) The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service must be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, and similar items, guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate service company property account.
§ 367.58
Property record system required for service company property.
(a) Each service company must keep its cost allocation system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of service company property, the related total cost, the source or sources of costs, and the property account or accounts to which charged or credited. Records covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.
(b) Each service company must maintain records in which, for each property account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.
§ 367.59
Additions and retirements of property.
(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of service company property, all property will be considered as consisting of retirement units and minor items of property. Each company must maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of property and apply the listing consistently.
(b) The addition and retirement of retirement units must be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a retirement unit is added, the related cost must be added to the appropriate service company property account.
(2) When a retirement unit is retired, with or without replacement, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included, determined in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to service company property must be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to the property. The cost of removal and the salvage must be charged or credited, as appropriate, to the depreciation account.
(c) The addition and retirement of minor items of property must be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a minor item of property that did not previously exist is added to service company property, the related cost must be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge must be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.
(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable property, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation must be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when the unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when the minor item is retired.
(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement must be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item. However, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment must be charged to the appropriate property account.
(d) The book cost of service company property retired must be the amount at which the property is included in the property accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost must be determined from the service company's records and, if this cannot be done, it must be estimated. Service companies must furnish the particulars of the estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or related small cost, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, must be used as the book cost of the units retired.
(e) The book cost of land retired must be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for related depreciation or amortization that has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be recorded in accounts 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211) or 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212), as appropriate.
(f) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable service company property retired must be charged in its entirety to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of service company property (§ 367.1080).
(g) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 303, Miscellaneous intangible property (§ 367.3030), and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, must be as provided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated provision for amortization of service company property (§ 367.1110), account 404, Amortization of limited-term property
(§ 367.4040), and account 405, Amortization of other property (§ 367.4050).

When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain facilities that are being constructed, the related costs must be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses must be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities that are not conventional in nature, or are new to the service company's operations, these costs may be capitalized until the time that the facilities are ready for functional use.

The
amounts recorded in this account are generally to be charged, concurrently with the recovery of the amounts in rates, to the same account that would have been charged if included in income when incurred, except all regulatory assets established through the use of account 407.4 (§ 367.4074) must be charged to account 407.3, Regulatory debits (§ 367.4073), concurrent with the recovery in rates.

See
Definitions § 367.1(a)(40)), except those expenditures properly chargeable to account 107, Construction work in progress (§ 367.1070).
(b) Costs that are minor or of a general or recurring nature must be transferred from this account to the appropriate operating expense function or, if the costs are common to the overall
operations or cannot be feasibly allocated to the various operating accounts, then the costs must be recorded in account 930.2, Miscellaneous general expenses (§ 367.9302).
(c) In certain instances, a service company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures that are nonrecurring and that would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period.

The credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 (§ 367.4101), or 410.2 (§ 367.4102) must, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the service company's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the service company was authorized by the Commission.
(c) The service company is restricted in its use of this account to the purpose provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The service company must not make use of the balance in this account or any related portion except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the Commission.
