(ii) In addition to the expenses set forth in section 217(b)(2) paid or incurred by the taxpayer attributable to property sold, purchased, or leased by the taxpayer alone, the same type of expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer attributable to property sold, purchased, or leased by the taxpayer's spouse or by the taxpayer and his spouse are deductible providing such property is used by the taxpayer as his principal place of residence.
(c)
Conditions for allowance
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(c) provides two conditions which must be satisfied in order for a deduction of moving expenses to be allowed under section 217(a). The first is a minimum distance condition prescribed by section 217(c)(1), and the second is a minimum period of employment condition prescribed by section 217(c)(2).
(2)
Minimum distance.
For purposes of applying the minimum distance condition of section 217(c)(1) all taxpayers are divided into one or the other of the following categories: Taxpayers having a former principal place of work, and taxpayers not having a former principal place of work. Included in this latter category are individuals who are seeking fulltime employment for the first time either as an employee or on a self- employed basis (for example, recent high school or college graduates), or individuals who are reentering the labor force after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment.
(i) In the case of a taxpayer having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(A) provides that no deduction is allowable unless the distance between the former residence and the new principal place of work exceeds by at least 35 miles (50 miles in the case of expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) the distance between the former residence and the former principal place of work.
(ii) In the case of a taxpayer not having a former principal place of work, section 217(c)(1)(B) provides that no deduction is allowable unless the distance between the former residence and the new principal place of work is at least 35 miles (50 miles in the case of expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977).
(iii) For purposes of measuring distances under section 217(c)(1) the distance between two geographic points is measured by the shortest of the more commonly traveled routes between such points. The shortest of the more commonly traveled routes refers to the line of travel and the mode or modes of transportation commonly used to go between two geographic points comprising the shortest distance between such points irrespective of the route used by the taxpayer.
(3)
Principal place of work.
(i) A taxpayer's
principal place of work
usually is the place where he spends most of his working time. The principal place of work of a taxpayer who performs services as an employee is his employer's plant, office, shop, store, or other property. The principal place of work of a taxpayer who is self-employed is the plant, office, shop, store, or other property which serves as the center of his business activities. However, a taxpayer may have a principal place of work even if there is no one place where he spends a substantial portion of his working time. In such case, the taxpayer's principal place of work is the place where his business activities are centered—for example, because he reports there for work, or is required either by his employer or the nature of his employment to “base” his employment there. Thus, while a member of a
railroad crew may spend most of his working time aboard a train, his principal place of work is his home terminal, station, or other such central point where he reports in, checks out, or receives instructions. The principal place of work of a taxpayer who is employed by a number of employers on a relatively short-term basis, and secures employment by means of a union hall system (such as a construction or building trades worker) would be the union hall.
(ii) Where a taxpayer has more than one employment (i.e., the taxpayer is employed by more than one employer, or is self-employed in more than one trade or business, or is an employee and is self-employed at any particular time) his principal place of work is determined with reference to his principal employment. The location of a taxpayer's principal place of work is a question of fact determined on the basis of the particular circumstances in each case. The more important factors to be considered in making this determination are (
a
) the total time ordinarily spent by the taxpayer at each place, (
b
) the degree of the taxpayer's business activity at each place, and (
c
) the relative significance of the financial return to the taxpayer from each place.
(iii) Where a taxpayer maintains inconsistent positions by claiming a deduction for expenses of meals and lodging while away from home (incurred in the general location of the new principal place of work) under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and by claiming a deduction under this section for moving expenses incurred in connection with the commencement of work at such place of work, it will be a question of facts and circumstances as to whether such new place of work will be considered a principal place of work, and accordingly, which category of deductions he will be allowed.
(4)
Minimum period of employment.
(i) Under section 217(c)(2) no deduction is allowed unless:
(
a
) Where a taxpayer is an employee, during the 12-month period immediately following his arrival in the general location of the new principal place of work, he is a full-time employee, in such general location, during at least 39 weeks, or
(
b
) Where a taxpayer is a self-employed individual (including a taxpayer who is also an employee, but is unable to satisfy the requirements of the 39-week test of (a) of this subdivision (i)), during the 24-month period immediately following his arrival in the general location of the new principal place of work, he is a full-time employee or performs services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis, in such general location, during at least 78 weeks, of which not less than 39 weeks are during the 12-month period referred to above.
Where a taxpayer works as an employee and at the same time performs services as a self-employed individual his principal employment (determined according to subdivision (i) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) governs whether the 39-week or 78-week test is applicable.
(ii) The 12-month period and the 39- week period set forth in subparagraph (A) of section 217(c)(2) and the 12- and 24-month periods as well as 39- and 78- week periods set forth in subparagraph (B) of such section are measured from the date of the taxpayer's arrival in the general location of the new principal place of work. Generally, date of arrival is the date of the termination of the last trip preceding the taxpayer's commencement of work on a regular basis and is not the date the taxpayer's family or household goods and effects arrive.
(iii) The taxpayer need not remain in the employ of the same employer or remain self-employed in the same trade or business for the required number of weeks. However, he must be employed in the same general location of the new principal place of work during such period. The
general location
of the new principal place of work refers to a general commutation area and is usually the same area as the “new place of residence”; see paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
(iv) Only those weeks during which the taxpayer is a full-time employee or during which he performs services as a self-employed individual on a full-time
basis qualify as a week of work for purposes of the minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2).
(
a
) Whether an employee is a full-time employee during any particular week depends upon the customary practices of the occupation in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works. Where employment is on a seasonal basis, weeks occurring in the off-season when no work is required or available may be counted as weeks of full-time employment only if the employee's contract or agreement of employment covers the off-season period and such period is less than 6 months. Thus, for example, a schoolteacher whose employment contract covers a 12-month period and who teaches on a full-time basis for more than 6 months is considered a full-time employee during the entire 12-month period. A taxpayer will be treated as a full-time employee during any week of involuntary temporary absence from work because of illness, strikes, shutouts, layoffs, natural disasters, etc. A taxpayer will, also, be treated as a full-time employee during any week in which he voluntarily absents himself from work for leave or vacation provided for in his contract or agreement of employment.
(
b
) Whether a taxpayer performs services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis during any particular week depends on the practices of the trade or business in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works. For example, a self-employed dentist maintaining office hours 4 days a week is considered to perform services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis providing it is not unusual for other self-employed dentists in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works to maintain office hours only 4 days a week. Where a trade or business is seasonal, weeks occurring during the off-season when no work is required or available may be counted as weeks of performance of services on a full-time basis only if the off-season is less than 6 months and the taxpayer performs services on a full-time basis both before and after the off-season. For example, a taxpayer who owns and operates a motel at a beach resort is considered to perform services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis if the motel is closed for a period not exceeding 6 months during the off-season and if he performs services on a full-time basis as the operator of a motel both before and after the off-season. A taxpayer will be treated as performing services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis during any week of involuntary temporary absence from work because of illness, strikes, natural disasters, etc.
(v) Where taxpayers file a joint return, either spouse may satisfy the minimum period of employment condition. However, weeks worked by one spouse may not be added to weeks worked by the other spouse in order to satisfy such condition. The taxpayer seeking to satisfy the minimum period of employment condition must satisfy the condition applicable to him. Thus, if a taxpayer is subject to the 39-week condition and his spouse is subject to the 78-week condition and the taxpayer satisfies the 39-week condition, his spouse need not satisfy the 78-week condition. On the other hand, if the taxpayer does not satisfy the 39-week condition, his spouse in such case must satisfy the 78-week condition.
(vi) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is an electrician residing in New York City. He moves himself, his family, and his household goods and personal effects, at his own expense, to Denver where he commences employment with the M Aircraft Corporation. After working full-time for 30 weeks he voluntarily leaves his job, and he subsequently moves to and commences employment in Los Angeles, CA, which employment lasts for more than 39 weeks. Since A was not employed in the general location of his new principal place of employment in Denver for at least 39 weeks, no deduction is allowable for moving expenses paid or incurred between New York City and Denver. A will be allowed to deduct only those moving expenses attributable to his move from Denver to Los Angeles, assuming all other conditions of section 217 are met.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A's wife commences employment in Denver at the same time as A, and that she continues to work in Denver for at least 9 weeks after A's departure for Los Angeles. Since she has met the 39-week requirement in Denver, and assuming all other requirements of section 217 are met, the moving expenses paid by A attributable to
the move from New York City to Denver will be allowed as a deduction, provided A and his wife file a joint return. If A and his wife file separate returns moving expenses paid by A's wife attributable to the move from New York City to Denver will be allowed as a deduction on A's wife's return.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A's wife commences employment in Denver on the same day that A departs for Los Angeles, and continues to work in Denver for 9 weeks thereafter. Since neither A (who has worked 30 weeks) nor his wife (who has worked 9 weeks) has independently satisfied the 39-week requirement, no deduction for moving expenses attributable to the move from New York City to Denver is allowable.
(d)
Rules for application of section 217(c)(2)
—(1)
Inapplicability of minimum period of employment condition in certain cases.
Section 217(d)(1) provides that the minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2) does not apply in the case of a taxpayer who is unable to meet such condition by reason of:
(i) Death or disability, or
(ii) Involuntary separation (other than for willfull misconduct) from the service of an employer or separation by reason of transfer for the benefit of an employer after obtaining full-time employment in which the taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy such condition.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this paragraph disability shall be determined according to the rules in section 72(m)(7) and § 1.72-17(f). Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies only where the taxpayer has obtained full-time employment in which he could reasonably have been expected to satisfy the minimum period of employment condition. A taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy the minimum period of employment condition if at the time he commences work at the new principal place of work he could have been expected, based upon the facts known to him at such time, to satisfy such condition. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer at the time of transfer was not advised by his employer that he planned to transfer him within 6 months to another principal place of work, the taxpayer could, in the absence of other factors, reasonably have been expected to satisfy the minimum employment period condition at the time of the first transfer. On the other hand, a taxpayer could not reasonably have been expected to satisfy the minimum employment condition if at the time of the commencement of the move he knew that his employer's retirement age policy would prevent his satisfying the minimum employment period condition.
(2)
Election of deduction before minimum period of employment condition is satisfied.
(i) Paragraph (2) of section 217(d) provides a rule which applies where a taxpayer paid or incurred, in a taxable year, moving expenses which would be deductible in that taxable year except that the minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2) has not been satisfied before the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year. The rule provides that where a taxpayer has paid or incurred moving expenses and as of the date prescribed by section 6072 for filing his return for such taxable year (determined with regard to extensions of time for filing) there remains unexpired a sufficient portion of the 12-month or the 24-month period so that it is still possible for the taxpayer to satisfy the applicable period of employment condition, the taxpayer may elect to claim a deduction for such moving expenses on the return for such taxable year. The election is exercised by taking the deduction on the return.
(ii) Where a taxpayer does not elect to claim a deduction for moving expenses on the return for the taxable year in which such expenses were paid or incurred in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and the applicable minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2) (as well as all other requirements of section 217) is subsequently satisfied, the taxpayer may file an amended return or a claim for refund for the taxable year such moving expenses were paid or incurred on which he may claim a deduction under section 217.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is transferred by his employer from Boston, MA, to Cleveland, OH. He begins working there on November 1, 1970.
Moving expenses are paid by A in 1970 in connection with this move. On April 15, 1971, when he files his income tax return for the year 1970, A has been a full-time employee in Cleveland for approximately 24 weeks. Although he has not satisfied the 39-week employment condition at this time, A may elect to claim his 1970 moving expenses on his 1970 income tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining before November 1, 1971, to satisfy such condition.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that on April 15, 1971, A has voluntarily left his employer and is looking for other employment in Cleveland. A may not be sure he will be able to meet the 39-week employment condition by November 1, 1971. Thus, he may if he wishes wait until such condition is met and file an amended return claiming as a deduction the expenses paid in 1970. Instead of filing an amended return A may file a claim for refund based on a deduction for such expenses. If A fails to meet the 39-week employment condition on or before November 1, 1971, no deduction is allowable for such expenses.

# Example 3.
B is a self-employed accountant. He moves from Rochester, NY, to New York, NY, and begins to work there on December 1, 1970. Moving expenses are paid by B in 1970 and 1971 in connection with this move. On April 15, 1971, when he files his income tax return for the year 1970, B has been performing services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis in New York City for approximately 20 weeks. Although he has not satisfied the 78-week employment condition at this time, A may elect to claim his 1970 moving expenses on his 1970 income tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining before December 1, 1972, to satisfy such condition. On April 15, 1972, when he files his income tax return for the year 1971, B has been performing services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis in New York City for approximately 72 weeks. Although he has not met the 78-week employment condition at this time, B may elect to claim his 1971 moving expenses on his 1971 income tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining before December 1, 1972, to satisfy such requirement.
(3)
Recapture of deduction.
Paragraph (3) of section 217(d) provides a rule which applies where a taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) prior to satisfying the applicable minimum period of employment condition and such condition cannot be satisfied at the close of a subsequent taxable year. In such cases an amount equal to the expenses deducted must be included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year in which the taxpayer is no longer able to satisfy such minimum period of employment condition. Where the taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 217(d)(2) for the taxable year and subsequently files an amended return for such year on which he does not claim the deduction, such expenses are not treated as having been deducted for purposes of the recapture rule of the preceding sentence.
(e)
Denial of double benefit
—(1)
In general.
Section 217(e) provides a rule for computing the amount realized and the basis where qualified real estate expenses are allowed as a deduction under section 217(a).
(2)
Sale or exchange of residence.
Section 217(e) provides that the amount realized on the sale or exchange of a residence owned by the taxpayer, by the taxpayer's spouse, or by the taxpayer and his spouse and used by the taxpayer as his principal place of residence is not decreased by the amount of any expenses described in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2) and deducted under section 217(a). For the purposes of section 217(e) and of this paragraph the term amount realized” has the same meaning as under section 1001(b) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer sells a residence used as his principal place of residence and real estate commissions or similar expenses described in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2) are deducted by him pursuant to section 217(a), the amount realized on the sale of the residence is not reduced by the amount of such real estate commissions or such similar expenses described in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2).
(3)
Purchase of a residence.
Section 217(e) provides that the basis of a residence purchased or received in exchange for other property by the taxpayer, by the taxpayer's spouse, or by the taxpayer and his spouse and used by the taxpayer as his principal place of residence is not increased by the amount of any expenses described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2) and deducted under section 217(a). For the purposes of section 217(e) and of this paragraph the term
basis
has the same meaning as under section 1011 and the regulations thereunder. Thus,
for example, if a taxpayer purchases a residence to be used as his principal place of residence and attorneys' fees or similar expenses described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2) are deducted pursuant to section 217(a), the basis of such residence is not increased by the amount of such attorneys' fees or such similar expenses described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2).
(4)
Inapplicability of section 217(e).
(i) Section 217(e) and subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph do not apply to any expenses with respect to which an amount is included in gross income under section 217(d)(3). Thus, the amount of any expenses described in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2) deducted in the year paid or incurred pursuant to the election under section 217(d)(2) and subsequently recaptured pursuant to section 217(d)(3) may be taken into account in computing the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the residence described in such subparagraph. Also, the amount of expenses described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2) deducted in the year paid or incurred pursuant to such election under section 217(d)(2) and subsequently recaptured pursuant to section 217(d)(3) may be taken into account as an adjustment to the basis of the residence described in such subparagraph.
(ii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A was notified of his transfer effective December 15, 1972, from Seattle, WA, to Philadelphia, PA. In connection with the transfer A sold his house in Seattle on November 10, 1972. Expenses incident to the sale of the house of $2,500 were paid by A prior to or at the time of the closing of the contract of sale on December 10, 1972. The amount realized on the sale of the house was $47,500 and the adjusted basis of the house was $30,000. Pursuant to the election provided in section 217(d)(2), A deducted the expenses of moving from Seattle to Philadelphia including the expenses incident to the sale of his former residence in taxable year 1972. Dissatisfied with his position with his employer in Philadelphia, A took a position with an employer in Chicago, IL, on July 15, 1973. Since A was no longer able to satisfy the minimum period employment condition at the close of taxable year 1973 he included an amount equal to the amount deducted as moving expenses including the expenses incident to the sale of his former residence in gross income for taxable year 1973. A is permitted to decrease the amount realized on the sale of the house by the amount of the expenses incident to the sale of the house deducted from gross income and subsequently included in gross income. Thus, the amount realized on the sale of the house is decreased from $47,500 to $45,000 and thus, the gain on the sale of the house is reduced from $17,500 to $15,000. A is allowed to file an amended return or a claim for refund in order to reflect the recomputation of the amount realized.

# Example 2.
B, who is self-employed decided to move from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles, CA. In connection with the commencement of work in Los Angeles on March 1, 1973, B purchased a house in a suburb of Los Angeles for $65,000. Expenses incident to the purchase of the house in the amount of $1,500 were paid by B prior to or at the time of the closing of the contract of sale on September 15, 1973. Pursuant to the election provided in section 217(d)(2), B deducted the expenses of moving from Washington to Los Angeles including the expenses incident to the purchase of his new residence in taxable year 1973. Dissatisfied with his prospects in Los Angeles, B moved back to Washington on July 1, 1974. Since B was no longer able to satisfy the minimum period of employment condition at the close of taxable year 1974 he included an amount equal to the amount deducted as moving expenses incident to the purchase of the former residence in gross income for taxable year 1974. B is permitted to increase the basis of the house by the amount of the expenses incident to the purchase of the house deducted from gross income and subsequently included in gross income. Thus, the basis of the house is increased to $66,500.
(f)
Rules for self-employed individuals
—(1)
Definition.
Section 217(f)(1) defines the term
self-employed individual
for purposes of section 217 to mean an individual who performs personal services either as the owner of the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business or as a partner in a partnership carrying on a trade or business. The term
self-employed individual
does not include the semiretired, part-time students, or other similarly situated taxpayers who work only a few hours each week. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A is the owner of the entire interest in an unincorporated construction business. A hires a manager who performs all of the daily functions of the business including the negotiation of contracts with customers,
the hiring and firing of employees, the purchasing of materials used on the projects, and other similar services. A and his manager discuss the operations of the business about once a week over the telephone. Otherwise A does not perform any managerial services for the business. For the purposes of section 217, A is not considered to be a self-employed individual.
(2)
Rule for application of subsection (b)(1) (C) and (D).
Section 217(f)(2) provides that for purposes of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) an individual who commences work at a new principal place of work as a self-employed individual is treated as having obtained employment when he has made substantial arrangements to commence such work. Whether the taxpayer has made substantial arrangements to commence work at a new principal place of work is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in each case. The factors to be considered in this determination depend upon the nature of the taxpayer's trade or business and include such considerations as whether the taxpayer has: (i) Leased or purchased a plant, office, shop, store, equipment, or other property to be used in the trade or business, (ii) made arrangements to purchase inventory or supplies to be used in connection with the operation of the trade or business, (iii) entered into commitments with individuals to be employed in the trade or business, and (iv) made arrangements to contact customers or clients in order to advertise the business in the general location of the new principal place of work. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a partner in a growing chain of drug stores decided to move from Houston, TX, to Dallas, TX, in order to open a drug store in Dallas. A made several trips to Dallas for the purpose of looking for a site for the drug store. After the signing of a lease on a building in a shopping plaza, suppliers were contacted, equipment was purchased, and employees were hired. Shortly before the opening of the store A and his wife moved from Houston to Dallas and took up temporary quarters in a motel until the time their apartment was available. By the time he and his wife took up temporary quarters in the motel A was considered to have made substantial arrangements to commence work at the new principal place of work.

# Example 2.
B, who is a partner in a securities brokerage firm in New York, NY, decided to move to Rochester, NY, to become the resident partner in the firm's new Rochester office. After a lease was signed on an office in downtown Rochester B moved to Rochester and took up temporary quarters in a motel until his apartment became available. Before the opening of the office B supervised the decoration of the office, the purchase of equipment and supplies necessary for the operation of the office, the hiring of personnel for the office, as well as other similar activities. By the time B took up temporary quarters in the motel he was considered to have made substantial arrangements to commence to work at the new principal place of work.

# Example 3.
C, who is about to complete his residency in ophthalmology at a hospital in Pittsburgh, PA, decided to fly to Philadelphia, PA, for the purpose of looking into opportunities for practicing in that city. Following his arrival in Philadelphia C decided to establish his practice in that city. He leased an office and an apartment. At the time he departed Pittsburgh for Philadelphia C was not considered to have made substantial arrangements to commence work at the new principal place of work, and, therefore, is not allowed to deduct expenses described in subparagraph (C) of section 217(b)(1) (relating to expenses of traveling (including meals and lodging), after obtaining employment, from the former residence to the general location of the new principal place of work and return, for the principal purpose of searching for a new residence).
(g)
Rules for members of the Armed Forces of the United States
—(1)
In general.
The rules in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), (b), and (e) of this section apply to moving expenses paid or incurred by members of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty who move pursuant to a military order and incident to a permament change of station, except as provided in this paragraph (g). However, if the moving expenses are not paid or incurred incident to a permanent change of station, this paragraph (g) does not apply, but all other paragraphs of this section do apply. The provisions of this paragraph apply to taxable years beginning December 31, 1975.
(2)
Treatment of services or reimbursement provided by Government
—(i)
Services in kind.
The value of any moving or storage services furnished by the United States Government to members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, or their dependents in connection with a
permanent change of station is not includible in gross income. The Secretary of Defense and (in cases involving members of the peacetime Coast Guard) the Secretary of Transportation are not required to report or withhold taxes with respect to those services. Services furnished by the Government include services rendered directly by the Government or rendered by a third party who is compensated directly by the Government for the services.
(ii)
Reimbursements.
The following rules apply to reimbursements or allowances by the Government to members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, or their dependents for moving or storage expenses paid or incurred by them in connection with a permanent change of station. If the reimbursement or allowance exceeds the actual expenses paid or incurred, the excess is includible in the gross income of the member, and the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Transportation must report the excess as payment of wages and withhold income taxes under section 3402 and the employee taxes under section 3102 with respect to that excess. If the reimbursement or allowance does not exceed the actual expenses, the reimbursement or allowance in not includible in gross income, and no reporting or withholding by the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Transportation is required. If the actual expenses, as limited by paragraph (b)(9) of this section, exceed the reimbursement of allowance, the member may deduct the excess if the other requirements of this section, as modified by this paragraph, are met. The determination of the limitation on actual expenses under paragraph (b)(9) of this section is made without regard to any services in kind furnished by the Government.
(3)
Permanent change of station.
For purposes of this section, the term
permanent change of station
includes the following situations.
(i) A move from home to the first post of duty when appointed, reappointed, reinstated, or inducted.
(ii) A move from the last post of duty to home or a nearer point in the United States in connection with retirement, discharge, resignation, separation under honorable conditions, transfer, relief from active duty, temporary disability retirement, or transfer to a Fleet Reserve, if such move occurs within 1 year of such termination of active duty or within the period prescribed by the Joint Travel Regulations promulgated under the authority contained in sections 404 through 411 of title 37 of the United States Code.
(iii) A move from one permanent post of duty to another permanent post of duty at a different duty station, even if the member separates from the Armed Forces immediately or shortly after the move.
The term
permanent, post of duty, duty station,
and
honorable
have the meanings given them in appropriate Department of Defense or Department of Transportation rules and regulations.
(4)
Storage expenses.
This paragraph applies to storage expenses as well as to moving expenses described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. the term
storage expenses
means the cost of storing personal effects of members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and their dependents.
(5)
Moves of spouses and dependents.
(i) The following special rule applies for purposes of paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section, if the spouse or dependents of a member of the Armed Forces move to or from a different location than does the member. In this case, the spouse is considered to have commenced work as an employee at a new principal place of work that is within the same general location as the location to which the member moves.
(ii) The following special rule applies for purposes of this paragraph to moves by spouses or dependents of members of the Armed Forces who die, are imprisoned, or desert while on active duty. In these cases, a move to a member's place of enlistment or induction or the member's, spouse's, or dependent's home of record or nearer point in the United States is considered incident to a permanent change of station.
(6)
Disallowance of deduction.
No deduction is allowed under this section for any moving or storage expense reimbursed by an allowance that is excluded from gross income.
(h)
Special rules for foreign moves
—(1)
Increase in limitations.
In the case of a foreign move (as defined in paragraph
(h)(3) of this section), paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall be applied by substituting “90 consecutive” for “30 consecutive” each time it appears. Paragraph (b)(9) (ii), (iii) and (v) of this section shall be applied by substituting “$6,000” for “$3,000” each time it appears and by substituting “$4,500” for “$1,500” each time it appears. Paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section shall be applied by substituting “$5,000” for “$2,000” each time it appears and by substituting “1979” for “1977” and “1980” for “1978” each time they appear in the last sentence. Paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this section shall be applied by substituting “$2,250” for “$750” each time it appears. Paragraph (b)(9)(vi) of this section does not apply.
(2)
Allowance of certain storage fees.
In the case of a foreign move, for purposes of this section, the moving expenses described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall include the reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects to and from storage, and of storing such goods and effects for part or all of the period during which the new place of work continues to be the taxpayer's principal place of work.
(3)
Foreign move.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
foreign move
means a move in connection with the commencement of work by the taxpayer at a new principal place of work located outside the United States. Thus, a move from the United States to a foreign country or from one foreign country to another foreign country qualifies as a foreign move. A move within a foreign country also qualifies as a foreign move. A move from a foreign country to the United States does not qualify as a foreign move.
(4)
United States.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
United States
includes the possessions of the United States.
(5)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph apply to expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. The paragraph also applies to the expenses paid or incurred in the taxable year beginning during 1978 of taxpayers who do not make an election pursuant to section 209(c) of the Foreign Earned Income Act of 1978 (Pub.

(i)
Allowance of deductions in case of retirees or decedents who were working abroad
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any qualified retiree moving expenses or qualified survivor moving expenses, this section (other than paragraph (h)) shall be applied to such expenses as if they were incurred in connection with the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee at a new principal place of work located within the United States and the limitations of paragraph (c)(4) of this section (relating to the minimum period of employment) shall not apply.
(2)
Qualified retiree moving expenses.

qualified retiree moving expenses
means any moving expenses which are incurred by an individual whose former principal place of work and former residence were outside the United States and which are incurred for a move to a new residence in the United States in connection with the bona fide retirement of the individual.
Bona fide retirement
means the permanent withdrawal from gainful full-time employment and self-employment. An individual who at the time of withdrawal from gainful full-time employment or self-employment, intends the withdrawal to be permanent shall be considered to be a
bona fide retiree
even though the individual ultimately resumes gainful full-time employment or self-employment. An individual's intention may be evidenced by relevant facts and circumstances which include the age and health of the individual, the customary retirement age of employees engaged in similar work, whether the individual is receiving a retirement allowance under a pension annuity, retirement or similar fund or system, and the length of time before resuming full-time employment or self-employment.
(3)
Qualified survivor moving expenses.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph, the term
qualified survivor moving expenses
means any moving expenses:
(A) Which are paid or incurred by the spouse or any dependent (as defined in section 152) of any decedent who (as of the time of his death) had a principal place of work outside the United States, and
(B) Which are incurred for a move which begins within 6 months after the death of the decedent and which is to a residence in the United States from a former residence outside the United States which (as of the time of the decedent's death) was the residence of such decedent and the individual paying or incurring the expense.
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (i)(3) (i) (B) of this section, a move begins when:
(A) The taxpayer contracts for the moving of his or her household goods and personal effects to a residence in the United States but only if the move is completed within a reasonable time thereafter;
(B) The taxpayer's household goods and personal effects are packed and in transit to a residence in the United States; or

In general.
A taxpayer who was notified by his employer on or before December 19, 1969, of a transfer to a new principal place of work and who pays or incurs moving expenses after December 31, 1969, but before January 1, 1971, in connection with such transfer may elect to have the rules governing moving expenses in effect prior to the effective date of section 231 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577) govern such expenses. If such election is made, this section and section 82 and the regulations thereunder do not apply to such expenses. A taxpayer is considered to have been notified on or before December 19, 1969, by his employer of a transfer, for example, if before such date the employer has sent a notice to all employees or a reasonably defined group of employees, which includes such taxpayer, of a relocation of the operations of such employer from one plant or facility to another plant or facility. An employee who is transferred to a new principal place of work for the benefit of his employer and who makes an election under this paragraph is permitted to exclude amounts received or accrued, directly or indirectly, as payment for or reimbursement of expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from the former residence to the new residence and of traveling (including meals and lodging) from the former residence to the new place of residence. Such exclusion is limited to amounts received or accrued, directly or indirectly, as a payment for or reimbursement of the expenses described above. Amounts in excess of actual expenses paid or incurred must be included in gross income. No deduction is allowable under section 217 for expenses representing amounts excluded from gross income. Also, an employee who is transferred to a new principal place of work which is less than 50 miles but at least 20 miles farther from his former residence than was his former principal place of work and who is not reimbursed, either directly or indirectly, for the expenses described above is permitted to deduct such expenses providing all of the requirements of section 217 and the regulations thereunder prior to the effective date of section 231 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577) are satisfied.
(ii)
Election made before the date of publication of this notice as a Treasury decision.

(
a
) The items to which the election relates;
(
b
) The amount of each item;
(

§ 1.219-1
Deduction for retirement savings.
(a)
In general.
Subject to the limitations and restrictions of paragraph (b) and the special rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, there shall be allowed a deduction under section 62 from gross income of amounts paid for the taxable year of an individual on behalf of such individual to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a), for an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b), or for a retirement bond described in section 409. The deduction described in the preceding sentence shall be allowed only to the individual on whose behalf such individual retirement account, individual retirement annuity, or retirement bond is maintained. The first sentence of this paragraph shall apply only in the case of a contribution of cash. A contribution of property other than cash is not allowable as a deduction under this section. In the case of a retirement bond, a deduction will not be allowed if the bond is redeemed within 12 months of its issue date.
(b)
Limitations and restrictions
—(1)
Maximum deduction.
The amount allowable as a deduction under section 219(a) to an individual for any taxable year cannot exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of the compensation includible in the gross income of the individual for such taxable year, or $1,500, whichever is less.
(2)
Restrictions
—(i)
Individuals covered by certain other plans.
No deduction is allowable under section 219(a) to an individual for the taxable year if for any part of such year:
(A) He was an active participant in:
(
1
) A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a),
(
2
) An annuity plan described in section 403(a),
(
3
) A qualified bond purchase plan described in section 405(a), or
(
4
) A retirement plan established for its employees by the United States, by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by an agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, or
(B) Amounts were contributed by his employer for an annuity contract described in section 403(b) (whether or
not the individual's rights in such contract are nonforfeitable).
(ii)
Contributions after age 70
1/2
.
No deduction is allowable under section 219 (a) to an individual for the taxable year of the individual, if he has attained the age of 70
1/2
before the close of such taxable year.
(iii)
Rollover contributions.
No deduction is allowable under section 219 for any taxable year of an individual with respect to a rollover contribution described in section 402(a)(5), 402(a)(7), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 409(b)(3)(C).
(3)
Amounts contributed under endowment contracts.
(i) For any taxable year, no deduction is allowable under section 219(a) for amounts paid under an endowment contract described in § 1.408-3(e) which is allocable under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to the cost of life insurance.
(ii) For any taxable year, the cost of current life insurance protection under an endowment contract described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is the product of the net premium cost, as determined by the Commissioner, and the excess, if any, of the death benefit payable under the contract during the policy year beginning in the taxable year over the cash value of the contract at the end of such policy year.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an individual who is otherwise entitled to the maximum deduction allowed under section 219, purchases, at age 20, an endowment contract described in § 1.408-3(e) which provides for the payment of an annuity of $100 per month, at age 65, with a minimum death benefit of $10,000, and an annual premium of $220. The cash value at the end of the first policy year is 0. The net premium cost, as determined by the Commissioner, for A's age is $1.61 per thousand dollars of life insurance protection. The cost of current life insurance protection is $16.10 ($1.61 × 10). A's maximum deduction under section 219 with respect to amounts paid under the endowment contract for the taxable year in which the first policy year begins is $203.90 ($220 − $16.10).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the cash value at the end of the second policy year is $200 and the net premium cost is $1.67 per thousand for A's age. The cost of current life insurance protection is $16.37 ($1.67 × 9.8). A's maximum deduction under section 219 with respect to amounts paid under the endowment contract for the taxable year in which the second policy year begins is $203.63 ($220 − $16.37).
(c)
Definitions and special rules
—(1)
Compensation.
For purposes of this section, the term
compensation
means wages, salaries, professional fees, or other amounts derived from or received for personal service actually rendered (including, but not limited to, commissions paid salesmen, compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips, and bonuses) and includes earned income, as defined in section 401 (c) (2), but does not include amounts derived from or received as earnings or profits from property (including, but not limited to, interest and dividends) or amounts not includible in gross income.
(2)
Active participant.
For the definition of active participant, see § 1.219-2.
(3)
Special rules.
(i) The maximum deduction allowable under section 219(b)(1) is computed separately for each individual. Thus, if a husband and wife each has compensation of $10,000 for the taxable year and they are each otherwise eligible to contribute to an individual retirement account and they file a joint return, then the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 is $3,000, the sum of the individual maximums of $1,500. However, if, for example, the husband has compensation of $20,000, the wife has no compensation, each is otherwise eligible to contribute to an individual retirement account for the taxable year, and they file a joint return, the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 is $1,500.
(ii) Section 219 is to be applied without regard to any community property laws. Thus, if, for example, a husband and wife, who are otherwise eligible to contribute to an individual retirement account, live in a community property jurisdiction and the husband alone has compensation of $20,000 for the taxable year, then the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 is $1,500.
(4)
Employer contributions.
For purposes of this chapter, any amount paid
by an employer to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity or retirement bond constitutes the payment of compensation to the employee (other than a self-employed individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) includible in his gross income, whether or not a deduction for such payment is allowable under section 219 to such employee after the application of section 219(b). Thus, an employer will be entitled to a deduction for compensation paid to an employee for amounts the employer contributes on the employee's behalf to an individual retirement account, for an individual retirement annuity, or for a retirement bond if such deduction is otherwise allowable under section 162.
[T.D. 7714, 45 FR 52788, Aug. 8, 1980]
§ 1.219-2
Definition of active participant.
(a)
In general.
This section defines the term
active participant
for individuals who participate in retirement plans described in section 219(b)(2). Any individual who is an active participant in such a plan is not allowed a deduction under section 219(a) for contributions to an individual retirement account.
(b)
Defined benefit plans
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this paragraph, an individual is an active participant in a defined benefit plan if for any portion of the plan year ending with or within such individual's taxable year he is not excluded under the eligibility provisions of the plan. An individual is not an active participant in a particular taxable year merely because the individual meets the plan's eligibility requirements during a plan year beginning in that particular taxable year but ending in a later taxable year of the individual. However, for purposes of this section, an individual is deemed not to satisfy the eligibility provisions for a particular plan year if his compensation is less than the minimum amount of compensation needed under the plan to accrue a benefit. For example, assume a plan is integrated with Social Security and only those individuals whose compensation exceeds a certain amount accrue benefits under the plan. An individual whose compensation for the plan year ending with or within his taxable year is less than the amount necessary under the plan to accrue a benefit is not an active participant in such plan.
(2)
Rules for plans maintained by more than one employer.
In the case of a defined benefit plan described in section 413(a) and funded at least in part by service-related contributions,
e.g.,
so many cents-per-hour, an individual is an active participant if an employer is contributing or is required to contribute to the plan an amount based on that individual's service taken into account for the plan year ending with or within the individual's taxable year. The general rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies in the case of plans described in section 413(a) and funded only on some non-service-related unit,
e.g.,
so many cents-per-ton of coal.
(3)
Plans in which accruals for all participants have ceased.
In the case of a defined benefit plan in which accruals for all participants have ceased, an individual in such a plan is not an active participant. However, any benefit that may vary with future compensation of an individual provides additional accruals. For example, a plan in which future benefit accruals have ceased, but the actual benefit depends upon final average compensation will not be considered as one in which accruals have ceased.
(4)
No accruals after specified age.
An individual in a defined benefit plan who accrues no additional benefits in a plan year ending with or within such individual's taxable year by reason of attaining a specified age is not an active participant by reason of his participation in that plan.
(c)
Money purchase plan.
An individual is an active participant in a money purchase plan if under the terms of the plan employer contributions must be allocated to the individual's account with respect to the plan year ending with or within the individual's taxable year. This rule applies even if an individual is not employed at any time during the individual's taxable year.
(d)
Profit-sharing and stock-bonus plans
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph applies to profit-sharing and stock
bonus plans. An individual is an active participant in such plans in a taxable year if a forfeiture is allocated to his account as of a date in such taxable year. An individual is also an active participant in a taxable year in such plans if an employer contribution is added to the participant's account in such taxable year. A contribution is added to a participant's account as of the later of the following two dates: the date the contribution is made or the date as of which it is allocated. Thus, if a contribution is made in an individual's taxable year 2 and allocated as of a date in individual's taxable year 1, the later of the relevant dates is the date the contribution is made. Consequently, the individual is an active participant in year 2 but not in year 1 as a result of that contribution.
(2)
Special rule.
An individual is not an active participant for a particular taxable year by reason of a contribution made in such year allocated to a previous year if such individual was an active participant in such previous year by reason of a prior contribution that was allocated as of a date in such previous year.
(e)
Employee contributions.
If an employee makes a voluntary or mandatory contribution to a plan described in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, such employee is an active participant in the plan for the taxable year in which such contribution is made.
(f)
Certain individuals not active participants.
For purposes of this section, an individual is not an active participant under a plan for any taxable year of such individual for which such individual elects, pursuant to the plan, not to participate in such plan.
(g)
Retirement savings for married individuals.
The provisions of this section apply in determining whether an individual or his spouse is an active participant in a plan for purposes of section 220 (relating to retirement savings for certain married individuals).
(h)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Corporation maintains a defined benefit plan which has the following rules on participation and accrual of benefits. Each employee who has attained the age of 25 or has completed one year of service is a participant in the plan. The plan further provides that each participant shall receive upon retirement $12 per month for each year of service in which the employee completes 1,000 hours of service. The plan year is the calendar year. B, a calendar-year taxpayer, enters the plan on January 2, 1980, when he is 27 years of age. Since B has attained the age of 25, he is a participant in the plan. However, B completes less than 1,000 hours of service in 1980 and 1981. Although B is not accruing any benefits under the plan in 1980 and 1981, he is an active participant under section 219(b)(2) because he is a participant in the plan. Thus, B cannot make deductible contributions to an individual retirement arrangement for his taxable years of 1980 and 1981.

# Example 2.
The Y Corporation maintains a profit-sharing plan for its employees. The plan year of the plan is the calendar year. C is a calendar-year taxpayer and a participant in the plan. On June 30, 1980, the employer makes a contribution for 1980 which as allocated on July 31, 1980. In 1981 the employer makes a second contribution for 1980, allocated as of December 31, 1980. Under the general rule stated in § 1.219-2(d)(1), C is an active participant in 1980. Under the special rule stated in § 1.219-2(d)(2), however, C is not an active participant in 1981 by reason of that contribution made in 1981.
(i)
Effective date.
The provisions set forth in this section are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978.
[T.D. 7714, 45 FR 52789, Aug. 8, 1980]
§ 1.221-1
Deduction for interest paid on qualified education loans after December 31, 2001.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Applicability.
Under section 221, an individual taxpayer may deduct from gross income certain interest paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year on a qualified education loan. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for rules on payments of interest by third parties. The rules of this section are applicable to periods governed by section 221 as amended in 2001, which relates to deductions for interest paid on qualified education loans after December 31, 2001, in taxable years ending after December 31, 2001, and on or before December 31, 2010. For rules applicable to interest due and paid on qualified education loans after January 21, 1999, if paid before January 1, 2002, see § 1.221-2. Taxpayers also may apply § 1.221-2 to interest due and paid on
qualified education loans after December 31, 1997, but before January 21, 1999. To the extent that the effective date limitation (sunset) of the 2001 amendment remains in force unchanged, section 221 before amendment in 2001, to which § 1.221-2 relates, also applies to interest due and paid on qualified education loans in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (a). In the example, assume that the institution the student attends is an eligible educational institution, the loan is a qualified education loan, the student is legally obligated to make interest payments under the terms of the loan, and any other applicable requirements, if not otherwise specified, are fulfilled. The example is as follows:

# Example. Effective dates.
Student A begins to make monthly interest payments on her loan beginning January 1, 1997. Student A continues to make interest payments in a timely fashion. However, under the effective date provisions of section 221, no deduction is allowed for interest Student A pays prior to January 1, 1998. Student A may deduct interest due and paid on the loan after December 31, 1997. Student A may apply the rules of § 1.221-2 to interest due and paid during the period beginning January 1, 1998, and ending January 20, 1999. Interest due and paid during the period January 21, 1999, and ending December 31, 2001, is deductible under the rules of § 1.221-2, and interest paid after December 31, 2001, is deductible under the rules of this section.
(b)
Eligibility
—(1)
Taxpayer must have a legal obligation to make interest payments.
A taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section 221 only if the taxpayer has a legal obligation to make interest payments under the terms of the qualified education loan.
(2)
Claimed dependents not eligible
—(i)
In general.
An individual is not entitled to a deduction under section 221 for a taxable year if the individual is a dependent (as defined in section 152) for whom another taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 151 on a Federal income tax return for the same taxable year (or, in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, the taxable year beginning in the same calendar year as the individual's taxable year).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):

# Example 1. Student not claimed as dependent.
Student B pays $750 of interest on qualified education loans during 2003. Student B's parents are not allowed a deduction for her as a dependent for 2003. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student B may deduct under section 221 the $750 of interest paid in 2003.

# Example 2. Student claimed as dependent.
Student C pays $750 of interest on qualified education loans during 2003. Only Student C has the legal obligation to make the payments. Student C's parent claims him as a dependent and is allowed a deduction under section 151 with respect to Student C in computing the parent's 2003 Federal income tax. Student C is not entitled to a deduction under section 221 for the $750 of interest paid in 2003. Because Student C's parent was not legally obligated to make the payments, Student C's parent also is not entitled to a deduction for the interest.
(3)
Married taxpayers.
If a taxpayer is married as of the close of a taxable year, he or she is entitled to a deduction under this section only if the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse file a joint return for that taxable year.
(4)
Payments of interest by a third party
—(i)
In general.
If a third party who is not legally obligated to make a payment of interest on a qualified education loan makes a payment of interest on behalf of a taxpayer who is legally obligated to make the payment, then the taxpayer is treated as receiving the payment from the third party and, in turn, paying the interest.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(4):

# Example 1. Payment by employer.
Student D obtains a qualified education loan to attend college. Upon Student D's graduation from college, Student D works as an intern for a non-profit organization during which time Student D's loan is in deferment and Student D makes no interest payments. As part of the internship program, the non-profit organization makes an interest payment on behalf of Student D after the deferment period. This payment is not excluded from Student D's income under section 108(f) and is treated as additional compensation includible in Student D's gross income. Assuming fulfillment of all other requirements of section 221, Student D may deduct this payment of interest for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 2. Payment by parent.
Student E obtains a qualified education loan to attend college. Upon graduation from college, Student E makes legally required monthly payments of principal and interest. Student E's mother makes a required monthly payment of interest as a gift to Student E. A deduction for Student E as a dependent is not allowed on another taxpayer's tax return for that taxable year. Assuming fulfillment of all other requirements of section 221, Student E may deduct this payment of interest for Federal income tax purposes.
(c)
Maximum deduction.
The amount allowed as a deduction under section 221 for any taxable year may not exceed $2,500.
(d)
Limitation based on modified adjusted gross income
—(1)
In general.
The deduction allowed under section 221 is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $65,000 ($100,000 and $130,000 for married individuals who file a joint return). Section 221 does not allow a deduction for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income of $65,000 or above ($130,000 or above for married individuals who file a joint return). See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for inflation adjustment of amounts in this paragraph (d)(1).
(2)
Modified adjusted gross income defined.
The term
modified adjusted gross income
means the adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62) of the taxpayer for the taxable year increased by any amount excluded from gross income under section 911, 931, or 933 (relating to income earned abroad or from certain United States possessions or Puerto Rico). Modified adjusted gross income must be determined under this section after taking into account the inclusions, exclusions, deductions, and limitations provided by sections 86 (social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits), 135 (redemption of qualified United States savings bonds), 137 (adoption assistance programs), 219 (deductible qualified retirement contributions), and 469 (limitation on passive activity losses and credits), but before taking into account the deductions provided by sections 221 and 222 (qualified tuition and related expenses).
(3)
Inflation adjustment.
For taxable years beginning after 2002, the amounts in paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be increased for inflation occurring after 2001 in accordance with section 221(f)(1). If any amount adjusted under section 221(f)(1) is not a multiple of $5,000, the amount will be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $5,000.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
Eligible educational institution.
In general, an
eligible educational institution
means any college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary educational institution described in section 481 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1088), as in effect on August 5, 1997, and certified by the U.S. Department of Education as eligible to participate in student aid programs administered by the Department, as described in section 25A(f)(2) and § 1.25A-2(b). For purposes of this section, an eligible educational institution also includes an institution that conducts an internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training.
(2)
Qualified higher education expenses
—(i)
In general. Qualified higher education expenses
means the cost of attendance (as defined in section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. 1087ll, as in effect on August 4, 1997), at an eligible educational institution, reduced by the amounts described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Consistent with section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a student's cost of attendance is determined by the eligible educational institution and includes tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload as the student, an allowance for room and board, and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses of the student.
(ii)
Reductions.
Qualified higher education expenses are reduced by any amount that is paid to or on behalf of a student with respect to such expenses and that is—
(A) A qualified scholarship that is excludable from income under section 117;
(B) An educational assistance allowance for a veteran or member of the armed forces under chapter 30, 31, 32, 34 or 35 of title 38, United States Code, or
under chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code;
(C) Employer-provided educational assistance that is excludable from income under section 127;

(F) Any otherwise includible amount distributed from a Coverdell education savings account and excluded from gross income under section 530(d)(2); or
(G) Any otherwise includible amount distributed from a qualified tuition program and excluded from gross income under section 529(c)(3)(B).
(3)
Qualified education loan
—(i)
In general.
A
qualified education loan
means indebtedness incurred by a taxpayer solely to pay qualified higher education expenses that are—
(A) Incurred on behalf of a student who is the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer at the time the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness;
(B) Attributable to education provided during an academic period, as described in section 25A and the regulations thereunder, when the student is an eligible student as defined in section 25A(b)(3) (requiring that the student be a degree candidate carrying at least half the normal full-time workload); and
(C) Paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness.
(ii)
Reasonable period.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), what constitutes a reasonable period of time for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section generally is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. However, qualified higher education expenses are treated as paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness if—
(A) The expenses are paid with the proceeds of education loans that are part of a Federal postsecondary education loan program; or
(B) The expenses relate to a particular academic period and the loan proceeds used to pay the expenses are disbursed within a period that begins 90 days prior to the start of that academic period and ends 90 days after the end of that academic period.
(iii)
Related party.
A qualified education loan does not include any indebtedness owed to a person who is related to the taxpayer, within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). For example, a parent or grandparent of the taxpayer is a related person. In addition, a qualified education loan does not include a loan made under any qualified employer plan as defined in section 72(p)(4) or under any contract referred to in section 72(p)(5).
(iv)
Federal issuance or guarantee not required.
A loan does not have to be issued or guaranteed under a Federal postsecondary education loan program to be a qualified education loan.
(v)
Refinanced and consolidated indebtedness
—(A)
In general.
A qualified education loan includes indebtedness incurred solely to refinance a qualified education loan. A qualified education loan includes a single, consolidated indebtedness incurred solely to refinance two or more qualified education loans of a borrower.
(B)
Treatment of refinanced and consolidated indebtedness.
[Reserved]
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1. Eligible educational institution.
University F is a postsecondary educational institution described in section 481 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The U.S. Department of Education has certified that University F is eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs administered by that Department, although University F chooses not to participate. University F is an eligible educational institution.

# Example 2. Qualified higher education expenses.
Student G receives a $3,000 qualified scholarship for the 2003 fall semester that is excludable from Student G's gross income under section 117. Student G receives no other forms of financial assistance with respect to the 2003 fall semester. Student G's cost of attendance for the 2003 fall semester,
as determined by Student G's eligible educational institution for purposes of calculating a student's financial need in accordance with section 472 of the Higher Education Act, is $16,000. For the 2003 fall semester, Student G has qualified higher education expenses of $13,000 (the cost of attendance as determined by the institution ($16,000) reduced by the qualified scholarship proceeds excludable from gross income ($3,000)).

# Example 3. Qualified education loan.
Student H borrows money from a commercial bank to pay qualified higher education expenses related to his enrollment on a half-time basis in a graduate program at an eligible educational institution. Student H uses all the loan proceeds to pay qualified higher education expenses incurred within a reasonable period of time after incurring the indebtedness. The loan is not federally guaranteed. The commercial bank is not related to Student H within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). Student H's loan is a qualified education loan within the meaning of section 221.

# Example 4. Qualified education loan.
Student I signs a promissory note for a loan on August 15, 2003, to pay for qualified higher education expenses for the 2003 fall and 2004 spring semesters. On August 20, 2003, the lender disburses loan proceeds to Student I's college. The college credits them to Student I's account to pay qualified higher education expenses for the 2003 fall semester, which begins on August 25, 2003. On January 26, 2004, the lender disburses additional loan proceeds to Student I's college. The college credits them to Student I's account to pay qualified higher education expenses for the 2004 spring semester, which began on January 12, 2004. Student I's qualified higher education expenses for the two semesters are paid within a reasonable period of time, as the first loan disbursement occurred within the 90 days prior to the start of the fall 2003 semester and the second loan disbursement occurred during the spring 2004 semester.

# Example 5. Qualified education loan.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except that in 2005 the college is not an eligible educational institution because it loses its eligibility to participate in certain federal financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The qualification of Student I's loan, which was used to pay for qualified higher education expenses for the 2003 fall and 2004 spring semesters, as a qualified education loan is not affected by the college's subsequent loss of eligibility.

# Example 6. Mixed-use loans.
Student J signs a promissory note for a loan secured by Student J's personal residence. Student J will use part of the loan proceeds to pay for certain improvements to Student J's residence and part of the loan proceeds to pay qualified higher education expenses of Student J's spouse. Because Student J obtains the loan not solely to pay qualified higher education expenses, the loan is not a qualified education loan.
(f)
Interest
—(1)
In general.
Amounts paid on a qualified education loan are deductible under section 221 if the amounts are interest for Federal income tax purposes. For example, interest includes—
(i) Qualified stated interest (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)); and
(ii) Original issue discount, which generally includes capitalized interest. For purposes of section 221, capitalized interest means any accrued and unpaid interest on a qualified education loan that, in accordance with the terms of the loan, is added by the lender to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.
(2)
Operative rules for original issue discount
—(i)
In general.
The rules to determine the amount of original issue discount on a loan and the accruals of the discount are in sections 163(e), 1271 through 1275, and the regulations thereunder. In general, original issue discount is the excess of a loan's stated redemption price at maturity (all payments due under the loan other than qualified stated interest payments) over its issue price (the amount loaned). Although original issue discount generally is deductible as it accrues under section 163(e) and § 1.163-7, original issue discount on a qualified education loan is not deductible until paid. See paragraph (f)(3) of this section to determine when original issue discount is paid.
(ii)
Treatment of loan origination fees by the borrower.
If a loan origination fee is paid by the borrower other than for property or services provided by the lender, the fee reduces the issue price of the loan, which creates original issue discount (or additional original issue discount) on the loan in an amount equal to the fee. See § 1.1273-2(g). For an example of how a loan origination fee is taken into account, see
Example 2
of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(3)
Allocation of payments.
See §§ 1.446-2(e) and 1.1275-2(a) for rules on allocating payments between interest and principal. In general, these rules treat a payment first as a payment of interest to the extent of the interest that
has accrued and remains unpaid as of the date the payment is due, and second as a payment of principal. The characterization of a payment as either interest or principal under these rules applies regardless of how the parties label the payment (either as interest or principal). Accordingly, the taxpayer may deduct the portion of a payment labeled as principal that these rules treat as a payment of interest on the loan, including any portion attributable to capitalized interest or loan origination fees.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f). In the examples, assume that the institution the student attends is an eligible educational institution, the loan is a qualified education loan, the student is legally obligated to make interest payments under the terms of the loan, and any other applicable requirements, if not otherwise specified, are fulfilled. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Capitalized interest.
Interest on Student K's loan accrues while Student K is in school, but Student K is not required to make any payments on the loan until six months after he graduates or otherwise leaves school. At that time, the lender capitalizes all accrued but unpaid interest and adds it to the outstanding principal amount of the loan. Thereafter, Student K is required to make monthly payments of interest and principal on the loan. The interest payable on the loan, including the capitalized interest, is original issue discount. See section 1273 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, in determining the total amount of interest paid on the loan each taxable year, Student K may deduct any payments that § 1.1275-2(a) treats as payments of interest, including any principal payments that are treated as payments of capitalized interest. See paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

# Example 2. Allocation of payments.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, in addition, the lender charges Student K a loan origination fee, which is not for any property or services provided by the lender. Under § 1.1273-2(g), the loan origination fee reduces the issue price of the loan, which reduction increases the amount of original issue discount on the loan by the amount of the fee. The amount of original issue discount (which includes the capitalized interest and loan origination fee) that accrues each year is determined under section 1272 and § 1.1272-1. In effect, the loan origination fee accrues over the entire term of the loan. Because the loan has original issue discount, the payment ordering rules in § 1.1275-2(a) must be used to determine how much of each payment is interest for federal tax purposes. See paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Under § 1.1275-2(a), each payment (regardless of its designation by the parties as either interest or principal) generally is treated first as a payment of original issue discount, to the extent of the original issue discount that has accrued as of the date the payment is due and has not been allocated to prior payments, and second as a payment of principal. Therefore, in determining the total amount of interest paid on the qualified education loan for a taxable year, Student K may deduct any payments that the parties label as principal but that are treated as payments of original issue discount under § 1.1275-2(a).
(g)
Additional Rules
—(1)
Payment of interest made during period when interest payment not required.
Payments of interest on a qualified education loan to which this section is applicable are deductible even if the payments are made during a period when interest payments are not required because, for example, the loan has not yet entered repayment status or is in a period of deferment or forbearance.
(2)
Denial of double benefit.
No deduction is allowed under this section for any amount for which a deduction is allowable under another provision of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. No deduction is allowed under this section for any amount for which an exclusion is allowable under section 108(f) (relating to cancellation of indebtedness).
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g). In the examples, assume that the institution the student attends is an eligible educational institution, the loan is a qualified education loan, and the student is legally obligated to make interest payments under the terms of the loan:

# Example 1. Voluntary payment of interest before loan has entered repayment status.
Student L obtains a loan to attend college. The terms of the loan provide that interest accrues on the loan while Student L earns his undergraduate degree but that Student L is not required to begin making payments of interest until six full calendar months after he graduates or otherwise leaves school. Nevertheless, Student L voluntarily pays interest on the loan during 2003, while enrolled in college. Assuming all other relevant requirements are met, Student L is allowed a deduction for interest paid while attending college
even though the payments were made before interest payments were required.

# Example 2. Voluntary payment during period of deferment or forbearance.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that Student L makes no payments on the loan while enrolled in college. Student L graduates in June 2003 and begins making monthly payments of principal and interest on the loan in January 2004, as required by the terms of the loan. In August 2004, Student L enrolls in graduate school on a full-time basis. Under the terms of the loan, Student L may apply for deferment of the loan payments while Student L is enrolled in graduate school. Student L applies for and receives a deferment on the outstanding loan. However, Student L continues to make some monthly payments of interest during graduate school. Student L may deduct interest paid on the loan during the period beginning in January 2004, including interest paid while Student L is enrolled in graduate school.
(h)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to periods governed by section 221 as amended in 2001, which relates to interest paid on a qualified education loan after December 31, 2001, in taxable years ending after December 31, 2001, and on or before December 31, 2010.
[T.D. 9125, 69 FR 25492, May 7, 2004]
§ 1.221-2
Deduction for interest due and paid on qualified education loans before January 1, 2002.
(a)
In general.
Under section 221, an individual taxpayer may deduct from gross income certain interest due and paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year on a qualified education loan. The deduction is allowed only with respect to interest due and paid on a qualified education loan during the first 60 months that interest payments are required under the terms of the loan. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the 60-month rule. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for rules on payments of interest by third parties. The rules of this section are applicable to interest due and paid on qualified education loans after January 21, 1999, if paid before January 1, 2002. Taxpayers also may apply the rules of this section to interest due and paid on qualified education loans after December 31, 1997, but before January 21, 1999. To the extent that the effective date limitation (“sunset”) of the 2001 amendment remains in force unchanged, section 221 before amendment in 2001, to which this section relates, also applies to interest due and paid on qualified education loans in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010. For rules applicable to periods governed by section 221 as amended in 2001, which relates to deductions for interest paid on qualified education loans after December 31, 2001, in taxable years ending after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2011, see § 1.221-1.
(b)
Eligibility
—(1)
Taxpayer must have a legal obligation to make interest payments.
A taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section 221 only if the taxpayer has a legal obligation to make interest payments under the terms of the qualified education loan.
(2)
Claimed dependents not eligible
—(i)
In general.
An individual is not entitled to a deduction under section 221 for a taxable year if the individual is a dependent (as defined in section 152) for whom another taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 151 on a Federal income tax return for the same taxable year (or, in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, the taxable year beginning in the same calendar year as the individual's taxable year).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):

# Example 1. Student not claimed as dependent.
Student A pays $750 of interest on qualified education loans during 1998. Student A's parents are not allowed a deduction for her as a dependent for 1998. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student A may deduct the $750 of interest paid in 1998 under section 221.

# Example 2. Student claimed as dependent.
Student B pays $750 of interest on qualified education loans during 1998. Only Student B has the legal obligation to make the payments. Student B's parent claims him as a dependent and is allowed a deduction under section 151 with respect to Student B in computing the parent's 1998 Federal income tax. Student B may not deduct the $750 of interest paid in 1998 under section 221. Because Student B's parent was not legally obligated to make the payments, Student B's parent also may not deduct the interest.
(3)
Married taxpayers.
If a taxpayer is married as of the close of a taxable year, he or she is entitled to a deduction under this section only if the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse file a joint return for that taxable year.
(4)
Payments of interest by a third party
—(i)
In general.
If a third party who is not legally obligated to make a payment of interest on a qualified education loan makes a payment of interest on behalf of a taxpayer who is legally obligated to make the payment, then the taxpayer is treated as receiving the payment from the third party and, in turn, paying the interest.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(4):

# Example 1. Payment by employer.
Student C obtains a qualified education loan to attend college. Upon Student C's graduation from college, Student C works as an intern for a non-profit organization during which time Student C's loan is in deferment and Student C makes no interest payments. As part of the internship program, the non-profit organization makes an interest payment on behalf of Student C after the deferment period. This payment is not excluded from Student C's income under section 108(f) and is treated as additional compensation includible in Student C's gross income. Assuming fulfillment of all other requirements of section 221, Student C may deduct this payment of interest for Federal income tax purposes.

# Example 2. Payment by parent.
Student D obtains a qualified education loan to attend college. Upon graduation from college, Student D makes legally required monthly payments of principal and interest. Student D's mother makes a required monthly payment of interest as a gift to Student D. A deduction for Student D as a dependent is not allowed on another taxpayer's tax return for that taxable year. Assuming fulfillment of all other requirements of section 221, Student D may deduct this payment of interest for Federal income tax purposes.
(c)
Maximum deduction.
In any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2002, the amount allowed as a deduction under section 221 may not exceed the amount determined in accordance with the following table:
Taxable year beginning in
Maximum deduction
1998
$1,000
1999
1,500
2000
2,000
2001
2,500
(d)
Limitation based on modified adjusted gross income
—(1)
In general.
The deduction allowed under section 221 is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $40,000 and $55,000 ($60,000 and $75,000 for married individuals who file a joint return). Section 221 does not allow a deduction for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income of $55,000 or above ($75,000 or above for married individuals who file a joint return).
(2)
Modified adjusted gross income defined.
The term
modified adjusted gross income
means the adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62) of the taxpayer for the taxable year increased by any amount excluded from gross income under section 911, 931, or 933 (relating to income earned abroad or from certain United States possessions or Puerto Rico). Modified adjusted gross income must be determined under this section after taking into account the inclusions, exclusions, deductions, and limitations provided by sections 86 (social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits), 135 (redemption of qualified United States savings bonds), 137 (adoption assistance programs), 219 (deductible qualified retirement contributions), and 469 (limitation on passive activity losses and credits), but before taking into account the deduction provided by section 221.
(e)
60-month rule
—(1)
In general.
A deduction for interest paid on a qualified education loan is allowed only for payments made during the first 60 months that interest payments are required on the loan. The 60-month period begins on the first day of the month that includes the date on which interest payments are first required and ends 60 months later, unless the 60-month period is suspended for periods of deferment or forbearance within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The 60-month period continues to run regardless of whether the required interest payments are actually made. The date on which the first interest payment is required is determined under the terms of the loan agreement or, in the case of a loan issued or guaranteed under a federal postsecondary education loan program (such as loan programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070) and titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292., and 42 U.S.C. 296)) under applicable Federal regulations. For a discussion of interest, see paragraph (h) of this section.
For special rules relating to loan refinancings, consolidated loans, and collapsed loans, see paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Loans that entered repayment status prior to January 1, 1998.
In the case of any qualified education loan that entered repayment status prior to January 1, 1998, section 221 allows no deduction for interest paid during the portion of the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section that occurred prior to January 1, 1998. Section 221 allows a deduction only for interest due and paid during that portion, if any, of the 60-month period remaining after December 31, 1997.
(3)
Periods of deferment or forbearance.
The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section generally is suspended for any period when interest payments are not required on a qualified education loan because the lender has granted the taxpayer a period of deferment or forbearance (including postponement in anticipation of cancellation). However, in the case of a qualified education loan that is not issued or guaranteed under a Federal postsecondary education loan program, the 60-month period will be suspended under this paragraph (e)(3) only if the promissory note contains conditions substantially similar to the conditions for deferment or forbearance established by the U.S. Department of Education for Federal student loan programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, such as half-time study at a postsecondary educational institution, study in an approved graduate fellowship program or in an approved rehabilitation program for the disabled, inability to find full-time employment, economic hardship, or the performance of services in certain occupations or federal programs, and the borrower satisfies one of those conditions. For any qualified education loan, the 60-month period is not suspended if under the terms of the loan interest continues to accrue while the loan is in deferment or forbearance and either—
(i) In the case of deferment, the taxpayer agrees to pay interest currently during the deferment period; or
(ii) In the case of forbearance, the taxpayer agrees to make reduced payments, or payments of interest only, during the forbearance period.
(4)
Late payments.
A deduction is allowed for a payment of interest required in one month but actually made in a subsequent month prior to the expiration of the 60-month period. A deduction is not allowed for a payment of interest required in one month but actually made in a subsequent month after the expiration of the 60-month period. A late payment made during a period of deferment or forbearance is treated, solely for purposes of determining whether it is made during the 60-month period, as made on the date it is due.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e). In the examples, assume that the institution the student attends is an eligible educational institution, the loan is a qualified education loan and is issued or guaranteed under a federal postsecondary education loan program, the student is legally obligated to make interest payments under the terms of the loan, the interest payments occur after December 31, 1997, but before January 1, 2002, and with respect to any period after December 31, 1997, but before January 21, 1999, the taxpayer elects to apply the rules of this section. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Payment prior to 60-month period.
Student E obtains a loan to attend college. The terms of the loan provide that interest accrues on the loan while Student E earns his undergraduate degree but that Student E is not required to begin making payments of interest until six full calendar months after he graduates. Nevertheless, Student E voluntarily pays interest on the loan while attending college. Student E is not allowed a deduction for interest paid during that period, because those payments were made prior to the start of the 60-month period. Similarly, Student E would not be allowed a deduction for any interest paid during the six month grace period after graduation when interest payments are not required.

# Example 2. Deferment option not exercised.
The facts are the same as in
Example
1 except that Student E makes no payments on the loan while enrolled in college. Student E graduates in June 1999, and is required to begin making monthly payments of principal and interest on the loan in January 2000. The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins in January 2000. In August 2000, Student E enrolls in graduate
school on a full-time basis. Under the terms of the loan, Student E may apply for deferment of the loan payments while enrolled in graduate school. However, Student E elects not to apply for deferment and continues to make required monthly payments on the loan during graduate school. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student E may deduct interest paid on the loan during the 60-month period beginning in January 2000, including interest paid while enrolled in graduate school.

# Example 3. Late payment, within 60-month period.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that, after the loan enters repayment status in January 2000, Student E makes no interest payments until March 2000. In March 2000, Student E pays interest required for the months of January, February, and March 2000. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student E may deduct the interest paid in March for the months of January, February, and March because the interest payments are required under the terms of the loan and are paid within the 60-month period, even though the January and February interest payments may be late.

# Example 4. Late payment during deferment but within 60-month period.
The terms of Student F's loan require her to begin making monthly payments of interest on the loan in January 2000. The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins in January 2000. Student F fails to make the required interest payments for the months of November and December 2000. In January 2001, Student F enrolls in graduate school on a half-time basis. Under the terms of the loan, Student F obtains a deferment of the loan payments due while enrolled in graduate school. The deferment becomes effective January 1, 2001. In March 2001, while the loan is in deferment, Student F pays the interest due for the months of November and December 2000. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student F may deduct interest paid in March 2001, for the months of November and December 2000, because the late interest payments are treated, solely for purposes of determining whether they were made during the 60-month period, as made in November and December 2000.

# Example 5. 60-month period.
The terms of Student G's loan require him to begin making monthly payments of interest on the loan in November 1999. The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins in November 1999. In January 2000, Student G enrolls in graduate school on a half-time basis. As permitted under the terms of the loan, Student G applies for deferment of the loan payments due while enrolled in graduate school. While awaiting formal approval from the lender of his request for deferment, Student G pays interest due for the month of January 2000. In February 2000, the lender approves Student G's request for deferment, effective as of January 1, 2000. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student G may deduct interest paid in January 2000, prior to his receipt of the lender's approval, even though the deferment was retroactive to January 1, 2000. As of February 2000, there are 57 months remaining in the 60-month period for that loan. Because Student G is not required to make interest payments during the period of deferment, the 60-month period is suspended. After January 2000, Student G may not deduct any voluntary payments of interest made during the period of deferment.

# Example 6. 60-month period.
The terms of Student H's loan require her to begin making monthly payments of interest on the loan in November 1999. The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins in November 1999. In January 2000, Student H enrolls in graduate school on a half-time basis. As permitted under the terms of the loan, Student H applies to make reduced payments of principal and interest while enrolled in graduate school. After the lender approves her application, Student H pays principal and interest due for the month of January 2000 at the reduced rate. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, Student H may deduct interest paid in January 2000. As of February 2000, there are 57 months remaining in the 60-month period for that loan.

# Example 7. Reduction of 60-month period for months prior to January 1, 1998.
The first payment of interest on a loan is due in January 1997. Thereafter, interest payments are required on a monthly basis. The 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for this loan begins on January 1, 1997, the first day of the month that includes the date on which the first interest payment is required. However, the borrower may not deduct interest paid prior to January 1, 1998, under the effective date provisions of section 221. Assuming fulfillment of all other relevant requirements, the borrower may deduct interest due and paid on the loan during the 48 months beginning on January 1, 1998 (unless such period is extended for periods of deferment or forbearance under paragraph (e)(3) of this section).

Consistent with section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a student's cost of attendance is determined by the eligible educational institution and includes tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload as the student, an allowance for room and board, and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses of the student.
(ii)
Reductions.
Qualified higher education expenses are reduced by any amount that is paid to or on behalf of a student with respect to such expenses and that is—
(A) A qualified scholarship that is excludable from income under section 117;
(B) An educational assistance allowance for a veteran or member of the armed forces under chapter 30, 31, 32, 34 or 35 of title 38, United States Code, or under chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code;

(F) Any otherwise includible amount distributed from a Coverdell education savings account and excluded from gross income under section 530(d)(2).
(3)
Qualified education loan
—(i)
In general.
A
qualified education loan
means indebtedness incurred by a taxpayer solely to pay qualified higher education expenses that are—
(A) Incurred on behalf of a student who is the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer at the time the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness;
(B) Attributable to education provided during an academic period, as described in section 25A and the regulations thereunder, when the student is an eligible student as defined in section 25A(b)(3) (requiring that the student be a degree candidate carrying at least half the normal full-time workload); and
(C) Paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness.
(ii)
Reasonable period.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(3)(ii), what constitutes a reasonable period of time for purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(i)(C) of this section generally is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. However, qualified higher education expenses are treated as paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the taxpayer incurs the indebtedness if—
(A) The expenses are paid with the proceeds of education loans that are part of a federal postsecondary education loan program; or
(B) The expenses relate to a particular academic period and the loan proceeds used to pay the expenses are disbursed within a period that begins 90 days prior to the start of that academic period and ends 90 days after the end of that academic period.
(iii)
Related party.
A qualified education loan does not include any indebtedness owed to a person who is related to the taxpayer, within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). For example, a parent or grandparent of the taxpayer is a related person. In addition, a qualified education loan does not include a loan made under any qualified employer plan as defined in section 72(p)(4) or under any contract referred to in section 72(p)(5).
(iv)
Federal issuance or guarantee not required.
A loan does not have to be
issued or guaranteed under a federal postsecondary education loan program to be a qualified education loan.
(v)
Refinanced and consolidated indebtedness
—(A) In
general.
A qualified education loan includes indebtedness incurred solely to refinance a qualified education loan. A qualified education loan includes a single, consolidated indebtedness incurred solely to refinance two or more qualified education loans of a borrower.
(B)
Treatment of refinanced and consolidated indebtedness.
[Reserved]
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f):

# Example 1. Eligible educational institution.
University J is a postsecondary educational institution described in section 481 of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The U.S. Department of Education has certified that University J is eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs administered by that Department, although University J chooses not to participate. University J is an eligible educational institution.

# Example 2. Qualified higher education expenses.
Student K receives a $3,000 qualified scholarship for the 1999 fall semester that is excludable from Student K's gross income under section 117. Student K receives no other forms of financial assistance with respect to the 1999 fall semester. Student K's cost of attendance for the 1999 fall semester, as determined by Student K's eligible educational institution for purposes of calculating a student's financial need in accordance with section 472 of the Higher Education Act, is $16,000. For the 1999 fall semester, Student K has qualified higher education expenses of $13,000 (the cost of attendance as determined by the institution ($16,000) reduced by the qualified scholarship proceeds excludable from gross income ($3,000)).

# Example 3. Qualified education loan.
Student L borrows money from a commercial bank to pay qualified higher education expenses related to his enrollment on a half-time basis in a graduate program at an eligible educational institution. Student L uses all the loan proceeds to pay qualified higher education expenses incurred within a reasonable period of time after incurring the indebtedness. The loan is not federally guaranteed. The commercial bank is not related to Student L within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). Student L's loan is a qualified education loan within the meaning of section 221.

# Example 4. Qualified education loan.
Student M signs a promissory note for a loan on August 15, 1999, to pay for qualified higher education expenses for the 1999 fall and 2000 spring semesters. On August 20, 1999, the lender disburses loan proceeds to Student M's college. The college credits them to Student M's account to pay qualified higher education expenses for the 1999 fall semester, which begins on August 23, 1999. On January 25, 2000, the lender disburses additional loan proceeds to Student M's college. The college credits them to Student M's account to pay qualified higher education expenses for the 2000 spring semester, which began on January 10, 2000. Student M's qualified higher education expenses for the two semesters are paid within a reasonable period of time, as the first loan disbursement occurred within the 90 days prior to the start of the fall 1999 semester, and the second loan disbursement occurred during the spring 2000 semester.

# Example 5. Qualified education loan.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that in 2001 the college is not an eligible educational institution because it loses its eligibility to participate in certain federal financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The qualification of Student M's loan, which was used to pay for qualified higher education expenses for the 1999 fall and 2000 spring semesters, as a qualified education loan is not affected by the college's subsequent loss of eligibility.

# Example 6. Mixed-use loans.
Student N signs a promissory note for a loan that is secured by Student N's personal residence. Student N will use part of the loan proceeds to pay for certain improvements to Student N's residence and part of the loan proceeds to pay qualified higher education expenses of Student N's spouse. Because Student N obtains the loan not solely to pay qualified higher education expenses, the loan is not a qualified education loan.
(g)
Denial of double benefit.
No deduction is allowed under this section for any amount for which a deduction is allowable under another provision of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. No deduction is allowed under this section for any amount for which an exclusion is allowable under section 108(f) (relating to cancellation of indebtedness).
(h)
Interest
—(1)
In general.
Amounts paid on a qualified education loan are deductible under section 221 if the amounts are interest for Federal income tax purposes. For example, interest includes—
(i) Qualified stated interest (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)); and
(ii) Original issue discount, which generally includes capitalized interest. For purposes of section 221, capitalized interest means any accrued and unpaid
interest on a qualified education loan that, in accordance with the terms of the loan, is added by the lender to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.
(2)
Operative rules for original issue discount
—(i)
In general.
The rules to determine the amount of original issue discount on a loan and the accruals of the discount are in sections 163(e), 1271 through 1275, and the regulations thereunder. In general, original issue discount is the excess of a loan's stated redemption price at maturity (all payments due under the loan other than qualified stated interest payments) over its issue price (the amount loaned). Although original issue discount generally is deductible as it accrues under section 163(e) and § 1.163-7, original issue discount on a qualified education loan is not deductible until paid. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section to determine when original issue discount is paid.
(ii)
Treatment of loan origination fees by the borrower.
If a loan origination fee is paid by the borrower other than for property or services provided by the lender, the fee reduces the issue price of the loan, which creates original issue discount (or additional original issue discount) on the loan in an amount equal to the fee. See § 1.1273-2(g). For an example of how a loan origination fee is taken into account, see
Example 2
of paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(3)
Allocation of payments.
See §§ 1.446-2(e) and 1.1275-2(a) for rules on allocating payments between interest and principal. In general, these rules treat a payment first as a payment of interest to the extent of the interest that has accrued and remains unpaid as of the date the payment is due, and second as a payment of principal. The characterization of a payment as either interest or principal under these rules applies regardless of how the parties label the payment (either as interest or principal). Accordingly, the taxpayer may deduct the portion of a payment labeled as principal that these rules treat as a payment of interest on the loan, including any portion attributable to capitalized interest or loan origination fees.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (h). In the examples, assume that the institution the student attends is an eligible educational institution, the loan is a qualified education loan, the student is legally obligated to make interest payments under the terms of the loan, and any other applicable requirements, if not otherwise specified, are fulfilled. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Capitalized interest.
Interest on Student O's qualified education loan accrues while Student O is in school, but Student O is not required to make any payments on the loan until six months after he graduates or otherwise leaves school. At that time, the lender capitalizes all accrued but unpaid interest and adds it to the outstanding principal amount of the loan. Thereafter, Student O is required to make monthly payments of interest and principal on the loan. The interest payable on the loan, including the capitalized interest, is original issue discount. Therefore, in determining the total amount of interest paid on the qualified education loan during the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, Student O may deduct any payments that § 1.1275-2(a) treats as payments of interest, including any principal payments that are treated as payments of capitalized interest. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

# Example 2. Allocation of payments.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (h)(4), except that, in addition, the lender charges Student O a loan origination fee, which is not for any property or services provided by the lender. Under § 1.1273-2(g), the loan origination fee reduces the issue price of the loan, which reduction increases the amount of original issue discount on the loan by the amount of the fee. The amount of original issue discount (which includes the capitalized interest and loan origination fee) that accrues each year is determined under section § 1272 and § 1.1272-1. In effect, the loan origination fee accrues over the entire term of the loan. Because the loan has original issue discount, the payment ordering rules in § 1.1275-2(a) must be used to determine how much of each payment is interest for federal tax purposes. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Under § 1.1275-2(a), each payment (regardless of its designation by the parties as either interest or principal) generally is treated first as a payment of original issue discount, to the extent of the original issue discount that has accrued as of the date the payment is due and has not been allocated to prior payments, and second as a payment of principal. Therefore, in determining the
total amount of interest paid on the qualified education loan during the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, Student O may deduct any payments that the parties label as principal but that are treated as payments of original issue discount under § 1.1275-2(a). The 60-month period does not begin in the month in which the lender charges Student O the loan origination fee.
(i)
Special rules regarding 60-month limitation
—(1)
Refinancing.
A qualified education loan and all indebtedness incurred solely to refinance that loan constitute a single loan for purposes of calculating the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(2)
Consolidated loans.
A consolidated loan is a single loan that refinances more than one qualified education loan of a borrower. For consolidated loans, the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins on the latest date on which any of the underlying loans entered repayment status and includes any subsequent month in which the consolidated loan is in repayment status.
(3)
Collapsed loans.
A collapsed loan is two or more qualified education loans of a single taxpayer that constitute a single qualified education loan for loan servicing purposes and for which the lender or servicer does not separately account. For a collapsed loan, the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins on the latest date on which any of the underlying loans entered repayment status and includes any subsequent month in which any of the underlying loans is in repayment status.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (i):

# Example 1. Refinancing.
Student P obtains a qualified education loan to pay for an undergraduate degree at an eligible educational institution. After graduation, Student P is required to make monthly interest payments on the loan beginning in January 2000. Student P makes the required interest payments for 15 months. In April 2001, Student P borrows money from another lender exclusively to repay the first qualified education loan. The new loan requires interest payments to start immediately. At the time Student P must begin interest payments on the new loan, which is a qualified education loan, there are 45 months remaining of the original 60-month period referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

# Example 2. Collapsed loans.
To finance his education, Student Q obtains four separate qualified education loans from Lender R. The loans enter repayment status, and their respective 60-month periods described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begin, in July, August, September, and December of 1999. After all of Student Q's loans have entered repayment status, Lender R informs Student Q that Lender R will transfer all four loans to Lender S. Following the transfer, Lender S treats the loans as a single loan for loan servicing purposes. Lender S sends Student Q a single statement that shows the total principal and interest, and does not keep separate records with respect to each loan. With respect to the single collapsed loan, the 60-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section begins in December 1999.
(j)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to interest due and paid on qualified education loans after January 21, 1999, if paid before January 1, 2002. Taxpayers also may apply this section to interest due and paid on qualified education loans after December 31, 1997, but before January 21, 1999. This section also applies to interest due and paid on qualified education loans in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2010.

# Special Deductions for Corporations
§ 1.241-1
Allowance of special deductions.
A corporation, in computing its taxable income, is allowed as deductions the items specified in Part VIII (section 242 and following), Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code, in addition to the deductions provided in part VI (section 161 and following) Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code.
§ 1.242-1
Deduction for partially tax-exempt interest.
A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 242(a) in an amount equal to certain interest received on obligations of the United States, or an obligation of corporations organized under Acts of Congress which are instrumentalities of the United States. The interest for which a deduction shall be allowed is interest which is included in gross income and which is exempt from normal tax under the act, as amended
and supplemented, which authorized the issuance of the obligations. The deduction allowed by section 242(a) is allowed only for the purpose of computing normal tax, and therefore, no deduction is allowed for such interest in the computation of any surtax imposed by Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
[T.D. 7100, 36 FR 5333, Mar. 20, 1971]
§ 1.243-1
Deduction for dividends received by corporations.
(a)(1) A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 243 for dividends received from a domestic corporation which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(2) Except as provided in section 243(c) and in section 246, the deduction is:
(i) For the taxable year, an amount equal to 85 percent of the dividends received from such domestic corporations during the taxable year (other than dividends to which subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph applies).
(ii) For a taxable year beginning after September 2, 1958, an amount equal to 100 percent of the dividends received from such domestic corporations if at the time of receipt of such dividends the recipient corporation is a Federal licensee under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. ch. 14B). However, to claim the deduction provided by section 243(a)(2) the company must file with its return a statement that it was a Federal licensee under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 at the time of the receipt of the dividends.
(iii) For a taxable year ending after December 31, 1963, an amount equal to 100 percent of the dividends received which are
qualifying dividends,
as defined in section 243(b) and § 1.243-4.
(3) To determine the amount of the distribution to a recipient corporation and the amount of the dividend, see §§ 1.301-1 and 1.316-1.
(b) For limitation on the dividends received deduction, see section 246 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 817, Jan. 18, 1969]
§ 1.243-2
Special rules for certain distributions.
(a)
Dividends paid by mutual savings banks, etc.
In determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), any amount allowed as a deduction under section 591 (relating to deduction for dividends paid by mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, and domestic building and loan associations) shall not be considered as a dividend.
(b)
Dividends received from regulated investment companies.
In determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), dividends received from a regulated investment company shall be subject to the limitations provided in section 854.
(c)
Dividends received from real estate investment trusts.
See section 857(c) and paragraph (d) of § 1.857-6 for special rules which deny a deduction under section 243 in the case of dividends received from a real estate investment trust with respect to a taxable year for which such trust is taxable under Part II, Subchapter M, Chapter 1 of the Code.
(d)
Dividends received on preferred stock of a public utility.
The deduction allowed by section 243(a) shall be determined without regard to any dividends described in section 244 (relating to dividends on the preferred stock of a public utility). That is, such deduction shall be determined without regard to any dividends received on the preferred stock of a public utility which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code and with respect to which a deduction is allowed by section 247 (relating to dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public utilities). For a deduction with respect to such dividends received on the preferred stock of a public utility, see section 244. If a deduction for dividends paid is not allowable to the distributing corporation under section 247 with respect to the dividends on its preferred stock, such dividends received from a domestic public utility corporation subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code are includible in determining the deduction allowed by section 243(a).
[T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4092, Apr. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6992, 34 FR 817, Jan. 18, 1969; T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11264, Feb. 6, 1981]
§ 1.243-3
Certain dividends from foreign corporations.
(a)
In general.
(1) In determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), section 243(d) provides that a dividend received from a foreign corporation after December 31, 1959, shall be treated as a dividend from a domestic corporation which is subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code, but only to the extent that such dividend is out of earnings and profits accumulated by a domestic corporation during a period with respect to which such domestic corporation was subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law). Thus, for example, if a domestic corporation accumulates earnings and profits during a period or periods with respect to which it is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law) and subsequently such domestic corporation reincorporates in a foreign country, any dividends paid out of such earnings and profits after such reincorporation are eligible for the deduction provided in section 243(a) (1) and (2).
(2) Section 243(d) and this section do not apply to dividends paid out of earnings and profits accumulated (i) by a corporation organized under the China Trade Act, 1922, (ii) by a domestic corporation during any period with respect to which such corporation was exempt from taxation under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc. organizations) or 521 (relating to farmers' cooperative associations), or (iii) by a domestic corporation during any period to which section 931 (relating to income from sources within possessions of the United States), as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, applied.
(b)
Establishing separate earnings and profits accounts.
A foreign corporation shall, for purposes of section 243(d), maintain a separate account for earnings and profits to which it succeeds which were accumulated by a domestic corporation, and such foreign corporation shall treat such earnings and profits as having been accumulated during the accounting periods in which earned by such domestic corporation. Such foreign corporation shall also maintain such a separate account for the earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, accumulated by it or accumulated by any other corporations to the earnings and profits of which it succeeds.
(c)
Effect of dividends on earnings and profits accounts.
Dividends paid out of the accumulated earnings and profits (see section 316(a)(1) of such foreign corporation shall be treated as having been paid out of the most recently accumulated earnings and profits of such corporation. A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any accounting period shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a prior accounting period in such account. If there are no accumulated earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a deficit incurred in a prior accounting period, such deficit must be restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent accounting period. If a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits of a foreign corporation which maintains two or more accounts (established under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) with respect to two or more accounting periods ending on the same day, then the portion of such dividend considered as paid out of each account shall be the same proportion of the total dividend as the amount of earnings and profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings and profits in all such accounts.
(d)
Illustration.
The application of the principles of this section in the determination of the amount of the dividends received deduction may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On December 31, 1960, corporation X, a calendar-year corporation organized in the United States on January 1, 1958, consolidated with corporation Y, a foreign corporation organized on January 1, 1958, which used an annual accounting period based on the calendar year, to form corporation Z, a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the United States. Corporation Z is a wholly-owned subsidiary of corporation M, a domestic corporation. On January 1, 1961, corporation Z's accumulated earnings and profits of $31,000 are, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, maintained in separate earnings and profits accounts containing the following amounts:
Earnings and profits accumulated for—
Domestic corp. X
Foreign corp. Y
1958
($1,000)
$11,000
1959
10,000
9,000
1960
5,000
(3,000)
Corporation Z had earnings and profits of $10,000 in each of the years 1961, 1962, and 1963 and makes distributions with respect to its stock to corporation M for such years in the following amounts:
1961
$14,000
1962
23,000
1963
16,000
(1) For 1961, a deduction of $3,400 is allowable to M with respect to the $14,000 distribution from Z, computed as follows:
(i) Dividend from current year earnings and profits (1961)
$10,000
(ii) Dividend from earnings and profits of corporation X accumulated for 1960
4,000

§ 1.243-4
Qualifying dividends.
(a)
Definition of qualifying dividends
—(1)
General.
For purposes of section 243(a)(3), the term
qualifying dividends
means dividends received by a corporation if:
(i) At the close of the day the dividends are received, such corporation is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) as the corporation distributing the dividends,
(ii) An election by such affiilated group under section 243(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section is effective for the taxable years of its members which include such day, and
(iii) The dividends are distributed out of earnings and profits specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Earnings and profits.
The earnings and profits specified in this subparagraph are earnings and profits of a taxable year of the distributing corporation (or a predecessor corporation) which satisfies each of the following conditions:
(i) Such year must end after December 31, 1963;
(ii) On each day of such year the distributing corporation (or the predecessor corporation) and the corporation receiving the dividends must have been members of the affiliated group of which the distributing corporation and the corporation receiving the dividends are members on the day the dividends are received; and
(iii) An election under section 1562 (relating to the election of multiple surtax exmptions) was never effective (or is no longer effective pursuant to section 1562(c)) for such year.
(3)
Special rule for insurance companies.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if an insurance company subject to taxation under section 802 or 821 distributes a dividend out of earnings and profits of a taxable year with respect to which the company would have been a component member of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning of section 1563 were it not for the application of section 1563(b)(2)(D), such dividend shall not be treated as a qualifying dividend unless an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for such taxable year.
(4)
Predecessor corporations.
For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation shall be considered to be a predecessor corporation with respect to a distributing corporation if the distributing corporation succeeds to the earnings and profits of such corporation, for example, as the result of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. A distributing corporation shall, for purposes of this section, maintain, in respect of each predecessor corporation, a separate account for earnings and profits to which it succeeds, and such earnings and profits shall be considered to be earnings and profits of the predecessor's taxable year in which the earnings and profits were accumulated.
(5)
Mere change in form.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the affiliated group in existence during the taxable year out of the earnings and profits of which the dividend is distributed shall not be considered as a different group from that in existence on the day on which the dividend is received merely because:
(
a
) The common parent corporation has undergone a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization (within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(F)), or
(
b
) A newly organized corporation (the “acquiring corporation”) has acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of the common parent corporation (the “acquired corporation”) solely in exchange for stock of such acquiring corporation, and the stockholders (immediately before the acquisition) of the acquired corporation, as a result of owning stock of the acquired corporation, own (immediately after the acquisition) all of the outstanding stock of the acquiring corporation.
If a transaction described in the preceding sentence has occurred, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the entire period during which the acquired corporation was a member of such group.
(ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) (b) of this subparagraph, if immediately before the acquisition:
(
a
) The stockholders of the acquired corporation also owned all of the outstanding stock of another corporation (the “second corporation”), and
(
b
) Stock of the acquired corporation and of the second corporation could be acquired or transferred only as a unit (hereinafter referred to as the “limitation on transferability”), then the second corporation shall be treated as an acquired corporation and such second corporation shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the entire period (while such group was in existence) during which the limitation on transferability was in existence, and if the second corporation is itself the common parent corporation of an affiliated group (the “second group”) any other member of the second group shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the entire period during which it was a member of the second group while the limitation on transferability existed. For purposes of (
a
) of this subdivision and subdivision (i)(
b
) of this subparagraph, if the limitation on transferability of stock of the acquired corporation and the second corporation is achieved by using a voting trust, then the stock owned by the trust shall be considered as owned by the holders of the beneficial interests in the trust.
(6)
Source of distributions.
In determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend is treated as having been distributed for purposes of this section, the principles of paragraph (a) of § 1.316-2 shall apply. A dividend shall be considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which includes the date the dividend is distributed, second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable year, third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year, etc. A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any taxable year shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a prior year in such account. If there are no accumulated earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a deficit incurred in a prior year, such deficit must be restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent year. If
a dividend is distributed out of separate earnings and profits accounts (established under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) for two or more taxable years ending on the same day, then the portion of such dividend considered as distributed out of each account shall be the same proportion of the total dividend as the amount of earnings and profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings and profits in all such accounts.
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 1, 1965, corporation P, a publicly owned corporation, acquires all of the stock of corporation S and continues to hold the stock throughout the remainder of 1965 and all of 1966. P and S are domestic corporations which file separate returns on the basis of a calendar year. The affiliated group consisting of P and S makes an election under section 243(b)(2) which is effective for the 1966 taxable years of P and S. A multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562 is not effective for their 1965 taxable years. On February 1, 1966, S distributes $50,000 with respect to its stock which is received by P on the same date. S had earnings and profits of $40,000 for 1966 (computed without regard to distributions during 1966). S also had earnings and profits accumulated for 1965 of $70,000. Since $40,000 was distributed out of earnings and profits for 1966 and since each of the conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is satisfied, P is entitled to a 100-percent dividends received deduction with respect to $40,000 of the $50,000 distribution. However, since $10,000 was distributed out of earnings and profits accumulated for 1965, and since on each day of 1965 S and P were not members of the affiliated group of which S and P were members on February 1, 1966, $10,000 of the $50,000 distribution does not satisfy the condition specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph and thus does not qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 1965, and sells such stock on November 1, 1966. Since $10,000 is distributed out of earnings and profits for 1965, and since each of the conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is satisfied, P is entitled to a 100-percent dividends received deduction with respect to $10,000 of the $50,000 distribution. However, since $40,000 of the $50,000 distribution was made out of earnings and profits of S for its 1966 taxable year, and on each day of such year S and P were not members of the affiliated group of which S and P were members on February 1, 1966, $40,000 of the distribution does not satisfy the condition specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph and thus does not qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 1965, and that a multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562 is effective for P's and S's 1965 taxable years. Further assume that the section 1562 election is terminated effective with respect to their 1966 taxable years, and that an election under section 243(b) (2) is effective for such taxable years. Since $10,000 of the February 1, 1966, distribution was made out of earnings and profits of S for its 1965 taxable year and since a multiple surtax exemption election is effective for such year, $10,000 of the distribution does not satisfy the condition specified in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph and thus does not qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction. However, the portion of the distribution which was distributed out of earnings and profits of S's 1966 year ($40,000) qualifies for the 100-percent dividends received deduction.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 1965, and that S is a life insurance company subject to taxation under section 802. Accordingly, S would have been a member of a controlled group of corporations except for the application of section 1563(b)(2)(D). Since $10,000 of the distribution was made out of earnings and profits of S for its 1965 taxable year, and since with respect to such year an election under section 243(b)(2) was not effective, $10,000 of the distribution is not a qualifying dividend by reason of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. On the other hand, the portion of the distribution which was distributed out of earnings and profits for S's 1966 year ($40,000) does qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction because the distribution was out of earnings and profits of a year for which an election under section 243(b) (2) is effective, and because the other conditions specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are satisfied. However, if P were also a life insurance company subject to taxation under section 802, then subparagraph (3) of this paragraph would not result in the disqualification of the portion of the distribution made out of S's 1965 earnings and profits because S would be a component member of an insurance group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a)(4)), consisting of P and S, with respect to its 1965 year.

# Example 5.
Corporation X owns all the stock of corporation Y from January 1, 1965,
through December 31, 1969. X and Y are domestic corporations which file separate returns on the basis of a calendar year. On June 30, 1965, Y acquired all the stock of domestic corporation Z, a calendar year taxpayer, and on December 31, 1967, Y acquired the assets of Z in a transaction to which section 381(a) applied. A multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562, was not effective for any taxable year of X, Y, or Z, and an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for the 1968 and 1969 taxable years of X and Y. On January 1, 1968, Y's accumulated earnings and profits are, under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, maintained in separate earnings and profits accounts containing the following amounts:
Earnings and profits accumulated for
Corp
Y
Corp
Z
1964
$60,000
$40,000
1965
30,000
15,000
1966
(5,000)
2,000
1967
12,000
6,000
Corporation Y had earnings and profits of $10,000 in each of the years 1968 and 1969, and made distributions during such years in the following amounts:
1968
$29,000
1969
31,000
(i) The source of the 1968 distribution, determined in accordance with the rules of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, is as follows:
(
a
) Dividend from Y's current year's earnings and profits (1968)
$10,000
(
b
) Dividend from earnings and profits of Y accumulated for 1967
12,000
(
c
) Dividend from earnings and profits of Z accumulated for:
1967
6,000
1966
1,000
29,000
Since the 1968 dividend is considered paid out of earnings and profits of Y's 1968 and 1967 years, and Z's 1967 and 1966 years, and since each of these years satisfies each of the conditions specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, X is entitled to a 100-percent dividends received deduction with respect to the entire 1968 distribution of $29,000 from Y.
(ii) The source of the 1969 distribution of $31,000, determined in accordance with the rules of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, is as follows:
(
a
) Dividend from Y's current year's earnings and profits (1969)
$10,000
(
b
) Dividend from earnings and profits of Z accumulated for 1966 (1966 earnings and profits remaining after 1968 distribution, i.e., $2,000−$1,000
1,000
(
c
) Dividend from earnings and profits of Y and Z accumulated for 1965:
Corporation Y: $25,000 (i.e., $30,000−$5,000 deficit) divided by $40,000 (i.e., the sum of the 1965 earnings and profits of Y and Z) multiplied by $20,000 (the portion of the distribution from the 1965 earnings and profits of Y and Z)
12,500
Corporation Z: $15,000 divided by $40,000 multiplied by $20,000
7,500
31,000
The sum of the dividends from Y's 1969 year ($10,000), Z's 1966 year ($1,000), and Y's 1965 year ($12,500), or $23,500, qualifies for the 100-percent dividends received deduction. However, the dividends paid out of Z's 1965 year ($7,500) do not qualify because on each day of 1965 Z and X were not members of the affiliated group of which Y (the distributing corporation) and X (the corporation receiving the dividends) were members on the day in 1969 when the dividends were received by X.
(b)
Definition of affiliated group.
For purposes of this section and § 1.243-5, the term
affiliated group
shall have the meaning assigned to it by section 1504(a), except that insurance companies subject to taxation under section 802 or 821 shall be treated as includible corporations (notwithstanding section 1504(b)(2)), and the provisions of section 1504(c) shall not apply.
(c)
Election
—(1)
Manner and time of making election
—(i)
General.
The election provided by section 243(b)(2) shall be made for an affiliated group by the common parent corporation and shall be made for a particular taxable year of the common parent corporation. Such election may not be made for any taxable year of the common parent corporation for which a multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562 is effective. The election shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation, stating that the affiliated group elects under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year. The statement shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent. The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly-owned subsidiaries) that is a member of the
affiliated group at the time the election is filed. The statement may be filed at any time, provided that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of which for its matching taxable year of election (or for any subsequent taxable year) would be increased because of the election, at the time of filing there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against such corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.
(ii)
Information statement by common parent.
If a corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group after the date on which the election is filed and during its matching taxable year of election, then the common parent shall file, within 60 days after such corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group, an additional statement containing the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of such corporation. Such additional statement shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the election was filed.
(iii)
Definition of matching taxable year of election.
For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the term
matching taxable year of election
shall mean the taxable year of each member (including the common parent corporation) of the electing affiliated group which includes the last day of the taxable year of the common parent corporation for which an election by the affiiliated group is made under section 243(b)(2).
(2)
Consents by subsidiary corporations
—(i)
General.
Each corporation (other than the common parent corporation) which is a member of the electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in the filing of a consolidated return) at any time during its matching taxable year of election must consent to such election in the manner and time provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, whichever is applicable.
(ii)
Wholly owned subsidiary.
If all of the stock of a corporation is owned by a member or members of the affiliated group on each day of such corporation's matching taxable year of election, then such corporation (referred to in this paragraph as a “wholly owned subsidiary”) shall be deemed to consent to such election.
(iii)
Other members.
The consent of each member of the affiliated group (other than a wholly owned subsidiary) shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the consenting member, stating that such member consents to the election under section 243(b)(2). The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the consenting member and of the common parent corporation, and in the case of a statement filed after December 31, 1968, the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. The consent of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single statement. The statement (or statements) shall be attached to the election filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of a corporation that, after the date the election was filed and during its matching taxable year of election, either (
a
) becomes a member, or (
b
) ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a member, shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the election was filed and shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for the filing of the consenting member's income tax return for such taxable year, or on or before June 10, 1964, whichever is later.
(iv)
Statement attached to return.
Each corporation that consents to an election by means of a statement described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph should attach a copy of the statement to its income tax return for its matching taxable year of election, or, if such return has already been filed, to its first income tax return filed on or after the date on which the statement is
filed. However, if such return is filed on or before June 10, 1964, a copy of such statement should be filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director with whom such return is filed. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a statement to its income tax return for its matching taxable year of election, or, if such return has already been filed, to its first income tax return filed on or after the date on which the statement is filed stating that it is subject to an election under section 243(b)(2) and the taxable year to which the election applies, and setting forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common parent corporation, and in the case of a statement filed after December 31, 1968, the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. However, if the due date for such return (including extensions of time) is before June 10, 1964, such statement should be filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director with whom such return is filed.
(3)
Information statement by member.
If a corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group during a taxable year that begins after the last day of the common parent corporation's matching taxable year of election, then (unless such election has been terminated) such corporation should attach a statement to its income tax return for such taxable year stating that it is subject to an election under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year and setting forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common parent corporation, and the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. In the case of an affiliated group that made an election under the rules provided in Treasury Decision 6721, approved April 8, 1964 (29 FR 4997, C.B. 1964-1 (Part 1), 625), such statement shall be filed, on or before March 15, 1969, with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located such member's principal place of business or principal office or agency.
(4)
Years for which election effective
—(i)
General rule.
An election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group shall be effective:
(
a
) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group at any time during its matching taxable year of election, for such taxable year, and
(
b
) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group at any time during a taxable year ending after the last day of the common parent's taxable year of election but which does not include such last day, for such taxable year, unless the election is terminated under section 243(b)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, the election has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually.
(ii)
Special rule for certain taxable years ending in 1964.
In the case of a taxable year of a member (other than the common parent corporation) of the affiliated group (
a
) which begins in 1963 and ends in 1964, and (
b
) for which an election is not effective under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph, if an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for the taxable year of the common parent corporation which includes the last day of such taxable year of such member, then such election shall be effective for such taxable year of such member if such member files a separate consent with respect to such taxable year. However, in order for a dividend distributed by such member during such taxable year to meet the requirements of section 243(b)(1), an election under section 243(b)(2) must be effective for the taxable year of each member of the affiliated group which includes the date such dividend is received. See section 243(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, if the dividend is to qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction under section 243(a)(3), a consent must be filed under this subdivision by each member of the affiliated group with respect to its taxable year which includes the day the dividend is received (unless an election is effective for such taxable year under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph). For purposes of this subdivision, a consent shall be made by means of a statement
meeting the requirements of subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, and shall be attached to the election made by the common parent corporation for its taxable year which includes the last day of the taxable year of the member with respect to which the consent is made. A copy of the statement should be filed, within 60 days after such election is filed by the common parent corporation, with the district director with whom the consenting member filed its income tax return for such taxable year.
(iii)
Examples.
The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, relating to the special rule for certain taxable years ending in 1964, may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P Corporation owns all the stock of S-1 Corporation on each day of 1963, 1964, and 1965. P uses the calendar year as its taxable year and S-1 uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as its taxable year. P makes an election under section 243(b)(2) for 1964. Since S-1 is a wholly owned subsidiary for its taxable year ending June 30, 1965, it is deemed to consent to the election. However, in order for the election to be effective with respect to S-1's taxable year ending June 30, 1964, a statement specifying that S-1 consents to the election with respect to such taxable year and containing the information required in a statement of consent under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph must be attached to the election.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that P also owns all the stock of S-2 Corporation on each day of 1963, 1964, and 1965. S-2 uses a fiscal year ending May 31 as its taxable year. If S-1 distributes a dividend to P on January 15, 1964, the dividend may qualify under section 243(a)(3) only if S-1 and S-2 both consent to the election made by P for 1964 with respect to their taxable years ending in 1964.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that P uses a fiscal year ending on January 31 as its taxable year and makes an election under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for its taxable year ending January 31, 1964. Since S-1's taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 includes January 31, 1964, the last day of P's taxable year for which the election was made, the election is effective under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph, for S-1's taxable year ending June 30, 1964. Accordingly, the special rule of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph has no application.
(d)
Effect of election.
For restrictions and limitations applicable to corporations which are members of an electing affiliated group on each day of their taxable years, see § 1.243-5.
(e)
Termination of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group may be terminated with respect to any taxable year of the common parent corporation after the matching taxable year of election of the common parent corporation. The election is terminated as a result of one of the occurrences described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. For years affected by termination, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Consent of members
—(i)
General.
An election may be terminated for an affiliated group by its common parent corporation with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation provided each corporation (other than the common parent) that was a member of the affiliated group at any time during its taxable year that includes the last day of such year of the common parent (the “matching taxable year of termination”) consents to such termination. The statement of termination may be filed by the common parent corporation at any time, provided that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of which for its matching taxable year of termination (or for any subsequent taxable year) would be increased because of the termination, at the time of filing there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against such corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)
(ii)
Statements filed after December 31, 1968.
With respect to statements of termination filed after December 31, 1968:
(
a
) The statement shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation;
(
b
) The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall state that the affiliated group terminates the election under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year;
(
c
) The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly owned subsidiaries) which is a member of the affiliated group at the time the termination is filed; and
(
d
) The consents to the termination shall be given in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, relating to manner and time for giving consents to an election under section 243(b)(2).
(3)
Refusal by new member to consent
—(i)
Manner of giving refusal.
If any corporation which is a new member of an affiliated group with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation (other than the matching taxable year of election of the common parent corporation) files a statement that it does not consent to an election under section 243(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year, then such election shall terminate with respect to such taxable year. Such statement shall be signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the new member, and shall be filed with the timely filed income tax return of such new member for its taxable year within which falls the last day of such taxable year of the common parent corporation. In the event of a termination under this subparagraph, each corporation (other than such new member) that is a member of the affiliated group at any time during its taxable year which includes such last day should, within 30 days after such new member files the statement of refusal to consent, notify the district director of such termination. Such notification should be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation.
(ii)
Corporation considered as new member.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a corporation shall be considered to be a new member of an affiliated group of corporations with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation if such corporation:
(
a
) Is a member of the affiliated group at any time during such taxable year of the common parent corporation, and
(
b
) Was not a member of the affiliated group at any time during the common parent corporation's immediately preceding taxable year.
(4)
Effect of termination.
A termination under subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph is effective with respect to (i) the common parent corporation's taxable year referred to in the particular subparagraph under which the termination occurs, and (ii) the taxable years of the other members of the affiliated group which include the last day of such taxable year of the common parent. An election, once terminated, is no longer effective. Accordingly, the termination is also effective with respect to the succeeding taxable years of the members of the group. However, the affiliated group may make a new election in accordance with the provisions of section 243(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section.
[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 817, Jan. 18, 1969]
§ 1.243-5
Effect of election.
(a)
General
—(1)
Corporations subject to restrictions and limitations.
If an election by an affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then each corporation (including the common parent corporation) which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable year shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section for such taxable year. For purposes of this section, the term
matching taxable year
shall mean the taxable year of each member (including the common parent corporation) of an affiliated group which includes the last day of a particular taxable year of the common parent corporation for which an election by the affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective. If a corporation is a member of an affiliated group on each day of a short taxable year which does not include the last day of
a taxable year of the common parent corporation, and if an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for such short year, see paragraph (g) of this section. In the case of taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 for which an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of § 1.243-4, see paragraph (f)(9) of this section.
(2)
Members filing consolidated returns.
The restrictions and limitations prescribed by this section shall apply notwithstanding the fact that some of the corporations which are members of the electing affiliated group (within the meaning of section 243(b)(5)) join in the filing of a consolidated return. Thus, for example, if an electing affiliated group includes one or more corporations taxable under section 11 of the Code and two or more insurance companies taxable under section 802 of the Code, and if the insurance companies join in the filing of a consolidated return, the amount of such companies' exemptions from estimated tax (for purposes of sections 6016 and 6655) shall be the amounts determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section and not the amounts determined pursuant to the regulations under section 1502.
(b)
Multiple surtax exemption election
—(1)
General rule.
If an election by an affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then no corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year may consent (or shall be deemed to consent) to an election under section 1562(a)(1), relating to election of multiple surtax exemptions, which would be effective for such matching taxable year. Thus, each corporation which is a component member of the controlled group of corporations with respect to its matching taxable year (determined by applying section 1563(b) without regard to paragraph (2)(D) thereof) shall determine its surtax exemption for such taxable year in accordance with section 1561 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Special rule for certain insurance companies.
Under section 243(b)(6)(A), if the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph apply with respect to the taxable year of an insurance company subject to taxation under section 802 or 821, then the surtax exemption of such insurance company for such taxable year shall be determined by applying part II (section 1561 and following), subchapter B, chapter 6 of the Code, with respect to such insurance company and the other corporations which are component members of the controlled group of corporations (as determined under section 1563 without regard to subsections (a)(4) and (b)(2)(D) thereof) of which such insurance company is a member, without regard to section 1563(a)(4) (relating to certain insurance companies treated as a separate controlled group) and section 1563(b)(2)(D) (relating to certain insurance companies treated as excluded members).
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Throughout 1965 corporation M owns all the stock of corporations L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. M is a domestic mutual insurance company subject to tax under section 821 of the Code, L-1 and L-2 are domestic life insurance companies subject to tax under section 802 of the Code, and S-1 and S-2 are domestic corporations subject to tax under section 11 of the Code. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year. M makes a valid election under section 243(b)(2) for the affiliated group consisting of M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. If part II, subchapter B, chapter 6 of the Code were applied with respect to the 1965 taxable years of the corporations without regard to section 243(b)(6)(A), the following would result: S-1 and S-2 would be treated as component members of a controlled group of corporations on such date; L-1 and L-2 would be treated as component members of a separate controlled group on such date; and M would be treated as an excluded member. However, since section 243(b)(6)(A) requires that part II of subchapter B be applied without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (b)(2)(D), for purposes of determining the surtax exemptions of M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2 for their 1965 taxable years, such corporations are treated for purposes of such part II as component members of a single controlled group of corporations on December 31, 1965. Moreover, by reason of having made the election under section 243(b)(2), M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2 cannot consent to multiple surtax exemption elections under section 1562 which would be effective for their 1965 taxable years. Thus, such corporations are limited to a single $25,000 surtax exemption for such taxable
years (to be apportioned among such corporations in accordance with section 1561 and the regulations thereunder).
(c)
Foreign tax credit
—(1)
General.
If an election by an affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then:
(i) The credit under section 901 for taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country or possession of the United States shall be allowed to a corporation which is a member of such affiliated group for each day of its matching taxable year only if each other corporation which pays or accrues such foreign taxes to any foreign country or possession, and which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable year, does not deduct such taxes in computing its tax liability for its matching taxable year, and
(ii) A corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year may use the overall limitation provided in section 904(a)(2) for such matching taxable year only if each other corporation which pays or accrues foreign taxes to any foreign country or possession, and which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable year, uses such limitation for its matching taxable year.
(2)
Consent of the Commissioner.
In the absence of unusual circumstances, a request by a corporation for the consent of the Commissioner to the revocation of an election of the overall limitation, or to a new election of the overall limitation, for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph will be given favorable consideration, notwithstanding the fact that there has been no change in the basic nature of the corporation's business or changes in conditions in a foreign country which substantially affect the corporation's business. See paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.904-1.
(d)
Other restrictions and limitations
—(1)
General rule.
If an election by an affilated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then, except to the extent that an apportionment plan adopted under paragraph (f) of this section for such taxable year provides otherwise with respect to a restriction or limitation described in this paragraph, the rules provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph shall apply to each corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year for the purpose of computing the amount of such restriction or limitation for its matching taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph, each corporation which is a member of an electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in filing a consolidated return) shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of determining the amount of such restrictions and limitations.
(2)
Accumulated earnings credit
—(i)
General.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, in determining the minimum accumulated earnings credit under section 535(c)(2) (or the accumulated earnings credit of a mere holding or investment company under section 535(c)(3) for each corporation which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year, in lieu of the $150,000 amount ($100,000 amount in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975) mentioned in such sections there shall be substituted an amount equal to (
a
) $150,000 ($100,000 in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975), divided by (
b
) the number of such members.
(ii)
Allocation of excess.
If, with respect to one or more members, the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph exceeds the sum of (
a
) such member's accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the preceding taxable year, plus (
b
) such member's earnings and profits for the taxable year which are retained (within the meaning of section 535(c)(1), then any such excess shall be subtracted from the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and shall be divided equally among those remaining members of the affiliated group that do not have such an excess (until no such excess remains to be divided among those remaining members that have not had such an excess). The excess so divided among such remaining members shall be added to the amount determined under subdivision (i) with respect to such members.
(iii)
Apportionment plan not allowed.
An affiliated group may not adopt an apportionment plan, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, with respect to the amounts computed under the provisions of this subparagraph.
(iv)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example;

# Example.
An affiliated group is composed of four member corporations, W, X, Y, and Z. The sum of the accumulated earnings and profits (as of the close of the preceding taxable year ending December 31, 1975) plus the earnings and profits for the taxable year ending December 31, 1976 which are retained is $15,000, $75,000, $37,500, and $300,000 in the case of W, X, Y, and Z, respectively. The amounts determined under this subparagraph for W, X, Y, and Z are $15,000, $48,750, $37,500 and $48,750, respectively, computed as follows:

Mine exploration expenditures
—(i)
Limitation under section 615(a).
If the aggregate of the expenditures to which section 615(a) applies, which are paid or incurred by corporations which are members of the affiliated group on each day of their matching taxable years (during such taxable years) exceeds $100,000, then the deduction (or amount deferrable) under section 615 for any such member for its matching taxable year shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount which bears the same ratio to $100,000 as the amount deductible or deferrable by such member under section 615 (computed without regard to this subdivision) bears to the aggregate of the amounts deductible or deferrable under section 615 (as so computed) by all such members.
(ii)
Limitation under section 615(c).
If the aggregate of the expenditures to which section 615(a) applies which are paid or incurred by the corporations which are members of such affiliated group on each day of their matching taxable years (during such taxable years) would, when added to the aggregate of the amounts deducted or deferred in prior taxable years which are taken into account by such corporations in applying the limitation of section 615(c), exceed $400,000, then section 615 shall not apply to any such expenditure so paid or incurred by any such member to the extent such expenditure would exceed the amount which bears the same ratio to (
a
) the amount, if any, by which $400,000 exceeds the amounts so deducted or deferred in prior years, as (
b
) such member's deduction (or amount deferrable) under section 615 (computed without regard to this subdivision) for such expenditures paid or incurred by such member during its matching taxable year, bears to (
c
) the aggregate of the amounts deductible or deferrable under section 615 (as so computed) by all such members during their matching taxable years.
(iii)
Treatment of corporations filing consolidated returns.
For purposes of making the computations under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, a corporation which joins in the filing of a consolidated return shall be treated as if it filed a separate return.
(iv)
Estimate of exploration expenditures.
If, on the date a corporation (which is a member of an affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year) files its income tax return for such taxable year, it cannot be determined whether or not the $100,000 limitation prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or the $400,000 limitation prescribed by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, will apply with respect to such taxable year, then
such member shall, for purposes of such return, apply the provisions of such subdivisions (i) and (ii) with respect to such taxable year on the basis of an estimate of the aggregate of the exploration expenditures by all such members of the affiliated group for their matching taxable years. Such estimate shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances known at the time of such estimate. If an estimate is used by any such member of the affiliated group pursuant to this subdivision, and if the actual expenditures by all such members differ from the estimate, then each such member shall file as soon as possible an original or amended return reflecting an amended apportionment (either pursuant to an apportionment plan adopted under paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to the application of the rule provided by subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph) based upon such actual expenditures.
(v)
Amount apportioned under apportionment plan.
If an electing affiliated group adopts an apportionment plan as provided in paragraph (f) of this section with respect to the limitation under section 615(a) or 615(c), then the amount apportioned under such plan to any corporation which is a member of such group may not exceed the amount which such member could have deducted (or deferred) under section 615 had such affiliated group not filed an election under section 243(b)(2).
(4)
Small business deductions of life insurance companies.
In the case of a life insurance company taxable under section 802 which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year, the small business deduction under sections 804(a)(4) and 809(d)(10) shall not exceed an amount equal to $25,000 divided by the number of life insurance companies taxable under section 802 which are members of such group on each day of their matching taxable years.
(5)
Estimated tax
—(i)
Exemption from estimated tax.
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the exemption from estimated tax (for purposes of estimated tax filing requirements under section 6016 and the addition to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax) of each corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year shall be (in lieu of the $100,000 amount specified in section 6016(a) and (b)(2)(A) and in section 6655(d)(1) and (e)(2)(A) an amount equal to $100,000 divided by the number of such members.
(ii)
Nonapplication to certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964.
For purposes of this section, if a corporation has a taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 the last day of the eighth month of which falls on or before April 10, 1964, then (notwithstanding the fact that an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for such taxable year) subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply to such corporation for such taxable year. Thus, such corporation shall be entitled to a $100,000 exemption from estimated tax for such taxable year. Also, with respect to a taxable year described in the first sentence of this subdivision, any such corporation shall not be considered to be a member of the affiliated group for purposes of determining the number of members referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iii)
Examples.
The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation P owns all the stock of corporation S-1 on each day of 1965. On March 1, 1965, P acquires all the stock of corporation S-2. Corporations P, S-1, and S-2 file separate returns on a calendar year basis. On March 31, 1965, the affiliated group consisting of P, S-1, and S-2 anticipates making an election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 taxable year. If the affiliated group does make a valid election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph the exemption from estimated tax of P for 1965, and the exemption from estimated tax of S-1 for 1965, will be (assuming an apportionment plan is not filed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section) an amount equal to $50,000 ($100,000 ÷ 2). (Since S-2 is not a member of the affiliated group on each day of 1965, S-2's exemption from estimated tax will be determined for the year 1965 without regard to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, whether or not the affiliated group makes the election under section 243(b)(2).) P and S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on such basis and make payments with respect to such declarations on such basis.
Thus, if the affiliated group does make a valid election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, P and S-1 will not incur (as a result of the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to their 1965 years) additions to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that, on March 31, 1965, S-1 anticipates that it will incur a loss for its 1965 year. Accordingly, in anticipation of making an election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year and adopting an apportionment plan under paragraph (f) of this section, P computes its estimated tax liability for 1965 on the basis of a $100,000 exemption, and S-1 computes its estimated tax liability for 1965 on the basis of a zero exemption. Assume S-1 incurs a loss for 1965 as anticipated. Thus, if P does make the election for 1965, and an apportionment plan is adopted apportioning $100,000 to P and zero to S-1 (for their 1965 years), P and S-1 will not incur (as a result of the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to their 1965 years) additions to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that P and S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on the basis of separate $100,000 exemptions from estimated tax for their 1965 years, and make payments with respect to such declarations on such basis. Assume that the affiliated group makes an election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year. Under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, P and S-1 are limited in the aggregate to a single $100,000 exemption from estimated tax for their 1965 years. The provisions of section 6655 will be applied to the 1965 year of P and the 1965 year of S-1 on the basis of a $50,000 exemption from estimated tax for each corporation, unless a different apportionment of the $100,000 amount is adopted under paragraph (f) of this section. Since the election was made under section 243(b)(2), regardless of whether or not the affiliated group anticipated making the election, P or S-1 (or both) may incur additions to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax.
(e)
Effect of election for certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964.
If an election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group is effective for a taxable year of a corporation under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of § 1.243-4 (relating to election for certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964), and if such corporation is a member of such group on each day of such taxable year, then the restrictions and limitations prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall apply to all such members having such taxable years (for such taxable years). For purposes of this paragraph, such paragraphs shall be applied with respect to such taxable years as if such taxable years included the last day of a taxable year of the common parent corporation for which an election was effective under section 243(b)(2),
i.e.,
as if such taxable years were matching taxable years. For apportionment plans with respect to such taxable years, see paragraph (f) (9) of this section.
(f)
Apportionment plans
—(1)
In general.
In the case of corporations which are members of an affiliated group of corporations on each day of their matching taxable years:
(i) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section (relating to limitation under section 615(a)),
(ii) The amount determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(
a
) of this section (relating to limitation under section 615(c)),
(iii) The $25,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(4) of this section (relating to small business deduction of life insurance companies), and
(iv) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section (relating to exemption from estimated tax), may be apportioned among such members (for such taxable years) if the common parent corporation files an apportionment plan with respect to such taxable years in the manner provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, and if all other members consent to the plan, in the manner provided in subparagraph (5) or (6) of this paragraph (whichever is applicable). The plan may provide for the apportionment to one or more of such members, in fixed dollar amounts, of one or more of the amounts referred to in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, but in no event shall the sum of the amounts so apportioned in respect to any such subdivision exceed the amount referred to in such subdivision. See also paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section, relating to the maximum amount that may be apportioned to a corporation under this subparagraph with respect to exploration expenditures to which section 615 applies.
(2)
Time for adopting plan.
An affiliated group may adopt an apportionment plan with respect to the matching taxable years of its members only if, at the time such plan is sought to be adopted, there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against any corporation the tax liability of which for any taxable year would be increased by the adoption of such plan. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)
(3)
Years for which effective.
A valid apportionment plan with respect to matching taxable years of members of an affiliated group shall be effective for such matching taxable years, and for all succeeding matching taxable years of such members, unless the plan is amended in accordance with subparagraph (8) of this paragraph or is terminated. Thus, the apportionment plan (including any amendments thereof) has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually. An apportionment plan with respect to a particular taxable year of the common parent shall terminate with respect to the taxable years of the members of the affiliated group which include the last day of a succeeding taxable year of the common parent if:
(i) Any corporation which was a member of the affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year which included the last day of the particular taxable year of the common parent is not a member of such group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of such succeeding taxable year of the common parent, or
(ii) Any corporation which was not a member of such group on each day of its taxable year which included the last day of the particular taxable year of the common parent is a member of such group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of such succeeding taxable year of the common parent.
An apportionment plan, once terminated, is no longer effective. Accordingly, unless a new apportionment plan is filed and consented to (or the section 243(b)(2) election is terminated) the amounts referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph will be apportioned among the corporations which are members of the affiliated group on each day of their matching taxable years in accordance with the rules provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(4), and (d)(5)(i) of this section.
(4)
Filing of plan.
The apportionment plan shall be in the form of a statement filed by the common parent corporation with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of such common parent. The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall set forth the name, address, internal revenue district, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of each member to whom the common parent could apportion an amount under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (or, in the case of an apportionment plan referred to in subparagraph (9) of this paragraph, each member to whom the common parent could apportion an amount under such subparagraph) and the amount (or amounts) apportioned to each such member under the plan.
(5)
Consent of wholly owned subsidiaries.
If all the stock of a corporation which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year is owned on each such day by another corporation (or corporations) which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable year, such corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as a “wholly owned subsidiary”) shall be deemed to consent to the apportionment plan. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a copy of the plan filed by the common parent corporation to an income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable year.
(6)
Consent of other members.
The consent of each member (other than the
common parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries) to an apportionment plan shall be in the form of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the member consenting to the plan, stating that such member consents to the plan. The consent of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single statement. The statement (or statements) shall be attached to the apportionment plan filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of any such member which, after the date the apportionment plan was filed and during its matching taxable year referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a member, shall be filled with the district director with whom the apportionment plan is filed (as soon as possible after it ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary). Each consenting member should attach a copy of the apportionment plan filed by the common parent to an income tax return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable year which includes the last day of the taxable year of the common parent corporation for which the apportionment plan was filed.

Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, if the members of an affiliated group of corporations include one or more corporations taxable under section 11 of the Code and one or more insurance companies taxable under section 802 or 821 of the Code and if the affiliated group includes corporations which join in the filing of a consolidated return, then, for purposes of determining the amount to be apportioned to a corporation under an apportionment plan adopted under this paragraph, the corporations filing the consolidated return shall be treated as a single member.
(ii)
Consenting to an apportionment plan.
For purposes of consenting to an apportionment plan under subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this paragraph, if the members of an affiliated group of corporations include corporations which join in the filing of a consolidated return, each corporation which joins in filing the consolidated return shall be treated as a separate member.
(8)
Amendment of plan.
An apportionment plan, which is effective for the matching taxable years of members of an affiliated group, may be amended if an amended plan is filed (and consented to) within the time and in accordance with the rules prescribed in this paragraph for the adoption of an original plan with respect to such taxable years.

(iii) An election under section 243(b)(2) by such group is effective under paragraph (c) (4) (i) of § 1.243-4 for the taxable year of the common parent within which falls such short period, then the restrictions and limitations prescribed by section 243(b)(3) shall be applied in the manner provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Manner of applying restrictions.
In the case of a corporation described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph having a short period described in such subparagraph:
(i) Such corporation may not consent to an election under section 1562, relating to election of multiple surtax exemptions, which would be effective for such short period;
(ii) The credit under section 901 shall be allowed to such corporation for such short period if, and only if, each corporation, which pays or accrues foreign taxes and which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of the common parent's taxable year within which falls such short period, does not deduct such taxes in computing its tax liability for its taxable year which includes such last day;
(iii) The overall limitation provided in section 904(a)(2) shall be allowed to such corporation for such short period if, and only if, each corporation, which pays or accrues foreign taxes and which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of the common parent's taxable year within which falls such short period, uses such limitation for its taxable year which includes such last day;
(iv) The minimum accumulated earnings credit provided by section 535(c)(2) (or in the case of a mere holding or investment company, the accumulated earnings credit provided by section 535(c)(3)) allowable for such short period shall be the amount computed by dividing (a) the amount (if any) by which $100,000 exceeds the aggregate of the accumulated earnings and profits of the corporations, which are members of the affiliated group on the last day of such short period, as of the close of their taxable years preceding the taxable year which includes the last day of such short period, by (b) the number of such members on the last day of such short period;
(v) The deduction allowable under section 615(a) for such short period shall be limited to an amount equal to $100,000 divided by the number of corporations which are members of the affiliated group on the last day of such short period;
(vi) If the expenditures to which section 615(a) applies which are paid or incurred by such corporation during such short period would, when added to the aggregate of the amounts deducted or deferred (in taxable years ending before the last day of such short period) which are taken into account in applying the limitation of section 615(c) by corporations which are members of the affiliated group on the last day of such short period exceed $400,000, then section 615 shall not apply to any such expenditure so paid or incurred by such corporation to the extent such expenditure would exceed an amount equal to (
a
) the amount (if any) by which $400,000 exceeds the aggregate of the amounts so deducted or deferred in such taxable years (computed as if each member filed a separate return), divided by (
b
) the number of corporations in the group which have taxable years ending on such last day;
(vii) If such corporation is a life insurance company taxable under section 802, the small business deduction under sections 804(a)(4) and 809(d)(10) shall not exceed an amount equal to (
a
) $25,000, divided by (

[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 821, Jan. 18, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7376, 40 FR 42745, Sept. 16, 1975]
§ 1.245-1
Dividends received from certain foreign corporations.
(a)
General rule.
(1) A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 245(a) for dividends received from a foreign corporation (other than a foreign personal holding company as defined in section 552) which is subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code if, for an uninterrupted period of not less than 36 months ending with the close of the foreign corporation's taxable year in which the dividends are paid, (i) the foreign corporation is engaged in trade or business in the United States, and (ii) 50 percent or more of the foreign corporation's entire gross income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation. If the foreign corporation has been in existence less than 36 months as of the close of the taxable year in which the dividends are paid, then the applicable uninterrupted period to be taken into consideration in lieu of the uninterrupted period of 36 or more months is the entire period such corporation has been in existence as of the close of such taxable year. An uninterrupted period which satisfied the twofold requirement with respect to business activity and gross income may start at a date later than the date on which the foreign corporation first commenced an uninterrupted period of engaging in trade or business within the United States, but the applicable uninterrupted period is in any event the longest uninterrupted period which satisfies such twofold requirement. The deduction under section 245(a) is allowable to any corporation, whether foreign or domestic, receiving dividends from a distributing corporation which meets the requirements of that section.
(2) Any taxable year of a foreign corporation which falls within the uninterrupted period described in section 245(a)(2) shall not be taken into account in applying section 245(a)(2) and this paragraph if the 100 percent dividends received deduction would be allowable under paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not in fact allowed, with respect to any dividends payable, whether or not in fact paid, out of the earnings and profits of such foreign corporation for that taxable year. Thus, in such case the foreign corporation shall be treated as having no earnings and profits for that taxable year for purposes of determining the dividends received deduction allowable under section 245(a) and this paragraph. However, that taxable year may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the foreign corporation meets the requirements of section 245(a) that, for the uninterrupted period specified therein, the foreign corporation is engaged in trade or business in the United States and meets the 50 percent gross income requirement.
(b)
Dividends from wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
(1) A domestic corporation is allowed a deduction under section 245(b) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, for dividends received from a foreign corporation (other than a foreign personal holding company as defined in section 552) which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code if:
(i) The domestic corporation owns either directly or indirectly all of the outstanding stock of the foreign corporation during the entire taxable year of the domestic corporation in which the dividends are received, and
(ii) The dividends are paid out of earnings and profits of a taxable year of the foreign corporation during which (
a
) the domestic corporation receiving the dividends owns directly or indirectly throughout such year all of the outstanding stock of the foreign corporation, and (
b
) all of the gross income of the foreign corporation from all sources is effectively connected for
that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation.
(2) The deduction allowed by section 245(b) does not apply if an election under section 1562, relating to the privilege of a controlled group of corporations to elect multiple surtax exemptions, is effective for either the taxable year of the domestic corporation in which the dividends are received or the taxable year of the foreign corporation out of the earnings and profits of which the dividends are paid.
(c)
Rules of application.
(1) Except as provided in section 246, the deduction provided by section 245 for any taxable year is the sum of the amounts computed under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 245(a) plus, in the case of a domestic corporation for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, the sum of the amounts computed under section 245(b)(2).
(2) To the extent that a dividend received from a foreign corporation is treated as a dividend from a domestic corporation in accordance with section 243(d) and § 1.243-3, it shall not be treated as a dividend received from a foreign corporation for purposes of this section.
(3) For purposes of section 245 (a) and (b), the amount of a distribution shall be determined under subparagraph (B) (without reference to subparagraph (C)) of section 301(b)(1).
(4) In determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend is treated as having been distributed for purposes of this section, the principles of paragraph (a) of § 1.316-2 shall apply. A dividend shall be considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which includes the date the dividend is distributed, second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable year, third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year, etc. A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any taxable year shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a prior year in such account. If there are no accumulated earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a deficit incurred in a prior year, such deficit must be restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent accounting year. See also paragraph (c) of § 1.243-3 and paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.243-4.
(5) For purposes of this section the gross income of a foreign corporation for any period before its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, which is from sources within the United States shall be treated as gross income which is effectively connected for that period with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation.
(6) For the determination of the source of income and the income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, see sections 861 through 864, and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation A (a foreign corporation filing its income tax returns on a calendar year basis) whose stock is 100 percent owned by Corporation B (a domestic corporation filing its income tax returns on a calendar year basis) for the first time engaged in trade or business within the United States on January 1, 1943, and qualifies under section 245 for the entire period beginning on that date and ending on December 31, 1954. Corporation A had accumulated earnings and profits of $50,000 immediately prior to January 1, 1943, and had earnings and profits of $10,000 for each taxable year during the uninterrupted period from January 1, 1943, through December 31, 1954. It derived for the period from January 1, 1943, through December 31, 1953, 90 percent of its gross income from sources within the United States and in 1954 derived 95 percent of its gross income from sources within the United States. During the calendar years 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947 Corporation A distributed in each year $15,000; during the calendar years 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 it distributed in each year $5,000; and during the year 1954, $50,000. An analysis of the accumulated earnings and profits under the above statement of facts discloses that at December 31, 1953, the accumulation amounted to $55,000, of which $25,000 was accumulated prior to the “uninterrupted period” and $30,000 was accumulated during the uninterrupted period. (See section 316(a) and paragraph (c) of this section.) For 1954 a deduction under section 245 of $31,025 ($8,075 on 1954 earnings of the foreign corporation, plus $22,950 from the $30,000 accumulation at December 31, 1953)
for dividends received from a foreign corporation is allowable to Corporation B with respect to the $50,000 received from Corporation A, computed as follows:
(i) $8,075, which is $8,500 (85 percent—the percent specified in section 243 for the calendar year 1954—of the $10,000 of earnings and profits of the taxable year) multiplied by 95 percent (the portion of the gross income of Corporation A derived during the taxable year 1954 from sources within the United States), plus
(ii) $22,950, which is $25,500 (85 percent—the percent specified in section 243 for the calendar year 1954—of $30,000, the part of the earnings and profits accumulated after the beginning of the uninterrupted period) multiplied by 90 percent (the portion of the gross income of Corporation A derived from sources within the United States during that portion of the uninterrupted period ending at the beginning of the taxable year 1954).

# Example 2.
If in
Example 1,
Corporation A for the taxable year 1954 had incurred a deficit of $10,000 (shown to have been incurred before December 31) the amount of the earnings and profits accumulated after the beginning of the uninterrupted period would be $20,000. If Corporation A had distributed $50,000 on December 31, 1954, the deduction under section 245 for dividends received from a foreign corporation allowable to Corporation B for 1954 would be $15,300, computed by multiplying $17,000 (85 percent—the percent specified in section 243 for the calendar year 1954—of $20,000 earnings and profits accumulated after the beginning of the uninterrupted period) by 90 percent (the portion of the gross income of Corporation A derived from United States sources during that portion of the uninterrupted period ending at the beginning of the taxable year 1954).

# Example 3.
Corporation A (a foreign corporation filing its income tax returns on a calendar year basis) whose stock is 100 percent owned by corporation B (a domestic corporation filing its income tax returns on a calendar year basis) for the first time engaged in trade or business within the United States on January 1, 1960, and qualifies under section 245 for the entire period beginning on that date and ending on December 31, 1963. In 1963, A derived 75 percent of its gross income from sources within the United States. A's earnings and profits for 1963 (computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year) are $200,000. On December 31, 1963, corporation A distributes to corporation B 100 shares of corporation C stock which have an adjusted basis in A's hands of $40,000 and a fair market value of $100,000. For purposes of computing the deduction under section 245 for dividends received from a foreign corporation, the amount of the distribution is $40,000. B is allowed a deduction under section 245 of $25,500, i.e., $34,000 ($40,000 multiplied by 85 percent, the percent specified in section 243 for 1963), multiplied by 75 percent (the portion of the gross income of corporation A derived during 1963 from sources within the United States).

Facts and circumstances.
A determination as to whether a disposition is undertaken outside of the ordinary course of an SFC's activities is made on the basis of facts and circumstances, taking into account whether the transaction is consistent with the SFC's past activities, including with respect to quantity and frequency. In addition, a disposition of specified property by an SFC to a related party may be considered outside of the ordinary course of the SFC's activities notwithstanding that the SFC regularly disposes of property of the same type of, or similar to, the specified property to persons that are not related parties.
(C)
Per se rules
—(
1
)
In general.
Even if a disposition would otherwise be considered to be undertaken in the ordinary course of an SFC's activities under the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, that disposition is treated as occurring outside of the ordinary course of an SFC's activities if the disposition is undertaken with a principal purpose of generating earnings and profits during the disqualified period or, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(

) of this section, a disposition of intangible property that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(

)(
i
) is determined to be within or without the ordinary course of an SFC's activities based on the test described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(

Facts and circumstances presumption for property described in section 367(d)(4)(A).
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, any disposition described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
i
) of this section of a copyright right within the meaning of § 1.861-18 or of intangible property described in section 367(d)(4)(A) is presumed to take place outside of the ordinary course of an SFC's activities for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. The presumption in the preceding sentence may be rebutted only if the taxpayer can show that the facts and circumstances clearly establish that the disposition took place in the ordinary course of the SFC's activities.
(D)
Treatment of dispositions by certain specified entities.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, an extraordinary disposition with respect to an SFC includes a disposition by a specified entity other than a foreign corporation, provided that immediately before or immediately after the
disposition the specified entity is a related party with respect to the SFC, the SFC directly or indirectly (through one or more other specified entities other than foreign corporations) owns an interest in the specified entity, and the disposition would have otherwise qualified as an extraordinary disposition had the specified entity been a foreign corporation.
(E)
De minimis exception to extraordinary disposition.
If the sum of the net gain recognized by an SFC with respect to specified property in all dispositions otherwise described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not exceed the lesser of $50 million or 5 percent of the gross value of all of the SFC's property held immediately before the beginning of its disqualified period, then no disposition of specified property by the SFC is an extraordinary disposition.
(iii)
Disqualified period.
The term
disqualified period
means, with respect to an SFC that is a CFC on any day during the taxable year that includes January 1, 2018, the period beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending as of the close of the taxable year of the SFC, if any, that begins before January 1, 2018, and ends after December 31, 2017.
(iv)
Specified property.
The term
specified property
means any property if gain recognized with respect to such property during the disqualified period is not described in section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(I) through (V). If only a portion of the gain recognized with respect to property during the disqualified period is gain that is not described in section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(I) through (V), then a portion of the property is treated as specified property in an amount that bears the same ratio to the value of the property as the amount of gain not described in section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(I) through (V) bears to the total amount of gain recognized with respect to such property during the disqualified period. Specified property is also property with respect to which a loss was recognized during the disqualified period if the loss is properly allocable to income not described in section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(I) through (V) under the principles of section 954(b)(5) (specified loss). If only a portion of the loss recognized with respect to property during the disqualified period is specified loss, then a portion of the property is treated as specified property in an amount that bears the same ratio to the value of the property as the amount of specified loss bears to the total amount of loss recognized with respect to such property during the disqualified period.
(4)
Successor rules for extraordinary disposition accounts.
This paragraph (c)(4) applies with respect to an extraordinary disposition account upon certain direct or indirect transfers of stock of an SFC by a section 245A shareholder.
(i)
Another section 245A shareholder succeeds to all or portion of account.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section, paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section apply when a section 245A shareholder of an SFC (the
transferor
) transfers directly or indirectly a share of stock (or a portion of a share of stock) of the SFC that it owns directly or indirectly (the share or portion thereof, a
transferred share
).
(A) If immediately after the transfer (taking into account all transactions related to the transfer) another person is a section 245A shareholder of the SFC, then such other person's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC is increased by the person's proportionate share of the amount allocated to the transferred share.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the amount allocated to a transferred share is equal to the product of—
(
1
) The balance of the transferor's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends and before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B); and
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the transferred share and the denominator of which is the value of all of the stock of the SFC that the transferor owns directly or indirectly immediately before the transfer.
(C) For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, a person's proportionate share of the amount allocated to a transferred share under
paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section is equal to the product of—
(
1
) The amount allocated to the share; and
(
2
) The percentage of the share (by value) that the person owns directly or indirectly immediately after the transfer (taking into account all transactions related to the transfer).
(D) The transferor's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC is decreased by the amount by which another person's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC is increased pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Certain section 381 transactions
—(A)
In general.
If assets of an SFC (the
acquired corporation
) are acquired by another SFC (the
acquiring corporation
) pursuant to a transaction described in section 381(a) in which the acquired corporation is the transferor corporation for purposes of section 381, then a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the acquiring corporation is increased by the balance of its extraordinary disposition account with respect to the acquired corporation, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends and before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A).
(B)
Certain triangular asset reorganizations.
If, in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the section 245A shareholder receives stock of a domestic corporation that controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) the acquiring corporation, the domestic corporation's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the acquiring corporation is increased by the balance of the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the acquired corporation, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends and before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B).
(iii)
Certain distributions involving section 355 or 356.
In the case of a transaction involving a distribution under section 355 (or so much of section 356 as it relates to section 355) by an SFC (the
distributing corporation
) of stock of another SFC (the
controlled corporation
), a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the distributing corporation is attributed to (and treated as) an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the controlled corporation in a manner similar to how earnings and profits of the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation are adjusted under § 1.312-10. To the extent that a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the distributing CFC is not so attributed to (and treated as) an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the controlled corporation, the extraordinary disposition account remains as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the distributing corporation.
(iv)
Transfer of all of the stock of the SFC owned by a section 245A shareholder
—(A)
In general.
If, in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section, a section 245A shareholder of an SFC transfers directly or indirectly all of the stock of the SFC that it owns directly or indirectly, then, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, any remaining balance of the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account that is not allocated or attributed under paragraph (c) of this section is eliminated and therefore not taken into account by any person.
(B)
Related party retains the extraordinary distribution account.
If any related party with respect to the section 245A shareholder described in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A) of this section is a section 245A shareholder with respect to the SFC immediately after the transfer (taking into account all transactions related to the transfer), then the remaining balance of the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC is added to the related party's extraordinary disposition account. If multiple related parties are section 245A shareholders of the SFC, then the remaining balance of the extraordinary disposition account is allocated between the related parties in proportion to the value of the stock of the SFC that they own directly or indirectly immediately after the transfer (taking
into account all transactions related to the transfer).
(v)
Effect of section 338(g) election
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(v)(B) of this section, if an election under section 338(g) is made with respect to a qualified stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)) of stock of an SFC, then a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the old target (as defined in § 1.338-2(c)(17)) is not treated as (or attributed to) an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the new target (as defined in § 1.338-2(c)(17)). Accordingly, the remaining balance of the old target's extraordinary disposition account is eliminated and is not thereafter taken into account by any person.
(B)
Special rules regarding carryover foreign target stock.
If an election under section 338(g) is made with respect to a qualified stock purchase (as described in section 338(d)(3)) of stock of an SFC and there are one or more shares of carryover foreign target stock (“FT stock”) (as described in § 1.338-9(b)(3)(i)), then the following rules apply as to a section 245A shareholder of the new target that after the qualified stock purchase directly or indirectly owns carryover FT stock (such shareholder, the
carryover FT stock shareholder
):
(
1
) In a case in which before the qualified stock purchase the carryover FT stock shareholder directly or indirectly owned carryover FT stock, the carryover FT stock shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the old target, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends, is treated as its extraordinary disposition account with respect to the new target.
(
2
) In a case in which before the qualified stock purchase the carryover FT stock shareholder did not directly or indirectly own carryover FT stock, but the stock retains its character as carryover FT stock (taking into account § 1.338-9(b)(3)(vi)), a ratable portion of each section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the old target, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends, is treated as the carryover FT stock shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the new target, based on the value of the carryover FT stock that the carryover FT stock shareholder owns directly or indirectly after the qualified stock purchase relative to the value of all of the stock of the new target.
(vi)
Certain transfers described in § 1.1248-8(a)(1)
—(A)
In general.
If a person transfers stock of an SFC with respect to which a section 245A shareholder has an extraordinary disposition account to a foreign acquiring corporation in a transaction described § 1.1248-8(a)(1) (other than a transfer that is also described in § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) or (3)) in which stock of a foreign corporation is received by the transferor, then, except in the case in which the transfer is also described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is not adjusted under this paragraph (c)(4).
(B)
Certain transfers described in § 1.1248(f)-1(b).
In the case of a transfer directly or indirectly of stock of an SFC by a section 245A shareholder described in § 1.1248(f)-1(b)(2) or (3), but which does not result in an income inclusion, in whole or in part, by reason of § 1.1248-2, the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC, determined after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section by reason of dividends and before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(B), is allocated and adjusted in the same manner as under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, except that, for purposes of applying paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, stock of the SFC that is owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not section 1248 shareholders (as defined in § 1.1248(f)-1(c)(12)) is disregarded.
(vii)
Anti-abuse rule.
Pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, if a principal purpose of a transaction or series of transactions is to shift to another person, or to avoid, an amount of a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to an SFC or otherwise avoid the purposes of this section, then appropriate adjustments are made for purposes of this
section, including disregarding the transaction or series of transactions. A principal purpose described in the preceding sentence is deemed to exist if stock of an SFC is directly or indirectly acquired by one of more section 245A shareholders within one year of a transaction or transactions to which paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A) of this section would otherwise apply.
(d)
Limitation of amount eligible for section 954(c)(6) when there is an extraordinary disposition account with respect to a lower-tier CFC
—(1)
In general.
If an upper-tier CFC receives a dividend from a lower-tier CFC, then the dividend is eligible for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) (provided all other applicable requirements are satisfied) with respect to the portion of the dividend that exceeds the disqualified amount. With respect to the portion of the dividend that does not exceed the disqualified amount, the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) is allowed (provided all other applicable requirements are satisfied) only for the amount equal to 50 percent of the portion of the dividend that does not exceed the disqualified amount. The disqualified amount is the quotient of the amounts described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The sum of each section 245A shareholder's tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to the lower-tier CFC.
(ii) The percentage of stock of the upper-tier CFC (by value) owned, in the aggregate, by U.S. tax residents that include in gross income their pro rata share of the upper-tier CFC's subpart F income under section 951(a) on the last day of the upper-tier CFC's taxable year. If a U.S. tax resident is a direct or indirect partner in a domestic partnership that is a United States shareholder of the upper-tier CFC, the amount of stock owned by the U.S. tax resident for purposes of the preceding sentence is determined under the principles of paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(2)
Definition of tiered extraordinary disposition amount
—(i)
In general.
The term
tiered extraordinary disposition amount
means, with respect to a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from a lower-tier CFC and a section 245A shareholder, the portion of the dividend that would be an extraordinary disposition amount if the section 245A shareholder received as a dividend its pro rata share of the dividend from the lower-tier CFC. The preceding sentence does not apply to an amount treated as a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from a lower-tier CFC by reason of section 964(e)(4) (in such case, see paragraphs (b)(1) and (g)(2) of this section).
(ii)
Section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC.
For the purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of the amount of a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from a lower-tier CFC equals the amount by which the dividend would increase the section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of the upper-tier CFC's subpart F income under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e) if the dividend were included in the upper-tier CFC's foreign personal holding company income under section 951(a)(1), determined without regard to section 952(c) and as if the upper-tier CFC had no deductions properly allocable to the dividend under section 954(b)(5).
(e)
Extraordinary reduction amount
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the term
extraordinary reduction amount
means, with respect to a dividend received by a controlling section 245A shareholder from a CFC during a taxable year of the CFC ending after December 31, 2017, in which an extraordinary reduction occurs with respect to the controlling section 245A shareholder's ownership of the CFC, the lesser of the amounts described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
See
paragraphs (j)(4) through (6) of this section for examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (e).
(i) The amount of the dividend.
(ii) The amount equal to the sum of the controlling section 245A shareholder's pre-reduction pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income (as defined in section 952(a)) and tested income (as defined in section 951A(c)(2)(A)) for the taxable year, reduced, but not below
zero, by the prior extraordinary reduction amount.
(2)
Rules regarding extraordinary reduction amounts
—(i)
Extraordinary reduction
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, an
extraordinary reduction
occurs, with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholder's ownership of a CFC during a taxable year of the CFC, if either of the conditions described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section is satisfied. See paragraphs (j)(4) and (5) of this section for examples illustrating an extraordinary reduction.
(
1
) The condition of this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) requires that during the taxable year, the controlling section 245A shareholder transfers directly or indirectly (other than by reason of a transfer occurring pursuant to an exchange described in section 368(a)(1)(E) or (F)), in the aggregate, more than 10 percent (by value) of the stock of the CFC that the section 245A shareholder owns directly or indirectly as of the beginning of the taxable year of the CFC, provided the stock transferred, in the aggregate, represents at least 5 percent (by value) of the outstanding stock of the CFC as of the beginning of the taxable year of the CFC; or
(
2
) The condition of this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) requires that, as a result of one or more transactions occurring during the taxable year, the percentage of stock (by value) of the CFC that the controlling section 245A shareholder owns directly or indirectly as of the close of the last day of the taxable year of the CFC is less than 90 percent of the percentage of stock (by value) that the controlling section 245A shareholder owns directly or indirectly on either of the dates described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section (such percentage, the
initial percentage
), provided the difference between the initial percentage and percentage at the end of the year is at least five percentage points.
(B)
Dates for purposes of the initial percentage.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section, the dates described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section are—
(
1
) The day of the taxable year on which the controlling section 245A shareholder owns directly or indirectly its highest percentage of stock (by value) of the CFC; and
(
2
) The day immediately before the first day on which stock was transferred directly or indirectly in the preceding taxable year in a transaction (or a series of transactions) occurring pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of stock (by value) of the CFC that the controlling section 245A shareholder owns directly or indirectly.
(C)
Transactions pursuant to which CFC's taxable year ends.
A controlling section 245A shareholder's direct or indirect transfer of stock of a CFC that but for this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) would give rise to an extraordinary reduction under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not give rise to an extraordinary reduction if the taxable year of the CFC ends immediately after the transfer, provided that the controlling section 245A shareholder directly or indirectly owns the stock on the last day of such year. Thus, for example, if a controlling section 245A shareholder exchanges all the stock of a CFC pursuant to a complete liquidation of the CFC, the exchange does not give rise to an extraordinary reduction.
(ii)
Rules for determining pre-reduction pro rata share
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the term
pre-reduction pro rata share
means, with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholder and the subpart F income or tested income of a CFC, the controlling section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income or tested income under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e) or section 951A(e)(1) and § 1.951A-1(d)(1), respectively, determined based on the controlling section 245A shareholder's direct or indirect ownership of stock of the CFC immediately before the extraordinary reduction (or, if the extraordinary reduction occurs by reason of multiple transactions, immediately before the first transaction) and without regard to section 951(a)(2)(B) and § 1.951-1(b)(1)(ii), but only to the extent that such subpart F income or tested income is not included in the controlling section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income or tested income under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-
1(b) and (e) or section 951A(e)(1) and § 1.951A-1(d)(1), respectively.
(B)
Decrease in section 245A shareholder's pre-reduction pro rata share for amounts taken into account by U.S. tax resident.
A controlling section 245A shareholder's pre-reduction pro rata share of subpart F income or tested income of a CFC for a taxable year is reduced by an amount equal to the sum of the amounts by which each U.S. tax resident's pro rata share of the subpart F income or tested income is increased as a result of a transfer directly or indirectly of stock of the CFC by the controlling section 245A shareholder or an issuance of stock by the CFC (such an amount with respect to a U.S. tax resident, a
specified amount
), in either case, during the taxable year in which the extraordinary reduction occurs. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B), if there are extraordinary reductions with respect to more than one controlling section 245A shareholder during the CFC's taxable year, then a U.S. tax resident's specified amount attributable to an acquisition of stock from the CFC is prorated with respect to each controlling section 245A shareholder based on its relative decrease in ownership of the CFC. See paragraph (j)(5) of this section for an example illustrating a decrease in a section 245A shareholder's pre-reduction pro rata share for amounts taken into account by a U.S. tax resident.
(C)
Prior extraordinary reduction amount.
The term
prior extraordinary reduction amount
means, with respect to a CFC and section 245A shareholder and a taxable year of the CFC in which an extraordinary reduction occurs, the sum of the extraordinary reduction amount of each prior dividend received by the section 245A shareholder from the CFC during the taxable year. A section 245A shareholder's prior extraordinary reduction amount also includes—
(
1
) A prior dividend received by the section 245A shareholder from the CFC during the taxable year to the extent the dividend was not eligible for the section 245A deduction by reason of section 245A(e) or the holding period requirement of section 246 not being satisfied but would have been an extraordinary reduction amount had this paragraph (e) applied to the dividend;
(
2
) If the CFC is a lower-tier CFC for a portion of the taxable year during which the lower-tier CFC pays any dividend to an upper tier-CFC, the portion of a prior dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from the lower-tier CFC during the taxable year of the lower-tier CFC that, by reason of section 245A(e), was included in the upper-tier CFC's foreign personal holding company income and that by reason of section 951(a) was included in income of the section 245A shareholder, and that would have given rise to a tiered extraordinary reduction amount by reason of paragraph (f) of this section had paragraph (f) applied to the dividend of which the section 245A shareholder would have included a pro rata share of the tiered extraordinary reduction amount in income by reason of section 951(a); and
(
3
) If the CFC is a lower-tier CFC for a portion of the taxable year during which the lower-tier CFC pays any dividend to an upper-tier CFC, the sum of the portion of the tiered extraordinary reduction amount of each prior dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from the lower-tier CFC during the taxable year that is included in income of the section 245A shareholder by reason of section 951(a).
(3)
Exceptions
—(i)
Elective exception to close CFC's taxable year
—(A)
In general.
For a taxable year of a CFC in which an extraordinary reduction occurs with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholder and for which, absent this paragraph (e)(3)(i), there would be an extraordinary reduction amount or tiered extraordinary reduction amount greater than zero, no amount is considered an extraordinary reduction amount or tiered extraordinary reduction amount with respect to the controlling section 245A shareholder if each controlling section 245A shareholder elects, and each U.S. tax resident described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section agrees, pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3)(i), to close the CFC's taxable year for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (and, therefore, as to all shareholders of the CFC) as of the end of the date on
which the extraordinary reduction occurs, or, if the extraordinary reduction occurs by reason of multiple transactions, as of the end of each date on which a transaction forming a part of the extraordinary reduction occurs. Because the determination as to whether there would be an extraordinary reduction amount or tiered extraordinary reduction amount greater than zero is made without regard to this paragraph (e)(3)(i), this determination is made without taking into account any elections that may be available, or other events that may occur, solely by reason of an election described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i), such as the application of section 954(b)(4) to a short taxable year created as a result of the election. If an election is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3)(i), all shareholders of the CFC that are a controlling section 245A shareholder or a U.S. tax resident described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section must file their respective U.S. income tax and information returns consistently with the election. If each controlling section 245A shareholder elects to close the CFC's taxable year, that closing will be treated as a change in accounting period for purposes of the notice requirement in § 1.964-1(c)(3)(iii), treating any controlling section 245A shareholders as controlling domestic shareholders for this purpose. However, the notice described in § 1.964-1(c)(3)(iii) does not need to be provided to persons that are U.S. tax residents described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section. For purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(3)(i), a controlling section 245A shareholder that has an extraordinary reduction (or a transaction forming a part thereof) with respect to a CFC is treated as owning the same amount of stock it owned in the CFC immediately before the extraordinary reduction (or a transaction forming a part thereof) on the end of the date on which the extraordinary reduction occurs (or such transaction forming a part thereof occurs). To the extent that shares of a CFC are treated as owned by a controlling section 245A shareholder as of the close of the CFC's taxable year pursuant to the preceding sentence, such shares are treated as not being owned by any other person as of the close of the CFC's taxable year.
(B)
Allocation of foreign taxes.
If an election is made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) to close a CFC's taxable year and the CFC's taxable year under foreign law (if any) does not close at the end of the date on which the CFC's taxable year closes as a result of the election, foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to such foreign taxable year are allocated between the period of the foreign taxable year that ends with, and the period of the foreign taxable year that begins after, the date on which the CFC's taxable year closes as a result of the election. If there is more than one date on which the CFC's taxable year closes as a result of the election, foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to the foreign taxable year are allocated to all such periods. The allocation is made based on the respective portions of the taxable income of the CFC (as determined under foreign law) for the foreign taxable year that are attributable under the principles of § 1.1502-76(b) to the periods during the foreign taxable year. Foreign taxes allocated to a period under this paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) are treated as paid or accrued by the CFC as of the close of that period.
(C)
Time and manner of making election
—(
1
)
Election by controlling section 245A shareholder.
An election pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) is made and effective if the statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(D) of this section is timely filed (including extensions) by each controlling section 245A shareholder making the election with its original U.S. tax return for the taxable year in which the extraordinary reduction occurs. If a controlling section 245A shareholder is a member of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(h)) and participates in the extraordinary reduction, the agent for such group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77(c)(1)) must file the election described in this paragraph (e)(3) on behalf of such member.
(
2
)
Binding agreement.
Before the filing of the statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(D) of this section, each controlling section 245A shareholder must enter into a written, binding agreement with each U.S. tax resident
that on the end of the date on which the extraordinary reduction occurs (or, if the extraordinary reduction occurs by reason of multiple transactions, each U.S. tax resident that on the end of each date on which a transaction forming a part of the extraordinary reduction occurs) owns directly or indirectly, without regard to the final two sentences of paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section, stock of the CFC and is a United States shareholder with respect to the CFC. In the case of a U.S. tax resident that owns stock of the CFC indirectly through one or more partnerships, the partnership that directly owns the stock of the CFC may enter into the binding agreement on behalf of the U.S. tax resident partner provided that, before the due date of the partner's original Federal income tax return, including extensions, the partner delegated the authority to the partnership to enter into the binding agreement pursuant to a written partnership agreement (within the meaning of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(
h
)). The written, binding agreement must provide that each controlling section 245A shareholder will elect to close the taxable year of the CFC.
(
3
)
Transition rule.
In the case of an extraordinary reduction occurring before August 27, 2020, the statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(D) of this section is considered timely filed if it is attached by each controlling section 245A shareholder to an original or amended return for the taxable year in which the extraordinary reduction occurs. In the case of an amended return, the statement is considered timely filed only if it is filed with an amended return no later than February 23, 2021.
(D)
Form and content of statement.
The statement required by paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section is to be titled “Elective Section 245A Year-Closing Statement.” The statement must—
(
1
) Identify (by name and tax identification number, if any) each controlling section 245A shareholder, each U.S tax resident described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section, and the CFC;
(
2
) State the date of the extraordinary reduction (or, if the extraordinary reduction includes transactions on more than one date, the dates of all such transactions) to which the election applies;
(
3
) State the filing controlling section 245A shareholder's pro rata share of the subpart F income, tested income, and foreign taxes described in section 960 with respect to the stock of the CFC subject to the extraordinary reduction, and, if applicable, the amount of earnings and profits attributable to such stock within the meaning of section 1248, as of the date of the extraordinary reduction;
(
4
) State that each controlling section 245A shareholder and each U.S tax resident described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section have entered into a written, binding agreement to elect to close the CFC's taxable year in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section; and
(
5
) Be filed in the manner, if any, prescribed by forms, publications, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(E)
Consistency requirements.
If multiple extraordinary reductions occur with respect to one or more controlling section 245A shareholders' ownership in a single CFC during one or more taxable years of the CFC, then to the extent those extraordinary reductions occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions, the election described in this paragraph (e)(3) section may be made only if it is made for all such extraordinary reductions with respect to the CFC for which there was an extraordinary reduction amount. Furthermore, if an extraordinary reduction occurs with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholders' ownership in one or more CFCs, then, to the extent those extraordinary reductions occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions, the election described in this paragraph (e)(3) may be made only if it is made for each extraordinary reduction for which there was an extraordinary reduction amount with respect to all of the CFCs that have the same or related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) controlling section 245A shareholders.
(ii)
De minimis subpart F income and tested income.
For a taxable year of a CFC in which an extraordinary reduction occurs, no amount is considered an extraordinary reduction amount (or,
with respect to a lower-tier CFC, a tiered extraordinary reduction amount under paragraph (f) of this section) with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholder of the CFC if the sum of the CFC's subpart F income and tested income (as defined in section 951A(c)(2)(A)) for the taxable year does not exceed the lesser of $50 million or 5 percent of the CFC's total income for the taxable year.
(f)
Limitation of amount eligible for section 954(c)(6) where extraordinary reduction occurs with respect to lower-tier CFC
s—(1)
In general.
If an extraordinary reduction occurs with respect to a lower-tier CFC and an upper-tier CFC receives a dividend from the lower-tier CFC in the taxable year in which the extraordinary reduction occurs, then the dividend is eligible for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) (provided all other applicable requirements are satisfied) only with respect to the portion of the dividend that exceeds the tiered extraordinary reduction amount. The preceding sentence does not apply to an amount treated as a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC by reason of section 964(e)(4) (in this case, see paragraphs (b)(1) and (g)(2) of this section). See paragraph (j)(7) of this section for an example illustrating the application of this paragraph (f)(1).
(2)
Definition of tiered extraordinary reduction amount.
The term
tiered extraordinary reduction amount
means, with respect to the portion of a dividend received by an upper-tier CFC from a lower-tier CFC during a taxable year of the lower-tier CFC, the amount of such dividend equal to the excess, if any, of—
(i) The product of—
(A) The sum of the amount of the subpart F income and tested income of the lower-tier CFC for the taxable year; and
(B) The percentage (by value) of stock of the lower-tier CFC owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)) by the upper-tier CFC immediately before the extraordinary reduction (or the first transaction forming a part thereof); over
(ii) The following amounts—
(A) The sum of each U.S. tax resident's pro rata share of the lower-tier CFC's subpart F income and tested income under section 951(a) or 951A(a), respectively, that is attributable to shares of the lower-tier CFC owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)) by the upper-tier CFC immediately prior to the extraordinary reduction (or the first transaction forming a part thereof), computed without the application of this paragraph (f);
(B) The sum of each prior tiered extraordinary reduction amount and sum of each amount included in an upper-tier CFC's subpart F income by reason of section 245A(e) with respect to prior dividends from the lower-tier CFC during the taxable year;
(C) The sum of each U.S. tax resident's pro rata share of an upper-tier CFC's subpart F income under section 951(a) and § 1.951-1(e) that is attributable to dividends received from the lower-tier CFC in the taxable year of the extraordinary reduction that do not qualify for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) because the dividends, or portions thereof, are properly allocable to subpart F income of the lower-tier CFC for the taxable year of the extraordinary reduction pursuant to section 954(c)(6)(A);
(D) The sum of the prior extraordinary reduction amounts (but, for this purpose, computed without regard to amounts described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section) of each controlling section 245A shareholder with respect to shares of the lower-tier CFC that were owned by such controlling section 245A shareholder (including indirectly through a specified entity other than a foreign corporation) for a portion of the taxable year but are owned by an upper-tier CFC (including indirectly through a specified entity other than a foreign corporation) at the time of the distribution of the dividend; and
(E) The product of the amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section and the sum of the amounts of each U.S. tax resident's pro rata share of subpart F income and tested income for the taxable year under section 951(a) or 951A(a), respectively, attributable to shares of the lower-tier CFC
directly or indirectly acquired by the U.S. tax resident from the lower-tier CFC during the taxable year.
(3)
Transition rule for computing tiered extraordinary reduction amount.
Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f) in taxable years of a lower-tier CFC beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and ending before June 14, 2019, a tiered extraordinary reduction amount is determined by treating the lower-tier CFC's subpart F income for the taxable year as if it were neither subpart F income nor tested income.
(g)
Special rules.
The rules in this paragraph (g) apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Source of dividends.
A dividend received by any person is considered received directly by such person from the foreign corporation whose earnings and profits give rise to the dividend. Therefore, for example, if a section 245A shareholder sells or exchanges stock of an upper-tier CFC and the gain recognized on the sale or exchange is included in the gross income of the section 245A shareholder as a dividend under section 1248(a), then, to the extent the dividend is attributable under section 1248(c)(2) to the earnings and profits of a lower-tier CFC owned, within the meaning of section 958(a)(2), by the section 245A shareholder through the upper-tier CFC, the dividend is considered received directly by the section 245A shareholder from the lower-tier CFC.
(2)
Certain section 964(e) inclusions treated as dividends.
An amount included in the gross income of a section 245A shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 964(e)(4) is considered a dividend received by the section 245A shareholder directly from the foreign corporation whose earnings and profits give rise to the amount described in section 964(e)(1). Therefore, for example, if an upper-tier CFC sells or exchanges stock of a lower-tier CFC, and, as a result of the sale or exchange, a section 245A shareholder with respect to the upper-tier CFC includes an amount in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 964(e)(4), then the inclusion is treated as a dividend received directly by the section 245A shareholder from the lower-tier CFC whose earnings and profits give rise to the dividend, and the section 245A shareholder is not allowed a section 245A deduction for the dividend to the extent of the ineligible amount of such dividend.
(3)
Rules regarding stock ownership and stock transfers
—(i)
Determining indirect ownership of stock of an SFC or a CFC.
For purposes of this section, if a person owns an interest in, or stock of, a specified entity, including through a chain of ownership of one or more other specified entities, then the person is considered to own indirectly a pro rata share of stock of an SFC or a CFC owned by the specified entity. To determine a person's pro rata share of stock owned by a specified entity, the principles of section 958(a) apply without regard to whether the specified entity is foreign or domestic.
(ii)
Determining indirect transfers for stock owned indirectly.
If, under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, a person is considered to own indirectly stock of an SFC or CFC that is owned by a specified entity, then the following rules apply in determining if the person transfers stock of the SFC or CFC—
(A) To the extent the specified entity transfers stock that is considered owned indirectly by the person immediately before the transfer, the person is considered to transfer indirectly such stock;
(B) If the person transfers an interest in, or stock of, the specified entity, then the person is considered to transfer indirectly the stock of the SFC or CFC attributable to the interest in, or the stock of, the specified entity that is transferred; and
(C) In the case in which the person owns the specified entity through a chain of ownership of one or more other specified entities, if there is a transfer of an interest in, or stock of, another specified entity in the chain of ownership, then the person is considered to transfer indirectly the stock of the SFC or CFC attributable to the interest in, or the stock of, the other specified entity transferred.
(iii)
Definition of specified entity.
The term
specified entity
means any partnership, trust (other than a trust treated as a corporation for U.S. income tax
purposes), or estate (in each case, domestic or foreign), or any foreign corporation.
(4)
Coordination rules
—(i)
General rule.
A dividend is first subject to section 245A(e). To the extent the dividend is not a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend under section 245A(e), the dividend is subject to paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, as applicable, and then, to the extent the dividend is not subject to paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, it is subject to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable.
(ii)
Coordination rule for paragraphs (c) and (d) and (e) and (f) of this section, respectively.
If an SFC or CFC pays a dividend (or simultaneous dividends), a portion of which may be subject to paragraph (c) or (e) of this section and a portion of which may be subject to paragraph (d) or (f) of this section, the rules of this section apply by treating the portion of the dividend or dividends that may be subject to paragraph (c) or (e) of this section as if it occurred immediately before the portion of the dividend or dividends that may be subject to paragraph (d) or (f) of this section. For example, if a dividend arising under section 964(e)(4) occurs at the same time as a dividend that would be eligible for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) but for the potential application of paragraph (d) this section, then the tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to the other dividend is determined as if the dividend arising under section 964(e)(4) occurs immediately before the other dividend.
(5)
Ordering rule for multiple dividends made by an SFC or a CFC during a taxable year.
If an SFC or a CFC pays dividends on more than one date during its taxable year or at different times on the same date, this section applies based on the order in which the dividends are paid.
(6)
Partner's distributive share of a domestic partnership's pro rata share of subpart F income or tested income.
If a section 245A shareholder or a U.S. tax resident is a direct or indirect partner in a domestic partnership that is a United States shareholder with respect to a CFC and includes in gross income its distributive share of the domestic partnership's inclusion under section 951(a) or 951A(a) with respect to the CFC then, solely for purposes of this section, a reference to the section 245A shareholder's or U.S. tax resident's pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income or tested income included in gross income under section 951(a) or 951A(a), respectively, includes such person's distributive share of the domestic partnership's pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income or tested income. A person is an indirect partner with respect to a domestic partnership if the person indirectly owns the domestic partnership through one or more specified entities (other than a foreign corporation).
(7)
Related domestic corporations treated as a single domestic corporation for certain purposes.
For purposes of determining the extent that a dividend is an extraordinary disposition amount or a tiered extraordinary disposition amount, as well as for purposes of determining the extent to which an extraordinary disposition account is reduced by a prior extraordinary disposition amount, domestic corporations that are related parties are treated as a single domestic corporation. Thus, for example, if two domestic corporations are related parties and either or both of them are section 245A shareholders with respect to an SFC, then the extent to which a dividend received by either domestic corporation from the SFC is an extraordinary disposition amount is based on the sum of each domestic corporation's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC. When, by reason of this paragraph (g)(7), the extent to which a dividend is an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount is determined based on the sum of two or more extraordinary disposition accounts, a pro rata amount in each extraordinary disposition account is considered to give rise to the extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount, if any.
(h)
Anti-abuse rule.
Appropriate adjustments are made pursuant to this section, including adjustments that would disregard a transaction or arrangement in whole or in part, to any amounts determined under (or subject
to the application of) this section if a transaction or arrangement is engaged in with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section. For examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (h), see paragraphs (j)(8) through (10) of this section.

If section 964(e)(4) applies to a sale or exchange of a lower-tier CFC with respect to a controlling section 245A shareholder, all United States shareholders of the CFC are considered to act in concert with regard to the sale or exchange. In addition, if all persons selling stock in a CFC, held directly, sell such stock to the same buyer or buyers (or a related party with respect to the buyer or buyers) as part of the same plan, all sellers will be considered to act in concert with regard to the sale or exchange.

(i) US1 and US2 are domestic corporations, each with a calendar taxable year, and are not related parties with respect to each other.
(ii) CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 are foreign corporations that are SFCs and CFCs.
(iii) Each entity uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
(iv) Year 2 begins on or after January 1, 2018 and has 365 days.
(v) Absent application of this section, dividends received by US1 and US2 from a CFC meet the requirements to qualify for the section 245A deduction, and dividends received by one CFC from another CFC qualify for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6).
(vi) The de minimis rules in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(E) and (e)(3)(ii) of this section do not apply.

(2)
Example 1. Extraordinary disposition
—(i)
Facts.
US1 and US2 own 60% and 40%, respectively, of the single class of stock of CFC1. CFC1 owns all of the single class of stock of CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 use the taxable year ending November 30 as their taxable year. On November 1, 2018, CFC1 sells specified property to CFC2 in exchange for $200x of cash (the “Property Transfer”). The Property Transfer is outside of CFC1's ordinary course of activities. The transferred property has a basis of $100x in the hands of CFC1. CFC1 recognizes $100x of gain as a result of the Property Transfer ($200x − $100x). On December 1, 2018, CFC1 distributes $80x pro rata to US1 ($48x) and US2 ($32x), all of which is a dividend within the meaning of section 316 and treated as a distribution out of earnings described in section 959(c)(3). No other distributions are made by CFC1 to either US1 or US2 in CFC1's taxable year ending November 30, 2019. For its taxable year ending on November 30, 2019, CFC1 has $110x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3), without regard to any distributions during the taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Identification of extraordinary disposition.
Because CFC1 is a CFC and uses the taxable year ending on November 30, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, it has a disqualified period beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending on November 30, 2018. In addition, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Property Transfer is an extraordinary disposition because it: Is a disposition of specified property by CFC1 on a date on which it was a CFC and during CFC1's disqualified period; is to CFC2, a related party with respect to CFC1; occurs outside of the ordinary course of CFC1's activities; and, is not subject to the de minimis rule in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section.
(B)
Determination of section 245A shareholders and their extraordinary disposition accounts.
Because CFC1 undertook an extraordinary disposition, under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a portion of CFC1's earnings
and profits are extraordinary disposition E
P and, therefore, give rise to an extraordinary disposition account with respect to each of CFC1's section 245A shareholders. Under paragraph (i)(21) of this section, US1 and US2 are both section 245A shareholders with respect to CFC1. The amount of the extraordinary disposition account with respect to US1 is $60x, which is equal to the product of the extraordinary disposition E
P (the amount of the net gain recognized by CFC1 as a result of the Property Transfer ($100x)) and the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage (the percentage of the stock of CFC1 owned directly or indirectly by US1 on January 1, 2018 (60%)), reduced by the prior extraordinary disposition amount ($0).
See
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Similarly, the amount of the extraordinary disposition account with respect to US2 is $40x, which is equal to the product of the extraordinary disposition E
P (the net gain recognized by CFC1 as a result of the Property Transfer ($100x)) and extraordinary disposition ownership percentage (the percentage of the stock of CFC1 owned directly or indirectly by US2 on January 1, 2018 (40%)), reduced by the prior extraordinary disposition amount ($0).
(C)
Determination of extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US1.
The dividend of $48x paid to US1 on December 1, 2018, is an extraordinary disposition amount to the extent the dividend is paid out of the extraordinary disposition account with respect to US1.
See
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the dividend is first considered paid out of non-extraordinary disposition E
P with respect to US1, to the extent thereof. With respect to US1, $6x of CFC1's earnings and profits is non-extraordinary disposition E
P, calculated as the excess of $66x (the product of $110x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3), without regard to the $80x distribution, and 60%) over $60x (the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, immediately before the distribution).
See
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, $6x of the dividend is considered paid out of non-extraordinary disposition E
P with respect to US1. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the remaining $42x of the dividend is next considered paid out of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, to the extent thereof. Accordingly, $42x of the dividend is considered paid out of the extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 and gives rise to $42x of an extraordinary disposition amount. As a result, US1's prior extraordinary disposition amount is increased by $42x under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, and US1's extraordinary disposition account is reduced to $18x ($60x − $42x) under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(D)
Determination of extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US2.
The dividend of $32x paid to US2, on December 1, 2018, is an extraordinary disposition amount to the extent the dividend is paid out of extraordinary disposition E
P with respect to US2.
See
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the dividend is first considered paid out of non-extraordinary disposition E
P with respect to US2, to the extent thereof. With respect to US2, $4x of CFC1's earnings and profits is non-extraordinary disposition E
P, calculated as the excess of $44x (the product of $110x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3), without regard to the $80x distribution, and 40%) over $40x (the balance of US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, immediately before the distribution).
See
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, $4x of the dividend is considered paid out of non-extraordinary disposition E
P with respect to US2. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the remaining $28x of the dividend is next considered paid out of US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, to the extent thereof. Accordingly, $28x of the dividend is considered paid out of the extraordinary disposition account with respect to US2 and gives rise to $28x of an extraordinary disposition amount. As a result, US2's prior extraordinary disposition amount is increased by $28x under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, and US2's extraordinary disposition account is reduced to $12x ($40x − $28x) under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(E)
Determination of ineligible amount with respect to US1 and US2.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with respect to US1 and the dividend of $48x, the ineligible amount is $21x, the sum of 50 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount ($42x) and extraordinary reduction amount ($0). Therefore, with respect to the dividend received by US1 of $48x, $27x is eligible for a section 245A deduction. With respect to US2 and the dividend of $32x, the ineligible amount is $14x, the sum of 50% of the extraordinary disposition amount ($28x) and extraordinary reduction amount ($0). Therefore, with respect to the dividend received by US2 of $32x, $18x is eligible for a section 245A deduction.

Example 2. Application of section 954(c)(6) exception with extraordinary disposition account
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that the Property Transfer is a sale by CFC2 to CFC1 instead of a sale by CFC1 to CFC2, the $80x distribution is by CFC2 to CFC1 in a separate transaction that is unrelated to the Property Transfer, and the description of the earnings and profits of CFC1 is applied to CFC2. Additionally, absent the application of this section, section 954(c)(6) would apply to the distribution by CFC2 to CFC1. Under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e), US1's pro rata share of any subpart F income of CFC1 is 60% and
US2's pro rata share of any subpart F income of CFC2 is 40%.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Identification of extraordinary disposition.
The Property Transfer is an extraordinary disposition under the same analysis as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
).
(B)
Determination of section 245A shareholders and their extraordinary disposition accounts.
Both US1 and US2 are section 245A shareholders with respect to CFC2, US1 has an extraordinary disposition account of $60x with respect to CFC2, and US2 has an extraordinary disposition account of $40x with respect to CFC2 under the same analysis as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
).

US1 and US2 each have a tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to the $80x dividend paid by CFC2 to CFC1 to the extent that US1 and US2 would have an extraordinary disposition amount if each had received as a dividend its pro rata share of the dividend from CFC2.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, US1's pro rata share of the dividend is $48x (60% × $80x), that is, the increase to US1's pro rata share of the subpart F income if the dividend were included in CFC1's foreign personal holding company income, without regard to section 952(c) and the allocation of expenses. Similarly, US2's pro rata share of the dividend is $32x (40% × $80x).

Determination of tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US1.
The extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US1 is $42x, under the same analysis provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
). Accordingly, the tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US1 is $42x.

)
Determination of extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US2.
The extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US2 is $28x, under the same analysis provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(D) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
). Accordingly, the tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US2 is $28x.
(D)
Limitation of section 954(c)(6) exception.
The sum of US1 and US2's tiered extraordinary disposition amounts is $70x ($42x + $28x). The portion of the stock of CFC1 (by value) owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by U.S. tax residents on the last day of CFC1's taxable year is 100%. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the disqualified amount with respect to the dividend is $70x ($70x/100%). Accordingly, the portion of the $80x dividend from CFC2 to CFC1 that is eligible for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) is $45x, equal to the sum of $10x (the portion of the $80x dividend that exceeds the $70x disqualified amount) and $35x (50 percent of $70x, the portion of the dividend that does not exceed the disqualified amount). Under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e), US1 includes $21x (60% × $35x) and US2 includes $14x (40% × $35x) in income under section 951(a).
(E)
Changes in extraordinary disposition account of US1.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D)(

Example 3. Extraordinary reduction
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of CFC1's taxable year ending on December 31, Year 2, US1 owns all of the single class of stock of CFC1, and no person transferred any CFC1 stock directly or indirectly in Year 1 pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 owned by US1. Also as of the beginning of Year 2, CFC1 has no earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2), and US1 does not have an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1. As of the end of Year 2, CFC1 has $160x of tested income and no other income. CFC1 has $160x of earnings and profits for Year 2. On October 19, Year 2, US1 sells all of its CFC1 stock to US2 for $100x in a transaction (the “Stock Sale”) in which US1 recognizes $90x of gain. Under section 1248(a), the entire $90x of gain is included in US1's gross income as a dividend and, pursuant to section 1248(j), the $90x is treated as a dividend for purposes of applying section 245A. At the end of Year 2, under section 951A, US2 takes into account $70x of tested income, calculated as $160x (100% of the $160x of tested income) less $90x, the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B). The amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) is the lesser of $90x, the amount of dividends received by US1 with respect to the transferred stock, and $128x, the amount of tested
income attributable to the transferred stock ($160x) multiplied by 292/365 (the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that US2 did not own the transferred stock to the total number of days in Year 2). US1 does not make an election pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determination of controlling section 245A shareholder and extraordinary reduction of ownership.
Under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, US1 is a controlling section 245A shareholder with respect to CFC1. In addition, the Stock Sale results in an extraordinary reduction with respect to US1's ownership of CFC1.
See
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. The extraordinary reduction occurs because during Year 2, US1 transferred 100% of the CFC1 stock it owned at the beginning of the year and such amount is more than 5% of the total value of the stock of CFC1 at the beginning of Year 2; it also occurs because on the last day of the year the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 owns directly or indirectly (0%) (the end of year percentage) is less than 90% of the stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 owns directly or indirectly on the day of the taxable year when it owned the highest percentage of CFC1 stock by value (100%) (the initial percentage), no transactions occurred in the preceding year pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of CFC1 stock owned by US1, and the difference between the initial percentage and the end of year percentage (100 percentage points) is at least 5 percentage points.
(B)
Determination of extraordinary reduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the entire $90x dividend to US1 is an extraordinary reduction amount with respect to US1 because the dividend is at least equal to US1's pre-reduction pro rata share of CFC1's Year 2 tested income described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section ($160x), reduced by the amount of tested income taken into account by US2, a U.S. tax resident, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section ($70x).
(C)
Determination of ineligible amount.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with respect to US1 and the dividend of $90x, the ineligible amount is $90x, the sum of 50% of the extraordinary disposition amount ($0) and extraordinary reduction amount ($90x). Therefore, with respect to the dividend received of $90x, no portion is eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed under section 245A(a).
(iii)
Alternative facts—election to close CFC's taxable year.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section (the facts of this
Example 3
), except that, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, US1 elects to close CFC1's Year 2 taxable year for all purposes of the Code as of the end of October 19, Year 2, the date on which the Stock Sale occurs; in addition, US1 and US2 enter into a written, binding agreement that US1 will elect to close CFC1's Year 2 taxable year. Accordingly, under section 951A(a), US1 takes into account 100% of CFC1's tested income for the taxable year beginning January 1, Year 2, and ending October 19, Year 2, and US2 takes into account 100% of CFC1's tested income for the taxable year beginning October 20, Year 2, and ending December 31, Year 2. Under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section, no amount is considered an extraordinary reduction amount with respect to US1.

Example 4. Extraordinary reduction; decrease in section 245A shareholder's pre-reduction pro rata share for amounts taken into account by U.S. tax residents
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of CFC1's taxable year ending December 31, Year 2, US1 owns all of the single class of stock of CFC1, and no person transferred any CFC1 stock directly or indirectly in Year 1 pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 owned by US1. CFC1 generates $120x of subpart F income during its taxable year ending on December 31, Year 2. On October 1, Year 2, CFC1 distributes a $120x dividend to US1. On October 19, Year 2, US1 sells 100% of its stock of CFC1 to PRS, a domestic partnership, in a transaction in which no gain or loss is realized (the “Stock Sale”). A, an individual who is a citizen of the United States, and B, a foreign individual who is not a U.S. tax resident, each own 50% of the capital and profits interests of PRS. On December 1, Year 2, US2 and FP, a foreign corporation, contribute property to CFC1; in exchange, each of US2 and FP receives 25% of the stock of CFC1. PRS owns the remaining 50% of the stock of CFC1. US1 does not make an election pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determination of controlling section 245A shareholder and extraordinary reduction.
Under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, US1 is a controlling section 245A shareholder with respect to CFC1. In addition, the Stock Sale results in an extraordinary reduction with respect to US1's ownership of CFC1.
See
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. The extraordinary reduction occurs because during Year 2, US1 transferred 100% of the CFC1 stock it owns on the first day of Year 2, and that amount is more than 5% of the total value of the stock of CFC1 at the beginning of Year 2; it also occurs because on the last day of Year 2 the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 owns directly or indirectly (0%) (the end of year percentage) is less than 90% of the highest percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 owns directly or indirectly on the day of the taxable year when it owned the highest percentage of CFC1 stock by value (100%) (the initial percentage), no transactions occurred in the preceding year pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of CFC1 stock owned by US1, and the difference between the initial percentage and the end of year percentage (100
percentage points) is at least 5 percentage points.
(B)
Determination of pre-reduction pro rata share.
Before the extraordinary reduction, US1 owned 100% of the stock of CFC1. Thus, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the tentative amount of US1's pre-reduction pro rata share of CFC1's subpart F income is $120x. A and US2 are U.S. tax residents pursuant to paragraph (i)(29) of this section because they are United States persons described in section 7701(a)(30)(A) or (C). Thus, US1's pre-reduction pro rata share amount is subject to the reduction described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because U.S. tax residents directly or indirectly acquire stock of CFC1 from US1 or CFC1 during the taxable year in which the extraordinary reduction occurs. With respect to US1's pre-reduction pro rata share of CFC1's subpart F income, the reduction equals the amount of subpart F income of CFC1 taken into account under section 951(a) by these U.S. tax residents.
(C)
Determination of decrease in pre-reduction pro rata share for amounts taken into account by U.S. tax resident.
On December 31, Year 2, both PRS and US2 will be United States shareholders with respect to CFC1 and will include in gross income their pro rata share of CFC1's subpart F income under section 951(a). With respect to US2, this amount will be $30x, which is equal to 25% of CFC1's subpart F income for the taxable year. With respect to PRS, its pro rata share of $60x under section 951(a)(2)(A) (50% of $120x) will be reduced under section 951(a)(2)(B) by $48x. The section 951(a)(2)(B) reduction is equal to the lesser of the $120x dividend paid with respect to those shares to US1 or $48x (50% × $120x × 292/365, the period during the taxable year that PRS did not own CFC1 stock). Thus, PRS includes $12x in gross income pursuant to section 951(a). Of this amount, $6x is allocated to A (as a 50% partner of PRS) and, therefore, treated as taken into account by A under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(B) and (g)(6) of this section. Thus, A and US2 take into account a total of $36x of CFC1's subpart F income under section 951(a). This amount reduces US1's pre-reduction pro rata share of CFC1's subpart F income to $84x ($120x−$36x) under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. CFC1 did not generate tested income during the taxable year and, therefore, no amount is taken into account under section 951A with respect to CFC1, and US1 has no pre-reduction pro rata share with respect to tested income of CFC1.
(D)
Determination of extraordinary reduction amount.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the extraordinary reduction amount equals $84x, which is the lesser of the amount of the dividend received by US1 from CFC1 during Year 2 ($120x) and the sum of US1's pre-reduction pro rata share of CFC1's subpart F income ($84x) and tested income ($0).
(E)
Determination of ineligible amount.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with respect to US1 and the dividend of $120x, the ineligible amount is $84x, the sum of 50% of the extraordinary disposition amount ($0) and extraordinary reduction amount ($84x). Therefore, with respect to the dividend received by US1 from CFC1, $36x ($120x−$84x) is eligible for a section 245A deduction.

Example 5. Controlling section 245A shareholder
—(i)
Facts.
US1 and US2 own 30% and 25% of the stock of CFC1, respectively. FP, a foreign corporation that is not a CFC, owns all of the stock of US1 and US2. FP owns the remaining 45% of the stock of CFC1. On September 30, Year 2, US1 sells all of its stock of CFC1 to US3, a domestic corporation that is not a related party with respect to FP, US1, or US2. No person transferred any stock of CFC1 directly or indirectly in Year 1 pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 owned by US1.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (i)(21) of this section, US1 is a section 245A shareholder with respect to CFC1, an SFC. Because US1 owns, together with US2 and FP (related persons with respect to US1), more than 50% of the stock of CFC1, US1 is a controlling section 245A shareholder of CFC1. The sale of US1's CFC1 stock results in an extraordinary reduction occurring with respect to US1's ownership of CFC1. The extraordinary reduction occurs because during Year 2, US1 transferred 100% of the stock of CFC1 that it owned at the beginning of the year and that amount is more than 5% of the total value of the stock of CFC1 at the beginning of Year 2. The extraordinary disposition also occurs because on the last day of the year the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 directly or indirectly owns (0%) (the end of year percentage) is less than 90% of the stock (by value) of CFC1 that US1 directly or indirectly owned on the day of the taxable year when it owned the highest percentage of CFC1 stock by value (30%) (the initial percentage), no transactions occurred in the preceding year pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of CFC1 stock owned by US1, and the difference between the initial percentage and end of year percentage (30 percentage points) is at least 5 percentage points.
(7)
Example 6. Limitation of section 954(c)(6) exception with respect to an extraordinary reduction
—(i)
Facts.
At the beginning of CFC1 and CFC2's taxable year ending on December 31, Year 2, US1 and A, an individual who is a citizen of the United States, own 80% and 20% of the single class of stock of CFC1, respectively. CFC1 owns 100% of the stock of CFC2. Both US1 and A are United States shareholders with respect to CFC1 and CFC2, and US1 and A are not related parties with respect to each other. No person transferred
CFC2 stock directly or indirectly in Year 2 pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC2 owned by US1, and US1 does not have an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2. At the end of Year 2, and without regard to any distributions during Year 2, CFC2 had $150x of tested income and no other income, and CFC1 had no income or expenses. On June 30, Year 2, CFC2 distributed $150x as a dividend to CFC1, which would qualify for the exception from foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) but for the application of this section. On August 7, Year 2, CFC1 sells all of its CFC2 stock to US2 for $100x in a transaction (the “Stock Sale”) in which CFC1 realizes no gain or loss. At the end of Year 2, under section 951A, US2 takes into account $60x of tested income, calculated as $150x (100% of the $150x of tested income) less $90x, the amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B). The amount described in section 951(a)(2)(B) is the lesser of $150x, the amount of dividends received by CFC1 during Year 2 with respect to the transferred stock, and $90x, the amount of tested income attributable to the transferred stock ($150x) multiplied by 219/365 (the ratio of the number of days in Year 2 that US2 did not own the transferred stock to the total number of days in Year 2). US1 does not make an election pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determination of controlling section 245A shareholder and extraordinary reduction of ownership.
Under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, US1 is a controlling section 245A shareholder with respect to CFC2, but A is not. In addition, the Stock Sale results in an extraordinary reduction with respect to US1's ownership of CFC2.
See
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. The extraordinary reduction occurs because during Year 2, US1 transferred indirectly 100% of the CFC2 stock it owned at the beginning of the year and such amount is more than 5% of the total value of the stock of CFC2 at the beginning of Year 2. The extraordinary disposition also occurs because on the last day of the year the percentage of stock (by value) of CFC2 that US1 owns directly or indirectly (0%) (the end of year percentage) is less than 90% of the stock (by value) of CFC2 that US1 owns directly or indirectly on the day of the taxable year when it owned the highest percentage of CFC2 stock by value (80%) (the initial percentage), no transactions occurred in the preceding year pursuant to a plan to reduce the percentage of CFC2 stock owned by US1, and the difference between the initial percentage and the end of year percentage (80 percentage points) is at least 5 percentage points. Because there is an extraordinary reduction with respect to CFC2 in Year 2 and CFC1 received a dividend from CFC2 in Year 2, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, it is necessary to determine the limitation on the amount of the dividend eligible for the exception under section 954(c)(6).
(B)
Determination of tiered extraordinary reduction amount.
The limitation on the amount of the dividend eligible for the exception under section 954(c)(6) is based on the tiered extraordinary reduction amount. The sum of the amount of subpart F income and tested income of CFC2 for Year 2 is $150x, and immediately before the extraordinary reduction, CFC1 held 100% of the stock of CFC2. Additionally, US2 is a U.S. tax resident as defined in paragraph (i)(29) of this section because it is a United States person described in section 7701(a)(30)(A) or (C), and US2 has a pro rata share of $60x of tested income under section 951A with respect to CFC2. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the tiered extraordinary reduction amount is $90x (($150x × 100%) − $60x).
(C)
Limitation of section 954(c)(6) exception.
Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the portion of the $150x dividend from CFC2 to CFC1 that is eligible for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6) is $60x ($150x − $90x). To the extent that the $90x that does not qualify for the exception gives rise to additional subpart F income to CFC1, both US1 and A will take into account their pro rata share of that subpart F income under section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e).
(8)
Example 7. Application of anti-abuse rule to a prepayment of a royalty
—(i)
Facts.
US1 owns 100% of the single class of stock of CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 has a November 30 taxable year, and CFC2 has a calendar year taxable year. There is a license agreement between CFC1 and CFC2 pursuant to which CFC2 is obligated to pay annual royalties to CFC1 for the use of intangible property. As of November 1, 2018, the remaining term of the agreement is 10 years. On November 1, 2018, CFC1 receives from CFC2, and accrues into income, $100x of pre-paid royalties that are for the use of the intangible property for the subsequent 10 years. The form of the arrangement as a license, including the prepayment of the royalty, is respected for U.S. tax purposes; therefore CFC1's receipt of the $100x royalty prepayment does not constitute a disposition of the intangible property and is excluded from CFC1's subpart F income pursuant to section 954(c)(6). A principal purpose of CFC2 prepaying the royalty is for CFC1 to generate earnings and profits during the disqualified period that would not be subject to current U.S. tax yet may be eligible for the section 245A deduction and could, for example, be used to reduce the amount of gain recognized on a disposition of the stock of CFC1 that would be subject to U.S. tax by increasing the portion of such gain treated as a dividend.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the royalty prepayment was carried out with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section,
appropriate adjustments are required to be made under the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (h) of this section. CFC1 is a CFC that has a November 30 taxable year, so under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, CFC1 has a disqualified period beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending on November 30, 2018. In addition, even though the intangible property licensed by CFC1 to CFC2 is specified property, CFC2's prepayment of the royalty would not be treated as a disposition of the specified property by CFC1 and, therefore, would not constitute an extraordinary disposition (and thus would not give rise to extraordinary disposition E
P), absent the application of the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (h) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the earnings and profits of CFC1 generated as a result of the $100x of prepaid royalty are treated as extraordinary disposition E
P for purposes of this section and, therefore, US1 has an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 of $100x. In addition, the prepaid royalty gives rise to a disqualified payment (as defined in § 1.951A-2(c)(6)(ii)(A)) of $100x. As a result, § 1.245A-7(b) or § 1.245A-8(b), as applicable, applies to reduce the disqualified payment in the same manner as if the disqualified payment were disqualified basis, and § 1.245A-7(c) or § 1.245A-8(c), as applicable, applies to reduce the extraordinary disposition account in the same manner as if the deductions directly or indirectly related to the disqualified payment were deductions attributable to disqualified basis of an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account.
(9)
Example 8. Application of anti-abuse rule to restructuring transaction
—(i)
Facts.
FP, a foreign corporation with no United States shareholders, owns 100% of the single class of stock of US1. US1 owns 100% of the single class of stock of CFC1 that, in turn, owns 100% of the single class of stock of CFC2. CFC2 has $100x of extraordinary disposition E
P, and US1 has a $100x extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2. In Year 1, FP transfers property to CFC1 in exchange for newly issued stock of CFC1. After the transfer, FP and US1 own, respectively, 90% and 10% of the single class of stock of CFC1. In Year 3, CFC2 pays a $100x dividend to CFC1, and the dividend gives rise to a tiered extraordinary disposition amount with respect to US1 of $10x. US1 includes $10x in gross income under section 951(a) with respect to the tiered extraordinary disposition amount. The $10x tiered extraordinary disposition amount reduces US1's extraordinary disposition account from $100x to $90x. In Year 5, CFC1 redeems all of the stock of CFC1 held by US1 in exchange for $100x of cash. Under sections 302(d) and 301(c)(1), the redemption results in a $100x dividend to US1. Under section 959(a), $10x of the $100x dividend is not included in US1's gross income and, but for the application of paragraph (h) of this section, US1 would claim a section 245A deduction of $90x with respect to $90x of the dividend. The transfer of property from FP to CFC1 in exchange for stock of CFC1, the $100x dividend from CFC2 to CFC1, and CFC1's redemption of all of its stock held by US1 (together, the “Transaction”) were undertaken with the principal purpose of avoiding the application of this section to distributions from CFC2. As a result of the redemption, CFC2 is wholly owned by FP through CFC1, and CFC2's earnings and profits can be distributed without incurring U.S. tax irrespective of the availability of the section 245A deduction or the exception under section 954(c)(6).
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the Transaction was carried out with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, appropriate adjustments are required to be made under the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (h) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, all $90x of the dividend included in US1's income in Year 5 is treated as an extraordinary disposition amount. Therefore, $45x of the dividend is treated as an ineligible amount for which US1 cannot claim a section 245A deduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (that is, 50% of the extraordinary disposition amount) and, accordingly, US1 is only allowed a section 245A deduction of $45x ($90x dividend received, less the $45x ineligible amount) with respect to the $90x dividend from CFC1 that it included in income. In addition, US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2 is reduced from $90x to zero pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) and (D) of this section.

Example 9. Application of anti-abuse rule to a related-party loan
—(i)
Facts.
US1 owns 100% of the single class of stock of CFC1 and CFC2. US1 does not own stock of any other foreign corporation. US1 intends to repatriate $100x cash from CFC1 at the end of taxable year Y1. At the end of taxable year Y1, CFC1 has $100x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) (all of which is extraordinary disposition E
P) and $100x of cash, and US1 has an extraordinary disposition account balance with respect to CFC1 equal to $100x. In addition, at the end of taxable year Y1, CFC2 has $100x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). US1 does not have an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2. Anticipating the application of this section to a distribution from CFC1, US1 instead causes CFC1 to loan $100x of cash to CFC2 during taxable year Y1 in exchange for a $100x note. The form of the transaction is respected as a loan for U.S. tax purposes. At the end of taxable Y1, CFC2 distributes $100x of cash to US1. The loan and distribution are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to repatriate
CFC1's $100x cash without triggering the application of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the loan from CFC1 to CFC2 and the subsequent distribution of cash were carried out with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, appropriate adjustments are required to be made under the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (h) of this section. Pursuant to that rule, the distribution of $100x of cash is treated as a distribution out of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1. Accordingly, the $100x distribution is taxed as a dividend, and only $50x of the dividend received by US1 is eligible for the section 245A deduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. As a result of the distribution, the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is reduced by $100x to zero pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.

This section applies to taxable periods of a foreign corporation ending on or after June 14, 2019, and to taxable periods of section 245A shareholders in which or with which such taxable periods end. For taxable periods described in the previous sentence, this section (and not § 1.245A-5T) applies regardless of whether, but for this paragraph (k)(1), § 1.245A-5T would apply. See § 1.245A-5T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2020 for distributions occurring after December 31, 2017, as to which this section does not apply.

§ 1.245A-6
Coordination of extraordinary disposition and disqualified basis rules.
(a)
Scope.
This section and §§ 1.245A-7 through 1.245A-11 coordinate the application of the extraordinary disposition rules of § 1.245A-5(c) and (d) and the disqualified basis rule of § 1.951A-2(c)(5). Section 1.245A-7 provides coordination rules for simple cases, and § 1.245A-8 provides coordination rules for complex cases. Section 1.245A-9 provides definitions and other rules, including rules of general applicability for purposes of this section and §§ 1.245A-7 through 1.245A-11. Section 1.245A-10 provides examples illustrating the application of this section and §§ 1.245A-7 through 1.245A-9. Section 1.245A-11 provides applicability dates.
(b)
Conditions to apply coordination rules for simple cases.
For a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied, the section 245A shareholder may apply the coordination rules of § 1.245A-7 (rules for simple cases) to an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC and disqualified basis of an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account (as determined pursuant to § 1.245A-9(b)(1)). If the conditions are not satisfied, then the coordination rules of § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) apply beginning with the first day of the first taxable year of the section 245A shareholder for which the conditions are not satisfied and all taxable years thereafter. If the conditions are satisfied for a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder but the section 245A shareholder chooses not to apply the coordination rules of § 1.245A-7 for that taxable year, then the coordination rules of § 1.245A-8 apply to that taxable year (though, for a subsequent taxable year, the section 245A shareholder may apply the coordination rules of § 1.245A-7, provided that the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied for such subsequent taxable year and have been satisfied for all earlier taxable years). For purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, a reference to a section 245A shareholder, an SFC, or a CFC does not include a successor of the section 245A shareholder, the SFC, or the CFC, respectively.
(1)
Requirements related to the SFC.
The condition of this paragraph (b)(1)
is satisfied for a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder if the following requirements are satisfied:
(i) On January 1, 2018, the section 245A shareholder owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) all of the stock (by vote and value) of the SFC.
(ii) On each day of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, the section 245A shareholder owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) all of the stock (by vote and value) of the SFC.
(iii) On no day during the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder was the SFC a distributing or controlled corporation in a transaction described in a section 355, or did the SFC acquire the assets of a corporation as to which there is an extraordinary disposition account pursuant to a transaction described in section 381 (that is, taking into account the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC has not been not been adjusted pursuant to the rules of § 1.245A-5(c)(4)).
(2)
Requirements related to an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account and a CFC holding the item.
The condition of this paragraph (b)(2) is satisfied for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder if the following requirements are satisfied:
(i) For each item of specified property with disqualified basis that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account, the item of specified property is held by a CFC immediately after the extraordinary disposition of the item of specified property.
(ii) For each CFC described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section—
(A) All of the stock (by vote and value) of the CFC is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates of the section 245A shareholder immediately after the extraordinary disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;
(B) For each taxable year of the CFC that ends with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, there is no extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC, and the sum of the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts (as described in § 1.245A(e)-1(d)(1)) with respect to shares of stock of the CFC is zero (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year); and
(C) On each day of each taxable year of the CFC that ends with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, and on each day of each taxable year of the CFC that begins with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder—
(
1
) The CFC holds the item of specified property described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;
(
2
) The section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) all of the stock (by vote and value) of the CFC;
(
3
) The CFC does not hold any item of specified property with disqualified basis other than an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account;
(
4
) The CFC does not own an interest in a partnership, trust, or estate (directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships, trusts, or estates) that holds an item of specified property with disqualified basis; and
(
5
) The CFC is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and therefore does not have ECTI, and the CFC does not have any deficit in earnings and profits subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5).

Coordination rules for simple cases.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which the conditions of § 1.245A-6(b)(1) and (2) are satisfied and for which the section 245A shareholder chooses to apply this section (in lieu of § 1.245A-8).
(b)
Reduction of disqualified basis by reason of an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount
—(1)
In general.
If, for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder gives rise to one or more extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts, then, with respect
to an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account, the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), reduced (but not below zero) by an amount (determined in the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained) equal to the product of—
(i) The sum of the extraordinary disposition amounts and the tiered extraordinary disposition amounts; and
(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the disqualified basis of the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the disqualified basis of each item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account.
(2)
Timing rules regarding disqualified basis.
See § 1.245A-9(b)(2) for timing rules regarding the determination of, and reduction to, disqualified basis of an item of specified property.
(3)
Special rule regarding prior extraordinary disposition amounts.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is reduced under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A) by reason of a prior extraordinary disposition amount described in § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(D)(
1
)(
i
) through (
iv
), the extraordinary disposition account is considered to give rise to an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount (and the amount by which the account is reduced is treated as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount).
(c)
Reduction of extraordinary disposition account by reason of the allocation and apportionment of deductions or losses attributable to disqualified basis
—(1)
In general.
If, for a taxable year of a CFC, the CFC holds one or more items of specified property that correspond to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC, then the extraordinary disposition account is reduced (but not below zero) by the lesser of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section (each determined in the functional currency of the CFC).
(i) The excess (if any) of the adjusted earnings of the CFC for the taxable year of the CFC, over the sum of the previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to the CFC for purposes of section 959 (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year).
(ii) The balance of the section 245A shareholder's RGI account with respect to the CFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for the taxable year).
(2)
Timing of reduction to extraordinary disposition account.
See § 1.245A-9(b)(3) for timing rules regarding the reduction to an extraordinary disposition account.
(3)
Adjusted earnings.
The term
adjusted earnings
means, with respect to a CFC and a taxable year of the CFC, the earnings and profits of the CFC, determined as of the end of the CFC's taxable year (taking into account all distributions during the taxable year), and with the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) The earnings and profits are increased by the amount of any deduction or loss that is or was allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of the CFC solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i).
(ii) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount by which an RGI account with respect to the CFC has been decreased pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for a prior taxable year of the CFC.
(iii) The earnings and profits are determined without regard to income described in section 245(a)(5)(A) or dividends described in section 245(a)(5)(B) (determined without regard to section 245(a)(12)).
(4)
RGI account.
For a taxable year of a CFC, the following rules apply to determine the balance of a section 245A shareholder's RGI account with respect to the CFC:
(i) The balance of the RGI account is increased by the sum of the amounts of deductions and losses of the CFC that, but for § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i), would have
decreased one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income or the CFC's tested income, or increased or given rise to a tested loss or one or more qualified deficits of the CFC.
(ii) The balance of the RGI account is decreased to the extent that, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the taxable year of the CFC, there is a reduction to the extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder.
[T.D. 9934, 85 FR 76963, Dec. 1, 2020]
§ 1.245A-8
Coordination rules for complex cases.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies beginning with the first day of the first taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which § 1.245A-7 does not apply and for all taxable years thereafter, or for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which the section 245A shareholder chooses not to apply § 1.245A-7.
(b)
Reduction of disqualified basis by reason of an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount
—(1)
In general.
If, for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder gives rise to one or more extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts, then, with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is reduced (but not below zero) by an amount (determined in the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained) equal to the product of—
(i) The excess (if any) of—
(A) The sum of the extraordinary disposition amounts and the tiered extraordinary disposition amounts; over
(B) The basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, and without regard to the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year); and
(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the disqualified basis of the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the disqualified basis of each item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder.
(2)
Timing rules regarding disqualified basis.
See § 1.245A-9(b)(2) for timing rules regarding the determination of, and reduction to, disqualified basis of an item of specified property.
(3)
Ownership requirement with respect to an item of specified property
—(i)
In general.
For a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, the ownership requirement of this paragraph (b)(3)(i) is satisfied with respect to an item of specified property if, on at least one day that falls within the taxable year, the item of specified property is held by—
(A) The section 245A shareholder;
(B) A person (other than the section 245A shareholder) that, on at least one day that falls within the section 245A shareholder's taxable year, is a related party with respect to the section 245A shareholder (such a person, a
qualified related party
with respect to the section 245A shareholder for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder); or
(C) A specified entity at least 10 percent of the interests of which are, on at least one day that falls within the section 245A shareholder's taxable year, owned directly or indirectly through one or more other specified entities by the section 245A shareholder or a qualified related party.
(ii)
Rules for determining an interest in a specified entity.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the phrase
at least 10 percent of the interests
means—
(A) If the specified entity is a foreign corporation, at least 10 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the foreign corporation;
(B) If the specified entity is a partnership, at least 10 percent of the interests in the capital or profits of the partnership; or
(C) If the specified entity is not a foreign corporation or a partnership, at least 10 percent of the value of the interests in the specified entity.
(4)
Basis benefit account
—(i)
General rules.
The term
basis benefit account
means, with respect to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder, an account of the section 245A shareholder (the initial balance of which is zero), adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section on the last day of each taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. The basis benefit account must be maintained in the same functional currency as the extraordinary disposition account.
(A) The balance of the basis benefit account is increased to the extent that a basis benefit amount with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is assigned to the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. However, if the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is less than 100 percent, then, the basis benefit account is instead increased by the amount equal to the basis benefit amount multiplied by the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage.
(B) The balance of the basis benefit account is decreased to the extent that, for a taxable year that includes the date on which the section 245A shareholder's taxable year ends, disqualified basis of an item of specified property would have been reduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section but for an amount in the basis benefit account.
(ii)
Rules for determining a basis benefit amount
—(A)
In general.
The term
basis benefit amount
means, with respect to an item of specified property that has disqualified basis, the portion of disqualified basis that, for a taxable year, is directly (or indirectly through one or more specified entities that are not corporations) taken into account for U.S. tax purposes by a U.S. tax resident, a CFC described in § 1.267A-5(a)(17), or a specified foreign person and—
(
1
) Reduces the amount of the U.S. tax resident's taxable income, one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income, the CFC's tested income, or the specified foreign person's ECTI, as applicable; or
(
2
) Prevents a decrease or offset of the amount of the CFC's tested loss or qualified deficits.
(B)
Rules for determining whether disqualified basis of an item of specified property is taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, disqualified basis of an item of specified property is taken into account for U.S. tax purposes without regard to whether the disqualified basis is reduced or eliminated under § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
).
(C)
Timing rules when disqualified basis gives rise to a deferred or disallowed loss.
To the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is deferred, then the determination of whether the item of deduction or loss gives rise to a basis benefit amount under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is made when the item of deduction or loss is no longer deferred. In addition, to the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is disallowed under section 267(a)(1), then a basis benefit amount is treated as occurring in the taxable year when and to the extent that gain is reduced pursuant to section 267(d), and provided that the gain is described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii)
Rules for assigning a basis benefit amount to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section with respect to a section 245A shareholder, a basis benefit amount with respect to an item of specified property is assigned to a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder if—
(
1
) With respect to the item of specified property, the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder; and
(
2
) The basis benefit amount occurs during the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, or a taxable year of a
U.S. tax resident (other than the section 245A shareholder), a CFC described in § 1.267A-5(a)(17), or a specified foreign person, as applicable, that—
(
i
) Ends with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder; or
(
ii
) Begins with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, but only in a case in which but for this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A)(
2
)(
ii
) the basis benefit amount would not be assigned to a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder.
(B)
Anti-duplication rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter such disqualified basis gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder. Thus, for example, if the entire amount of disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount for a particular taxable year of a CFC and is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder but, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
), the disqualified basis is not reduced or eliminated in such taxable year of the CFC (because, for example, the buyer is a CFC that is a related party) and, as a result, the disqualified basis thereafter gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, then no portion of the additional basis benefit amount is assigned to a taxable year of any section 245A shareholder.
(iv)
Successor rules for basis benefit accounts.
To the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4), a basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account is adjusted in a similar manner.
(5)
Special rules regarding duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property
—(i)
Adjustments to certain rules in applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, the following rules apply with respect to duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property:
(A) Duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property with respect to an item of specified property to which the item of exchanged property relates is not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Thus, for example, if for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section is satisfied with respect to an item of specified property and an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the item of specified property, all of the disqualified basis of which is duplicate DQB with respect to the item of specified property, then only the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of, and is subject to reduction under, paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(B) If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property with respect to an item of specified property is not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), the duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property is reduced (in the same manner as it would be if the disqualified basis were taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) by the product of the amounts described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section.
(
1
) The reduction, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, to the disqualified basis of the item of specified property to which the item of exchanged basis property relates.
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property with respect to the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the amounts of duplicate DQB with respect to the item of specified property of each item of exchanged basis property that relates to the item of specified property and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. For purposes of determining this fraction, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is determined pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (by replacing the term “paragraph (b)(1)” in that paragraph with the term “paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)”). In addition, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is excluded from the denominator of the fraction to the extent the duplicate DQB is attributable to duplicate DQB of another item of exchanged basis property that is included in the denominator of the fraction.
(ii)
Adjustments to certain rules in applying paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter duplicate DQB attributable to such disqualified basis of the item of specified property gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that duplicate DQB attributable to disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter such disqualified basis of the item of specified property (or duplicate DQB attributable to such disqualified basis of the item of specified property) gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder.
(6)
Special rule regarding prior extraordinary disposition amounts.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is reduced under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A) by reason of a prior extraordinary disposition amount described in § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(D)(
1
)(
i
) through (
iv
), the extraordinary disposition account is considered to give rise to an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount (and the amount by which the account is reduced is treated as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount).
(c)
Reduction of extraordinary disposition account by reason of the allocation and apportionment of deductions or losses attributable to disqualified basis
—(1)
In general.
For a taxable year of a CFC, if there is an RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC, and the section 245A shareholder satisfies the ownership requirement of paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the taxable year of the CFC, then, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (c)(6) and (7) of this section, the extraordinary disposition account is reduced (but not below zero) by the lesser of the following amounts (each determined in the functional currency of the CFC)—
(i) The excess (if any) of—
(A) The product of—
(
1
) The adjusted earnings of the CFC for the taxable year of the CFC; and
(
2
) The percentage of stock of the CFC (by value) that, in aggregate, is owned directly or indirectly through one or more specified entities by the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates on the last day of the taxable year of the CFC; over
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) The sum of the balance of the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to the CFC for purposes of section 959 (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year);
(
2
) The sum of the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts (as described in § 1.245A(e)-1(d)(1)) with respect to shares of stock of the CFC that the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates own (within the meaning of section 958(a), and determined by treating a domestic partnership as foreign) as of the end of the taxable year of the
CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year; and
(
3
) The sum of the balance of the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' extraordinary disposition accounts with respect to the CFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year). However, if the section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate has an RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC, then only the excess, if any, of the balance of the extraordinary disposition account over the balance of the RGI account that relates to the extraordinary disposition account (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year) is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(
3
). In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(
3
), an extraordinary disposition account that but for paragraph (e)(1) of this section would be with respect to the CFC for purposes of this section is treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC and thus is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(
3
).
(ii) The balance of the RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year).
(2)
Timing of reduction to extraordinary disposition account.
See § 1.245A-9(b)(3) for timing rules regarding the reduction to an extraordinary disposition account.
(3)
Adjusted earnings.
The term
adjusted earnings
means, with respect to a CFC and a taxable year of the CFC, the earnings and profits of the CFC, determined as of the end of the CFC's taxable year (taking into account all distributions during the taxable year, and not taking into account any deficit in earnings and profits subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5)) and with the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) The earnings and profits are increased by the amount of any deduction or loss that—
(A) Is or was attributable to disqualified basis of an item of specified property, but only to the extent that gain recognized on the extraordinary disposition of the item of specified property was included in the initial balance of an extraordinary disposition account;
(B) Is or was allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of the CFC (or a predecessor) solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i); and
(C) Does not or has not given rise to or increased a deficit in earnings and profits subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5), determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC.
(ii) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount by which any RGI account with respect to the CFC has been decreased pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for a prior taxable year of the CFC.
(iii) The earnings and profits are determined without regard to earnings attributable to income described in section 245(a)(5)(A) or dividends described in section 245(a)(5)(B) (determined without regard to section 245(a)(12)).
(iv) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount of any deduction or loss that, but for paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, would be described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
RGI account
—(i)
In general.
For a taxable year of a CFC, the following rules apply to determine the balance of a section 245A shareholder's RGI account that is with respect to the CFC and that relates to an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC:
(A) The balance of the RGI account is increased by the product of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) and (2) of this section for a taxable year of the CFC.
(
1
) The sum of the amounts of deductions and losses of the CFC that—
(
i
) Are attributable to disqualified basis of one or more items of specified
property that correspond to the extraordinary disposition account; and
(
ii
) But for § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i), would have decreased one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income, the CFC's tested income, or the CFC's ECTI, or increased or given rise to a tested loss or one or more qualified deficits of the CFC.
(
2
) The lesser of—
(
i
) A fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the sum of the portions of the CFC's subpart F income and tested income or tested loss (expressed as a positive number) taken into account under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a) (as determined under the rules of §§ 1.951-1(b) and (e) and 1.951A-1(d)) by the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates of the section 245A shareholder and the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' pro rata shares of the CFC's qualified deficits (expressed as a positive number), and the denominator of which is the sum of the CFC's subpart F income, tested income or tested loss (expressed as a positive number), and qualified deficits (expressed as a positive number), but for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A)(
2
)(
i
) treating ECTI (expressed as a positive number) as if it were subpart F income; and
(
ii
) The extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable as to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account.
(B) The balance of the RGI account is decreased to the extent that, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the taxable year of the CFC, there is a reduction to the extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder.
(ii)
Successor rules for RGI accounts.
To the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4), an RGI account of a CFC with respect to the extraordinary disposition account is adjusted in a similar manner.
(5)
Ownership requirement with respect to a CFC.
For a taxable year of a CFC, a section 245A shareholder satisfies the ownership requirement of this paragraph (c)(5) if, on the last day of the CFC's taxable year, the section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate is a United States shareholder with respect to the CFC.
(6)
Allocation of reductions among multiple extraordinary disposition accounts.
This paragraph (c)(6) applies if, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to a taxable year of a CFC (and but for the application of this paragraph (c)(6) and paragraph (c)(7) of this section), the sum of the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to two or more extraordinary disposition accounts of a section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate of the section 245A shareholder would exceed the amount described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section (the amount of such excess, the
excess amount
). When this paragraph (c)(6) applies, the reduction to each extraordinary disposition account described in the previous sentence is equal to the reduction that would occur but for this paragraph (c)(6) and paragraph (c)(7) of this section, less the product of the excess amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of the extraordinary disposition account, and the denominator of which is the sum of the balances of all of the extraordinary dispositions accounts described in the previous sentence. For purposes of determining this fraction, the balance of an extraordinary disposition account is determined as of the end of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder or the domestic affiliate, as applicable, that includes the date on which the CFC's taxable year ends (and after the determination of any extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder or the domestic affiliate, as applicable, and adjustments to the extraordinary disposition account for prior extraordinary disposition amounts).
(7)
Extraordinary disposition account not reduced below balance of basis benefit account.
An extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder cannot be reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section below the balance of the basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account (determined when a
reduction to the extraordinary disposition account would occur under paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(d)
Special rules for determining when specified property corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account
—(1)
Substituted property
—(i)
Treatment as specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account.
For purposes of this section, an item of substituted property is treated as an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account to which the related item of specified property (that is, the item of specified property to which the item of substituted property relates, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) corresponds. In addition, in a case in which an item of substituted property relates to an item of specified property that corresponds to a particular extraordinary disposition account and an item of specified property that corresponds to another extraordinary disposition account (such that, pursuant to this paragraph (d)(1)(i), the item of substituted property is treated as corresponding to multiple extraordinary disposition accounts), only the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property attributable to the first item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of applying this section as to the first extraordinary disposition account, and, similarly, only the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property attributable to the second item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of applying this section as to the second extraordinary disposition account.
(ii)
Definition of substituted property.
The term
substituted property
means an item of property the disqualified basis of which is, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) or (
iii
), increased by reason of a reduction under § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(
B
)(
1
) in disqualified basis of an item of specified property. An item of substituted property relates to an item of specified property if the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property was increased by reason of a reduction in disqualified basis of the item of specified property.
(2)
Exchanged basis property
—(i)
Treatment as specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account for certain purposes.
For purposes of this section, an item of exchanged basis property is treated as an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account to which the related item of specified property (that is, the item of specified property to which the item of exchanged basis property relates) corresponds.
(ii)
Definition of exchanged basis property.
The term
exchanged basis property
means an item of property the disqualified basis of which, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
), includes disqualified basis of an item of specified property. An item of exchanged basis property relates to an item of specified property if the disqualified basis of the item of exchanged basis property includes disqualified basis of the item of specified property.
(iii)
Definition of duplicate DQB
—(A)
In general.
The term
duplicate DQB
means, with respect to an item of exchanged basis property and the item of specified property to which the exchanged basis property relates, the disqualified basis of the item of exchanged basis property that includes or is attributable to disqualified basis of the item of specified property.
(B)
Certain nonrecognition transfers involving stock or a partnership interest.
To the extent that an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership (
lower-tier item
) includes disqualified basis of an item of specified property to which the lower-tier item relates (
contributed item
), and another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or a partnership interest (
upper-tier item
) includes disqualified basis of the lower-tier item that is attributable to disqualified basis of the contributed item, the disqualified basis of the upper-tier item is attributable to disqualified basis of the contributed item and the upper-tier item is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the contributed item. The principles of the preceding sentence apply each time disqualified basis of an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership is included in
disqualified basis of another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership.
(C)
Multiple nonrecognition transfers of an item of specified property.
To the extent that multiple items of exchanged basis property that are stock or interests in a partnership include disqualified basis of the same item of specified property (
contributed item
) to which the items of exchanged basis property relate, and the issuer of one of the items of exchanged basis property (
upper-tier successor item
) receives the other item of exchanged basis property (
lower-tier successor item
) in exchange for the contributed property, the disqualified basis of the upper-tier successor item is attributable to disqualified basis of the lower-tier successor item and the upper-tier successor item is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the lower-tier successor item. The principles of the preceding sentence apply each time disqualified basis of an item of specified property to which an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in partnership relates is included in disqualified basis of another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership.
(e)
Special rules when extraordinary disposition accounts are adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4)
—(1)
Extraordinary disposition account with respect to multiple SFCs.
This paragraph (e)(1) applies if, pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4)(ii) or (iii) (the transaction or transactions by reason of which § 1.245A-5(c)(4)(ii) or (iii) applies, the
adjustment transaction
), an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC (such extraordinary disposition account, the
transferor ED account;
and such SFC, the
transferor SFC
) gives rise to an increase in the balance of an extraordinary disposition account with respect to another SFC (such extraordinary disposition account, the
transferee ED account;
such SFC, the
transferee SFC;
and such increase, the
adjustment amount
). When this paragraph (e)(1) applies, the following rules apply for purposes of this section:
(i) A ratable portion of the transferee ED account is treated as retaining its status as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferor SFC and is not treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferee SFC (the transferee ED account to such extent, the
deemed transferor ED account
), based on the adjustment amount relative to the balance of the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) immediately after the adjustment transaction. Thus, for example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction, the items of specified property that correspond to the deemed transferor ED account are the same as the items of specified property that correspond to the transferor ED account. As an additional example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the deemed transferor ED account is the same as the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the transferor ED account (except to the extent the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage is adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section).
(ii) In the case of an amount (such as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount) determined by reference to the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)), the portion of the amount that is considered attributable to the deemed transferor ED account (and not the transferee ED account) is equal to the product of such amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of the deemed transferor ED account, and the denominator of which is the balance of the transferee ED account (determined without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)). Thus, for example, if after an adjustment transaction the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) gives rise to an extraordinary disposition amount, and if the fraction (expressed as a percentage) is 40, then, for purposes of this section, 40 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is treated as attributable to the deemed transferor ED account
and the remaining 60 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is attributable to the transferee ED account, and the balance of each of the deemed transferor ED account and the transferee ED account is correspondingly reduced.
(2)
Extraordinary disposition accounts with respect to a single SFC.
If an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC is reduced by reason of § 1.245A-5(c)(4), then, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for purposes of this section, the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage as to the extraordinary disposition account (as well as the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage as to any extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC that is increased by reason of the reduction) is adjusted in a similar manner.

(b)
Rules of general applicability
—(1)
Correspondence.
An item of specified property corresponds to a section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account if gain was recognized on the extraordinary disposition of the item and the gain was taken into account in determining the initial balance of the account. See § 1.245A-8(d) for additional rules regarding when an item of property is treated as corresponding to an extraordinary disposition account in certain complex cases.
(2)
Timing rules related to disqualified basis for purposes of applying §§ 1.245A-7(b) and 1.245A-8(b)
—(i)
Determination of disqualified basis.
For purposes of determining the fraction described in § 1.245A-7(b)(1)(ii) or § 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii) when applying § 1.245A-7(b)(1) or § 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii), respectively, for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, disqualified basis of an item of specified property is determined as of the beginning of the taxable year of the CFC that holds the item of specified property (in a case in which § 1.245A-7(b) applies) or the specified property owner (in a case in which § 1.245A-8(b) applies), in either case, that includes the date on which the section 245A shareholder's taxable year ends (and without regard to any reductions to the disqualified basis of the item of specified property pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1) or § 1.245A-8(b)(1) for such taxable year of the CFC or the specified property owner, as applicable). However, if disqualified basis of the item of specified property arose as a result of an extraordinary disposition that occurred after the beginning of the taxable year of the CFC or the specified property owner described in the preceding sentence, then the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is determined as of the date on which the extraordinary disposition occurred (and without regard to any reductions to the disqualified basis of the item of specified property pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for such taxable year of the CFC or the specified property owner).
(ii)
Reduction to disqualified basis of an item of specified property.
The reduction to disqualified basis of an item of specified property pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1) or § 1.245A-8(b)(1) occurs on the date described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Definition of specified property owner.
For purposes of applying § 1.245A-8(b)(1) and paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, the term
specified property owner
means, with respect to an item of specified property, the person that, on at least one day of the taxable year of the person that includes the date on which the section 245A shareholder's taxable year ends, held the item of specified property. However, if, but for this sentence, there would be more than one specified property owner with respect to the item of specified property, then the specified property owner is the person that held the item of specified property on the earliest date that falls within the section 245A shareholder's taxable year.
(3)
Timing rules for reducing an extraordinary disposition account under §§ 1.245A-7(c) and 1.245A-8(c).
For purposes of § 1.245A-7(c)(1) or § 1.245A-
8(c)(1), as applicable, with respect to a taxable year of a CFC, the reduction to an extraordinary disposition account pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c)(1) or § 1.245A-8(c)(1) occurs as of the end of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder that includes the date on which the CFC's taxable year ends (and after the determination of any extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary amounts, adjustments to the extraordinary disposition account for prior extraordinary disposition amounts, and the application of § 1.245A-7(b) or § 1.245A-8(b), as applicable, each for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder).
(4)
Currency translation.
For purposes of applying §§ 1.245A-7(b) and 1.245A-8(b), the disqualified basis of (and, if applicable, a basis benefit amount with respect to) an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account are translated (if necessary) into the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained, using the spot rate on the date the extraordinary disposition occurred. A reduction in disqualified basis of an item of specified property determined under § 1.245A-7(b)(1) or § 1.245A-8(b)(1) is translated (if necessary) into the functional currency in which the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is maintained, and a reduction in an extraordinary disposition account determined under § 1.245A-7(c) or § 1.245A-8(c) section is translated (if necessary) into the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained, in each case using the spot rate described in the preceding sentence.
(5)
Anti-avoidance rule.
Appropriate adjustments are made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(5), including adjustments that would disregard a transaction or arrangement in whole or in part, to any amounts determined under (or subject to application of) this section if a transaction or arrangement is engaged in with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of §§ 1.245A-6 through 1.245A-10.

§ 1.245A-10
Examples.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides examples illustrating the application of §§ 1.245A-6 through 1.245A-9.
(b)
Presumed facts.
For purposes of the examples in the section, except as otherwise stated, the following facts are presumed:
(1) US1 and US2 are both domestic corporations that have calendar taxable years.
(2) CFC1, CFC2, CFC3, and CFC4 are all SFCs and CFCs that have taxable years ending November 30.
(3) Each entity uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
(4) There are no items of deduction or loss attributable to an item of specified property.
(5) Absent the application of § 1.245A-5, any dividends received by US1 from CFC1 would meet the requirements to qualify for the section 245A deduction.
(6) All dispositions of items of specified property by an SFC during a disqualified period of the SFC to a related party give rise to an extraordinary disposition.
(7) None of the CFCs have a deficit subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5), and none of the CFCs are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and therefore none of the CFCs have ECTI).
(8) There is no previously taxed earnings and profits account with respect to any CFC for purposes of section 959. In addition, each hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of a CFC has a zero balance at all times. Further, there is no extraordinary disposition account with respect to any CFC.
(9) Under § 1.245A-11(b), taxpayers choose to apply §§ 1.245A-6 through 1.245A-11 to the relevant taxable years.
(c)
Examples
—(1)
Example 1. Reduction of disqualified basis under rule for simple cases by reason of dividend paid out of extraordinary disposition account
—(i)
Facts.
US1 owns 100% of the single class of stock of CFC1 and CFC2. On November 30, 2018, in a transaction that is an extraordinary disposition, CFC1 sells two items of specified property, Item 1 and Item 2, to CFC2 in exchange for $150x of cash (the “Disqualified Transfer”). Item 1 is sold for $90x and Item 2 is sold for $60x. Item 1 and Item 2 each has a basis of $0 in the hands of CFC1 immediately before the Disqualified Transfer, and therefore CFC1 recognizes $150x of gain as a result of the Disqualified Transfer ($150×−$0). After the Disqualified Transfer, CFC2's only assets are Item 1 and Item 2. On November 30, 2018, and thus during US1's taxable year ending December 31, 2018, CFC1 distributes $150x of cash to US1, and all of the distribution is characterized as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) and treated as a distribution out of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). For CFC1's taxable year ending on November 30, 2018, CFC1 has $160x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3), without regard to any distributions during the taxable year. CFC2 continues to hold Item 1 and Item 2. Lastly, because the conditions of § 1.245A-6(b)(1) and (2) are satisfied for US1's 2018 taxable year, US1 chooses to apply § 1.245A-7 (rules for simple cases) in lieu of § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) for that taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of §§ 1.245A-5 and 1.951A-2 as a result of the Disqualified Transfer.
As a result of the Disqualified Transfer, under § 1.951A-2(c)(5), Item 1 has disqualified basis of $90x, and Item 2 has disqualified basis of $60x. In addition, as a result of the Disqualified Transfer, under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A), US1 has an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 with an initial balance of $150x. Under § 1.245A-5(c)(2)(i), $10x of the dividend is considered paid out of non-extraordinary disposition E
P of CFC1 with respect to US1, and $140x of the dividend is considered paid out of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 to the extent of the balance of the extraordinary disposition account ($150x). Thus, the dividend of $150x is an extraordinary disposition amount, within the meaning of § 1.245A-5(c)(1), to the extent of $140x. As a result, the balance of the extraordinary disposition account is reduced to $10x ($150×−$140x).
(B)
Correspondence requirement.
Under § 1.245A-9(b)(1), each of Item 1 and Item 2 corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, because as a result of the Disqualified Transfer CFC1 recognized gain with respect to Item 1 and Item 2, and the gain was taken into account in determining the initial balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1.
(C)
Reduction of disqualified basis of Item 1.
Because Item 1 corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account, the disqualified basis of Item 1 is reduced pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1) by reason of US1's $140x extraordinary disposition amount for US1's 2018 taxable year. Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section describe the determinations pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1).
(
1
) To determine the reduction to the disqualified basis of Item 1, the disqualified basis of Item 1, as well as the disqualified basis of Item 2, must be determined as of the date described in § 1.245A-9(b)(2)(i) (and before the application of § 1.245A-7(b)(1)).
See
§ 1.245A-7(b)(1)(ii). For each of Item 1 and Item 2, that date is December 1, 2018. December 1, 2018, is the first day of the taxable year of CFC2 (the CFC that holds Item 1 and Item 2) beginning on December 1, 2018, which is the taxable year of CFC2 that includes December 31, 2018, the date on which US1's 2018 taxable year ends.
See
§ 1.245A-9(b)(2)(i).
(
2
) Pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1), the disqualified basis of Item 1 is reduced by $84x, computed as the product of—
(
i
) $140x, the extraordinary disposition amount; and
(
ii
) A fraction, the numerator of which is $90x (the disqualified basis of Item 1 on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-7(b)(1)), and the denominator of which is $150x (the disqualified basis of Item 1, $90x, plus the disqualified basis of Item 2, $60x, in each case determined on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-7(b)(1)).
See
§ 1.245A-7(b)(1).
(
3
) The $84x reduction to the disqualified basis of Item 1 occurs on December 1, 2018, the date on which the disqualified basis of Item 1 is determined for purposes of determining the reduction pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b)(1).
See
§ 1.245A-9(b)(2)(ii).
(D)
Reduction of disqualified basis of Item 2.
For reasons similar to those described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, on December 1, 2018, the disqualified basis of Item 2 is reduced by $56x, the amount equal to the product of $140x, the extraordinary disposition amount, and a fraction, the numerator of which is $60x (the disqualified basis of Item 2 on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-7(b)(1)), and the denominator of which is $150x (the disqualified basis of Item 1, $90x, plus the disqualified basis of Item 2, $60x, in each case determined on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-7(b)(1)).

—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) (and the results are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), except that, on December 1, 2018, CFC2
sells Item 1 for $90x of cash to an individual that is not a related party with respect to US1 or CFC2 (such transaction, the “Sale,” and such individual, “Individual A”). At the time of the Sale, CFC2's basis in Item 1 is $90x (all of which is disqualified basis, as described in § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(A)). CFC2 takes into the account the disqualified basis of Item 1 for purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized on the Sale, which is $0 ($90x−$90x); but for the disqualified basis, CFC2 would have had $90x of gain that would have been taken into account in computing its tested income. As a result of the Sale, the condition of § 1.245A-6(b)(2) is not satisfied, because on at least one day of CFC2's taxable year beginning on December 1, 2018 (which begins within US1's 2018 taxable year) CFC2 does not hold Item 1.
See
§ 1.245A-6(b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
). US1 therefore applies § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) for its 2018 taxable year.
See
§ 1.245A-6(b).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Ownership requirement.
With respect to each of Item 1 and Item 2, the ownership requirement of § 1.245A-8(b)(3)(i) is satisfied for US1's 2018 taxable year. This is because on at least one day that falls within US1's 2018 taxable year, each of Item 1 and Item 2 is held by CFC2, and US1 directly owns all of the stock of CFC2 throughout such taxable year (and thus, for purposes of applying § 1.245A-8(b)(3)(i), US1 owns at least 10% of the interests of CFC2 on at least one day that falls within such taxable year).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(3).
(B)
Basis benefit amount with respect to Item 1 as a result of the Sale.
Under § 1.245A-8(b)(4)(i), US1 has a basis benefit account with respect to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1. As described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section, the balance of the basis benefit account (which is initially zero) is, on December 31, 2018, increased by $90x, the basis benefit amount with respect to Item 1 and assigned to US1's 2018 taxable year.
(
1
) By reason of the Sale, for CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, and ending November 30, 2019, the entire $90x of disqualified basis of Item 1 is taken into account for U.S. tax purposes by CFC2 and, as a result, reduces CFC2's tested income or increases CFC2's tested loss. Accordingly, for such taxable year, there is a $90x basis benefit amount with respect to Item 1.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(ii)(A). The result would be the same if the Sale were to a related person and thus, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
), no portion of the $90x of disqualified basis were eliminated or reduced by reason of the Sale.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(ii)(B).
(
2
) The $90x basis benefit amount with respect to Item 1 is assigned to US1's 2018 taxable year. This is because the ownership requirement of § 1.245A-8(b)(3)(i) is satisfied with respect to Item 1 for US1's 2018 taxable year, and the basis benefit amount occurs in CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, a taxable year of CFC2 that begins within US1's 2018 taxable year (and, but for § 1.245A-8(b)(4)(iii)(A)(
2
)(
ii
), the basis benefit amount would not be assigned to a taxable year of US1, such as the taxable year of US1 beginning January 1, 2019, given that, as result of the Sale, the ownership requirement of § 1.245A-8(b)(3)(i) would not be satisfied with respect to Item 1 for such taxable year).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(iii)(A).
(
3
) On December 31, 2018 (the last day of US1's 2018 taxable year), US1's basis benefit account with respect to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is increased by $90x, the $90x basis benefit amount with respect to Item 1 and assigned to US1's 2018 taxable year. The basis benefit account is increased by such amount because Item 1 corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, and the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable to such extraordinary disposition account is 100.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(i)(A).
(C)
Basis benefit amount limitation on reduction to disqualified basis.
By reason of US1's $140x extraordinary disposition amount for US1's 2018 taxable year, the disqualified basis of Item 1 is reduced by $30x, and the disqualified basis of Item 2 is reduced by $20x, pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b). Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section describe the determinations pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1).
(
1
) For purposes of determining the reduction to the disqualified bases of Item 1 and Item 2, the disqualified bases of the Items are determined on December 1, 2018 (and before the application of § 1.245A-8(b)(1)).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii). The disqualified bases of the Items are determined on December 1, 2018, because that date is the first day of the taxable year of CFC2 beginning on December 1, 2018, which is the taxable year of CFC2 (the specified property owner of each of Item 1 and Item 2) that includes December 31, 2018, the date on which US1's 2018 taxable year ends.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(2)(i). For purposes of applying §§ 1.245A-8(b)(1) and § 1.245A-9(b)(2) for US1's 2018 taxable year, CFC2 is the specified property owner of each of Item 1 and Item 2 because, on at least one day of CFC2's taxable year that includes the date on which US1's 2018 taxable year ends (that is, on at least one day of CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018), CFC2 held the Item.
See
§ 1.245A-9(b)(2)(iii). CFC2 is the specified property owner of Item 1 even though Individual A also held Item 1 during Individual A's taxable year that includes the date on which US1's 2018 taxable year ends because CFC2 held Item 1 on an earlier date than Individual A.
See
§ 1.245A-9(b)(2)(iii).
(
2
) Pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1), the disqualified basis of Item 1 is reduced by $30x, computed as the product of—
(
i
) $50x, the excess of the extraordinary disposition amount ($140x) over the balance of the basis benefit account with respect to US1's extraordinary disposition with respect to CFC1 ($90x); and
(
ii
) A fraction, the numerator of which is $90x (the disqualified basis of Item 1 on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-8(b)(1)), and the denominator of which is $150x (the disqualified basis of Item 1, $90x, plus the disqualified basis of Item 2, $60x, in each case determined on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-8(b)(1)).
See
paragraph § 1.245A-8(b)(1).
(
3
) Pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1), the disqualified basis of Item 2 is reduced by $20x, computed as the product of—
(
i
) $50x, the excess of the extraordinary disposition amount ($140x) over the balance of the basis benefit account with respect to US1's extraordinary disposition with respect to CFC1 ($90x); and
(
ii
) A fraction, the numerator of which is $60x (the disqualified basis of Item 2 on December 1, 2018, and before the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section), and the denominator of which is $150x (the disqualified basis of Item 1, $90x, plus the disqualified basis of Item 2, $60x, in each case determined on December 1, 2018, and before the application of § 1.245A-8(b)(1)).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(1).
(
4
) The $30x and $20x reductions to the disqualified bases of Item 1 and Item 2, respectively, occur on December 1, 2018, the date on which the disqualified bases of the Items are determined for purposes of determining the reductions pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1).
See
§ 1.245A-9(b)(2)(ii).
(D)
Reduction of basis benefit account.
The balance of the basis benefit account with respect to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is decreased by $90x, the amount by which, for CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, the disqualified bases of Item 1 and Item 2 would have been reduced pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b)(1) but for the $90x balance of the basis benefit account.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(i)(B). The reduction to the balance of the basis benefit account occurs on December 31, 2018, and after the completion of all other computations pursuant to § 1.245A-8(b).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(4)(i)(B).

Example 3. Reduction in balance of extraordinary disposition account under rules for simple cases by reason of allocation and apportionment of deductions to residual CFC gross income
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) (and the results are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), except that CFC1 does not make a distribution to US1. In addition, during CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, and ending November 30, 2019, the disqualified basis of Item 1 gives rise to a $6x amortization deduction, and the disqualified basis of Item 2 gives rise to a $4x amortization deduction, and each of the amortization deductions is allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of CFC2 solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5) (though, but for § 1.951A-2(c)(5), would have been allocated and apportioned to gross tested income of CFC2). Further, as of the end of CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, CFC2 has $15x of earnings and profits. Lastly, because the conditions of § 1.245A-6(b)(1) and (2) are satisfied for US1's 2018 taxable year, US1 chooses to apply § 1.245A-7 (rules for simple cases) in lieu of § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) for that taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c)(1), US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is reduced by the lesser of the amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1, and the RGI account of US1 with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1.
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(1). Paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section describe the determinations pursuant to § 1.245A-8(c)(1).
(A)
Computation of adjusted earnings of CFC2, and amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1.
To determine the amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1, the adjusted earnings of CFC2 must be computed for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019.
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i). Paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section describe these determinations.
(
1
) The adjusted earnings of CFC2 for its taxable year ending November 30, 2019, is $25x, computed as $15x (CFC2's earnings and profits as of November 30, 2019, the last day of that taxable year), plus $10x (the sum of the $6x and $4x amortization deductions of CFC2 for that taxable year, which is the amount of all deductions or losses of CFC2 that is or was attributable to disqualified basis of items of specified property and allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of CFC2 solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i)).
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(3).
(
2
) For CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, the amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 is $25x, computed as the excess of $25x (the adjusted earnings) over $0 (the sum of the balance of the previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to CFC2).
(B)
Increase to balance of RGI account.
Under § 1.245A-9(d)(11), US1 has an RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1. On November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year), the balance of the RGI account (which is initially zero) is increased by $10x, the sum of the $6x and $4x amortization deductions of CFC2 for its taxable year ending November 30, 2019.
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(4)(i). Each of the amortization deductions is taken into account for this purpose because, but for § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i),
the deduction would have decreased CFC2's tested income or increased or given rise to a tested loss of CFC2.
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(4)(i).
(C)
Reduction in balance of extraordinary disposition account.
Pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c)(1), US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is reduced by $10x, the lesser of the amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019 ($25x), and the balance of US1's RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 ($10x, determined as of November 30, 2019, but without regard to the application of § 1.245A-7(c)(4)(ii) for the taxable year of CFC2 ending on that date).
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(1). The $10x reduction in the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account occurs on December 31, 2019, the last day of US1's taxable year that includes November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year).
See
§ 1.245A-9(c)(3).
(D)
Reduction in balance of RGI account.
On November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year), the balance of US1's RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is decreased by $10x, the amount of the reduction, pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c)(1) section and by reason of the RGI account, to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1.
See
§ 1.245A-7(c)(4)(ii). Therefore, following that reduction, the balance of the RGI account is zero ($10x−$10x).
(iii)
Alternative facts in which the reduction is limited by earnings and profits.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 3
), except that CFC2 has a $5x deficit in its earnings and profits as of the end of its taxable year ending November 30, 2019. In this case—
(A) The adjusted earnings of CFC2 for its taxable year ending November 30, 2019, is $5x, computed as −$5x (CFC2's deficit in earnings and profits as of November 30, 2019) plus $10x (the sum of the $6x and $4x amortization deductions of CFC2),
see
§ 1.245A-7(c)(3);
(B) The amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 for CFC's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, is $5x, computed as the excess of $5x (the adjusted earnings) over $0 (the sum of the balance of the previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to CFC2),
see
§ 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i);
(C) On December 31, 2019, US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is reduced by $5x, the lesser of the amount described in § 1.245A-7(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019 ($5x), and the balance of US1's RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 ($10x, determined as of November 30, 2019, but without regard to the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i)(B) for the taxable year of CFC2 ending on that date),
see
§§ 1.245A-7(c)(1) and 1.245A-9(c)(3); and
(D) On November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year), the balance of US1's RGI account with respect to CFC2 is decreased by $5x (the amount of the reduction, pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c)(1) and by reason of the RGI account, to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1) and, therefore, following such reduction, the balance of the RGI account is $5x ($10x−$5x),
see
§ 1.245A-7(c)(4)(ii).
(4)
Example 4. Reduction to extraordinary disposition accounts limited by § 1.245A-8(c)(6)
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section (
Example 3,
alternative facts in which the reduction is limited by earnings and profits) (and the results are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), except that US1 also owns 100% of the stock of US2, which owns 100% of the stock of CFC3, and on November 30, 2018, in a transaction that was an extraordinary disposition, CFC3 sold an item of specified property (“Item 3”) to CFC2 in exchange for $200x of cash. Item 3 had a basis of $0 in the hands of CFC3 immediately before the sale and, therefore, CFC3 recognized $200x of gain as a result of the sale ($200x−$0), Item 3 has $200x of disqualified basis under § 1.951A-2(c)(5), and US2 has an extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 with an initial balance of $200x under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A). Moreover, during CFC2's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, and ending November 30, 2019, the disqualified basis of Item 3 gives rise to a $20x amortization deduction, which is allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of CFC2 solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5) (though, but for § 1.951A-2(c)(5), would have been allocated and apportioned to gross tested income of CFC2). Further, as of the end of US1's 2018 taxable year, the balance of US1's basis benefit account with respect to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is $0; similarly, as of the end of US2's 2018 taxable year, the balance of US2's basis benefit account with respect to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2 is $0. Because CFC2 holds items of specified property that correspond to more than one extraordinary disposition account (that is, Item 1 and Item 2 correspond to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2, and Item 3 corresponds to US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2), the condition of § 1.245A-6(b)(2) is not satisfied.
See
§ 1.245A-6(b)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
). US1 and US2 therefore apply § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) for their 2018 taxable years.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to § 1.245A-8(c)(1), US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is, subject to the limitation in § 1.245A-8(c)(6), reduced by the lesser of the
amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1, and the RGI account of US1 with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1.
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1). Similarly, US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 is, subject to the limitation in § 1.245A-8(c)(6), reduced by the lesser of the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US2, and the RGI account of US2 with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3.
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1). Paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section describe the determinations pursuant to § 1.245A-8(c)(1).
(A)
Ownership requirement.
Each of US1 and US2 satisfy the ownership requirement of § 1.245A-8(c)(5) for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, because on the last day of that taxable year each is a United States shareholder with respect to CFC2.
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(5).
(B)
Computation of adjusted earnings of CFC2, and amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 and US2.
The adjusted earnings of CFC2 for its taxable year ending November 30, 2019, is $25x, computed as −$5x (CFC2's deficit in earnings and profits as of November 30, 2019), plus $30x (the sum of the $6x, $4x, and $20x amortization deductions of CFC2).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(3). For CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 is $25x, computed as the excess of the product of $25x (the adjusted earnings) and 100% (the percentage of the stock of CFC2 that US1 and its domestic affiliate, US2, own), over $0 (the sum of the balance of certain previously taxed earnings and profits accounts and hybrid deduction accounts).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i). Similarly, for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US2 is $25x, computed as the excess of the product of $25x (the adjusted earnings) and 100% (the percentage of the stock of CFC2 that US2 and its domestic affiliate, US1, own), over $0 (the sum of the balance of certain previously taxed earnings and profits accounts and hybrid deduction accounts).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i).
(C)
Increase to balance of RGI account.
As described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, US1 has an RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, and the balance of the RGI account is $10x on November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year). Similarly, US2 has an RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3, and the balance of the RGI account is $20x on November 30, 2019 (reflecting a $20x increase to the balance of the account for the $20x amortization deduction of CFC2 for its taxable year ending November 30, 2019).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i).
(D)
Reduction in balance of extraordinary disposition accounts but for § 1.245A-8(c)(6).
But for the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(6), US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC2 would be reduced by $10x, which is the lesser of $25x, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, and $10x, the balance of the RGI account of US1 with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 (determined as of November 30, 2019, but without regard to the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i)(B) for the taxable year of CFC2 ending on that date).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) and (ii). Similarly, but for the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(6), US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 would be reduced by $20x, which is the lesser of $25x, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US2 for CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019, and $20x, the balance of the RGI account of US2 with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 (determined as of November 30, 2019, but without regard to the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i)(B) for the taxable year of CFC2 ending on that date).
See
§ 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) and (ii).
(E)
Application of limitation of § 1.245A-8(c)(6).
As described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, but for the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(6), there would be a total of $30x of reductions to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, and US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3, by reason of the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(1) with respect to CFC2's taxable year ending November 30, 2019. Because that $30x exceeds the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i) with respect to US1 and US2 ($25x)—
(
1
) US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is reduced by $7.86x, computed as $10x (the reduction that would occur but for § 1.245A-8(c)(6)) less the product of $5x (the excess amount, computed as $30x, the total reductions that would occur but for the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(6), less $25x, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i)) and a fraction, the numerator of which is $150x (the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1) and the denominator of which is $350x ($150x, the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, plus $200x, the balance of US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3),
see
§ 1.245A-8(c)(6); and
(
2
) US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 is reduced by $17.14x, computed as $20x (the reduction that would occur but for § 1.245A-8(c)(6)) less the product of $5x (the excess amount, computed as $30x,
the total reductions that would occur but for the application of § 1.245A-8(c)(6), less $25x, the amount described in § 1.245A-8(c)(1)(i)) and a fraction, the numerator of which is $200x (the balance of US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3) and the denominator of which is $350x ($150x, the balance of US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, plus $200x, the balance of US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3),
see
§ 1.245A-8(c)(6) of this section.
(F)
Reduction in balance of RGI accounts.
On November 30, 2019 (the last day of CFC2's taxable year)—
(
1
) The balance of US1's RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 is decreased by $7.86x (the amount of the reduction, pursuant to § 1.245A-8(c)(1) and by reason of the RGI account, to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1) and, thus, following that reduction, the balance of the RGI account is $2.14x ($10x−$7.86x),
see
§ 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i)(B); and
(
2
) The balance of US2's RGI account with respect to CFC2 that relates to its extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3 is decreased by $17.14x (the amount of the reduction, pursuant to § 1.245A-8(c)(1) and by reason of the RGI account, to US2's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC3) and, thus, following that reduction, the balance of the RGI account is $2.86x ($20x−$17.14x),
see
§ 1.245A-8(c)(4)(i)(B).

Example 5. Computation of duplicate DQB
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) (and the results are the same as in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), except that CFC1 does not make any distribution to US1, and on November 30, 2018, immediately after the Disqualified Transfer, CFC2 transfers Item 1 to newly-formed CFC3 solely in exchange for the sole share of stock of CFC3 (the contribution, “Contribution 1,” and the share of stock of CFC3, the “CFC3 Share”) and, immediately after Contribution 1, CFC3 transfers Item 1 to newly-formed CFC4 solely in exchange for the sole share of stock of CFC4 (the contribution, “Contribution 2,” and the share of stock of CFC4, the “CFC4 Share”). Pursuant to section 358(a)(1), CFC2's basis in its share of stock of CFC3 is $90x, and CFC3's basis in its share of stock of CFC4 is $90x basis. As a result of Contribution 1, the condition of § 1.245A-6(b)(2) is not satisfied, because on at least one day of CFC2's taxable year ending on November 30, 2018 (which ends within US1's 2018 taxable year), CFC2 does not hold Item 1.
See
§ 1.245A-6(b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
). US1 therefore applies § 1.245A-8 (rules for complex cases) for its 2018 taxable year.
See
§ 1.245A-6(b).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of exchanged basis rule under section 951A to Contribution 1 and Contribution 2.
As a result of Contribution 1, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
), the disqualified basis of CFC3 Share includes the disqualified basis of Item 1 ($90x), and therefore the disqualified basis of CFC3 Share is $90x. Similarly, as a result of Contribution 2, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
), the disqualified basis of CFC4 Share also includes the disqualified basis of Item 1 ($90x), and therefore the disqualified basis of CFC4 Share is $90x.
(B)
Determination of duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share as a result of Contribution 1.
Because the disqualified basis of CFC3 Share includes the disqualified basis of Item 1, CFC3 Share is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to Item 1.
See
§ 1.245A-8(d)(2)(ii). In addition, because CFC3 Share is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to Item 1 (which corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1), CFC3 Share is, for purposes of § 1.245A-8, treated as an item of specified property that corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1.
See
§ 1.245A-8(d)(2)(i). Further, the duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share as to Item 1 is $90x, the portion of the disqualified basis of CFC3 Share that includes Item 1's disqualified basis of $90x.
See
§ 1.245A-8(d)(2)(iii)(A).
(C)
Determination of duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share as a result of Contribution 2.
For reasons similar to those described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, CFC4 Share is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to Item 1, CFC4 is treated for purposes of § 1.245A-8 as an item of specified property that corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1, and the duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share as to Item 1 is $90x.
(D)
Determination of duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share as a result of Contribution 2.
Because the disqualified basis of CFC3 Share and the disqualified basis of CFC4 Share each includes $90x of the disqualified basis of Item 1 and CFC3 receives the CFC4 Share in Contribution 2, the $90x of disqualified basis of CFC3 Share is attributable to the $90x of disqualified basis of CFC4 Share, and CFC3 Share is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to CFC4 Share.
See
§ 1.245A-8(d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(iii)(C). In addition, the duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share as to CFC4 Share is $90x.
See
§ 1.245A-8(d)(2)(iii)(A).
(E)
Application of duplicate basis rules in
§
1.245A-8(b)(5).
For purposes of computing the fraction described in § 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii), if US1's extraordinary disposition account with respect to CFC1 were to give rise to an extraordinary disposition amount or a tiered extraordinary disposition amount during US1's 2018 taxable year, then the duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share and the duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share would not be taken into account, because the disqualified basis of Item 1 (an item of specified property that corresponds to US1's extraordinary disposition account
and as to which each of CFC3 Share and CFC4 share relates) would be taken into account.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(5)(i)(A). Accordingly, in such a case, for US1's 2018 taxable year, the numerator of the fraction described in § 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii) would reflect only the disqualified basis of Item 1 or Item 2, as applicable, and the denominator would reflect only the sum of the disqualified basis of each of Item 1 and Item 2.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(5)(i)(A). Furthermore, to the extent there were to be a reduction under § 1.245A-8(b)(1) to the disqualified basis of Item 1, then the duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share would be reduced (but not below zero) by the product of the reduction to the disqualified basis of Item 1 and a fraction, the numerator of which would be $90x (the duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share), and the denominator of which would also be $90x (the duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share).
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(5)(i)(B). The $90x of duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share would be excluded from the denominator of the fraction described in the previous sentence because it is attributable to the $90x of duplicate DQB of CFC4 Share.
See
§ 1.245A-8(b)(5)(i)(B)(
2
) (last sentence). For reasons similar to those described in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(E) with respect to the application of § 1.245A-8(b)(5)(i)(B) to CFC4 Share, the duplicate DQB of CFC3 Share would be reduced (but not below zero) by the product of the reduction to the disqualified basis of Item 1 and a fraction, the numerator of which would be $90x, and the denominator of which would also be $90x.

§ 1.245A(d)-1
Disallowance of foreign tax credit or deduction.
(a)
No foreign tax credit or deduction allowed under section 245A(d)
-(1)
Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by domestic corporations or successors.
No credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year for:
(i) Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a domestic corporation that are attributable to section 245A(d) income of the domestic corporation;
(ii) Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a successor to a domestic corporation that are attributable to section 245A(d) income of the successor; and
(iii) Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation, other than a foreign corporation that is a passive foreign investment company (as defined in section 1297) with respect to the domestic corporation and that is not a controlled foreign corporation, that are attributable to non-inclusion income of the foreign corporation and are not otherwise disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2)
Foreign income taxes paid or accrued by foreign corporations.
No credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year for foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a foreign corporation that are attributable to section 245A(d) income, and such taxes are not eligible to be deemed paid under section 960 in any taxable year.
(3)
Effect of disallowance on earnings and profits.
The disallowance of a credit or deduction for foreign income taxes under this paragraph (a) does not affect whether the foreign income taxes reduce earnings and profits of a corporation.
(b)
Attribution of foreign income taxes
—(1)
Section 245A(d) income.
Foreign income taxes are attributable to section 245A(d) income to the extent that the foreign income taxes are allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 to the section 245A(d) income group. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), § 1.861-20 is applied by treating the section
245A(d) income group in each section 904 category of a domestic corporation, successor, or foreign corporation as a statutory grouping and treating all other income, including the receipt of a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits other than section 245A(d) PTEP, as income in the residual grouping. See § 1.861-20(d)(2) through (3) for rules regarding the allocation and apportionment of foreign income taxes to the statutory and residual groupings if the taxpayer does not realize, recognize, or take into account a corresponding U.S. item in the U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income taxes are paid or accrued. In the case of a foreign law distribution or foreign law disposition, a corresponding U.S. item is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings under § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) without regard to the application of section 246(c), the holding periods described in sections 964(e)(4)(A) and 1248(j), and § 1.245A-5.
(2)
Non-inclusion income of a foreign corporation
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (b)(2) provides rules for attributing foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation to non-inclusion income of the foreign corporation. It applies only in cases in which the foreign income taxes are allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of stock, whether the stock is held directly or indirectly through a partnership or other passthrough entity, for purposes of allocating and apportioning the domestic corporation's interest expense, or by reference to the income of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC.
(ii)
Foreign income taxes on a remittance, U.S. return of capital amount, or U.S. return of partnership basis amount.
This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) applies to foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation with respect to foreign taxable income that the domestic corporation includes by reason of a remittance, a distribution (including a foreign law distribution) that is a U.S. return of capital amount or U.S. return of partnership basis amount, or a disposition (including a foreign law disposition) that gives rise to a U.S. return of capital amount or a U.S. return of partnership basis amount. These foreign income taxes are attributable to non-inclusion income of the foreign corporation to the extent that they are allocated and apportioned to the domestic corporation's section 245A subgroup of general category stock, section 245A subgroup of passive category stock, or section 245A subgroup of U.S. source category stock in applying § 1.861-20 for purposes of section 904 as the operative section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), § 1.861-20 is applied by treating the domestic corporation's section 245A subgroup of general category stock, section 245A subgroup of passive category stock, and section 245A subgroup of U.S. source category stock as the statutory groupings and treating the tax book value of the non-section 245A subgroup of stock for each separate category as tax book value in the residual grouping.
(iii)
Foreign income taxes on income of a reverse hybrid or a foreign law CFC.
This paragraph (b)(2)(iii) applies to foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a domestic corporation, other than a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851), real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856), or S corporation (as defined in section 1361), that is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC with respect to the foreign law pass-through income or foreign law inclusion regime income of the reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC, respectively. These taxes are attributable to the non-inclusion income of a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC to the extent that they are allocated and apportioned to the non-inclusion income group under § 1.861-20. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), § 1.861-20 is applied by treating the non-inclusion income group in each section 904 category of the domestic corporation and the foreign corporation as a statutory grouping and treating all other income as income in the residual grouping.
(3)
Anti-avoidance rule.
Foreign income taxes are treated as attributable to section 245A(d) income of a domestic
corporation or foreign corporation, or non-inclusion income of a foreign corporation, if a transaction, series of related transactions, or arrangement is undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 245A(d) and this section with respect to such foreign income taxes, including, for example, by separating foreign income taxes from the income, or earnings and profits, to which such foreign income taxes relate or by making distributions (or causing inclusions) under foreign law in multiple years that give rise to foreign income taxes that are allocated and apportioned with reference to the same previously taxed earnings and profits. See paragraph (d)(4) of this section (

(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section.
(1)
Presumed facts.
Except as otherwise provided, the following facts are presumed for purposes of the examples:
(i) USP is a domestic corporation;
(ii) CFC is a controlled foreign corporation organized in Country A, and is not a reverse hybrid or a foreign law CFC;
(iii) USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC;
(iv) USP would be allowed a deduction under section 245A(a) for dividends received from CFC;
(v) All parties have a U.S. dollar functional currency and a U.S. taxable year and foreign taxable year that correspond to the calendar year; and
(vi) References to income are to gross items of income, and no party has deductions for Country A tax purposes or deductions for Federal income tax purposes (other than foreign income tax expense).
(2)
Example 1: Distribution for foreign and Federal income tax purposes—(i) Facts.
As of December 31, Year 1, CFC has $800x of section 951A PTEP (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(2)(viii)) in a single annual PTEP account (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(1)), and $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). On December 31, Year 1, CFC distributes $1,000x of cash to USP. For Country A
tax purposes, the entire $1,000x distribution is a dividend and is therefore a foreign dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). Country A imposes a withholding tax on USP of $150x with respect to the $1,000x of foreign gross dividend income under Country A law. For Federal income tax purposes, USP includes in gross income $200x of the distribution as a dividend for which a deduction is allowable under section 245A(a). The remaining $800x of the distribution is a distribution of PTEP that is excluded from USP's gross income and not treated as a dividend under section 959(a) and (d), respectively. The entire $1,000x dividend is a U.S. dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this section are applied by first determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the section 245A(d) income of USP, and then by determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is attributable under either paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii) of this section to the non-inclusion income of CFC. No credit or deduction is allowed in any taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for any portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP, or, under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for any portion of that tax that is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC, to the extent the tax is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to section 245A(d) income.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP to the extent that it is allocated and apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group (the statutory grouping) under § 1.861-20. Section 1.861-20(c) allocates and apportions foreign income tax to the statutory and residual groupings to which the items of foreign gross income that were included in the foreign tax base are assigned under § 1.861-20(d). Section 1.861-20(d)(3)(i) assigns foreign gross income that is a foreign dividend amount, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount, to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. dividend amount is assigned. The $1,000x foreign dividend amount is therefore assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the $1,000x U.S. dividend amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. The $1,000x U.S. dividend amount comprises a $200x dividend for which a deduction under section 245A(a) is allowed, which is an item of section 245A(d) income, and $800x of section 951A PTEP, the receipt of which is income in the residual grouping. Accordingly, $200x of the $1,000x of foreign gross dividend income is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group, and $800x is assigned to the residual grouping. Under § 1.861-20(f), $30x ($150x × $200x/$1,000x) of the $150x Country A withholding tax is apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group and is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP. The remaining $120x ($150x × $800x/$1,000x) of the tax is apportioned to the residual grouping.
(C)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax may be attributed to non-inclusion income of CFC if the tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to either the characterization of the tax book value of stock under § 1.861-9 or the income of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC. CFC is neither a reverse hybrid nor a foreign law CFC. In addition, no portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of CFC's stock. See § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i). Therefore, none of the tax is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
(D)
Disallowance.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for the $30x portion of the Country A withholding tax that is attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.

Example 2: Distribution for foreign law purposes
—(i)
Facts.
As of December 31, Year 1, CFC has $800x of section
951A PTEP (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(2)(viii)) in a single annual PTEP account (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(1)), and $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). On December 31, Year 1, CFC distributes $1,000x of its stock to USP. For Country A tax purposes, the entire $1,000x stock distribution is treated as a dividend to USP and is therefore a foreign dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). Country A imposes a withholding tax on USP of $150x with respect to the $1,000x of foreign gross dividend income that USP includes under Country A law. For Federal income tax purposes, USP does not recognize gross income as a result of the stock distribution under section 305(a). The $1,000x stock distribution is therefore a foreign law distribution.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this section are applied by first determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the section 245A(d) income of USP, and then by determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is attributable under either paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii) of this section to the non-inclusion income of CFC. No credit or deduction is allowed in any taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for any portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP or, under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for any portion of that tax that is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC, to the extent the tax is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to section 245A(d) income.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP to the extent that it is allocated and apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group (the statutory grouping) under § 1.861-20. Section 1.861-20(c) allocates and apportions foreign income tax to the statutory and residual groupings to which the items of foreign gross income that were included in the foreign tax base are assigned under § 1.861-20(d). In general, § 1.861-20(d) assigns foreign gross income to the statutory and residual groupings to which the corresponding U.S. item is assigned. If a taxpayer does not recognize a corresponding U.S. item in the year in which it pays or accrues foreign income tax with respect to foreign gross income that it includes by reason of a foreign law dividend, § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B) assigns the foreign dividend amount to the same statutory or residual groupings to which the foreign dividend amount would be assigned if a distribution were made for Federal income tax purposes in the amount of, and on the date of, the foreign law distribution. Further, § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B) computes the U.S. dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)) as if the distribution occurred on the date the distribution occurs for foreign law purposes. Therefore, the foreign dividend amount is assigned to the same statutory and residual groupings to which it would be assigned if a $1,000x distribution occurred on December 31, Year 1 for Federal income tax purposes. If such a distribution occurred, it would result in a $200x dividend to USP for which a deduction would be allowed under section 245A(a). The remaining $800x of the distribution would be excluded from USP's gross income and not treated as a dividend under section 959(a) and (d), respectively. Under paragraphs (c)(20) and (b)(1) of this section, the $1,000x U.S. dividend amount comprises a $200x dividend for which a deduction under section 245A(a) would be allowed, which is an item of section 245A(d) income, and $800x of section 951A PTEP, which is income in the residual grouping. Accordingly, $200x of the $1,000x foreign gross dividend income is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group, and $800x is assigned to the residual grouping. Under § 1.861-20(f), $30x ($150x × $200x/$1,000x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group and is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP. The remaining $120x ($150x × $800x/$1,000x) of the tax is apportioned to the residual grouping.
(C)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150x
Country A withholding tax may be attributed to non-inclusion income of CFC if the tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to either the characterization of the tax book value of stock under § 1.861-9 or the income of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC. CFC is neither a reverse hybrid nor a foreign law CFC. In addition, no portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of CFC's stock. See § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i). Therefore, none of the tax is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
(D)
Disallowance.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for the $30x portion of the Country A withholding tax that is attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.

Example 3: Successive foreign law distributions subject to anti-avoidance rule
—(i)
Facts.
For Year 1, CFC earns $500x of subpart F income that gives rise to a $500x gross income inclusion to USP under section 951(a), and income that creates $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). CFC earns no income in Years 2 through 4. As of January 1, Year 2, and through December 31, Year 4, CFC has $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) and $500x of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(2)(x)) in a single annual PTEP account (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(1)). In each of Years 2 and 3, USP makes a consent dividend election under Country A law that, for Country A tax purposes, deems CFC to distribute to USP, and USP immediately to contribute to CFC, $500x on December 31 of each year. For Country A tax purposes, each deemed distribution is a dividend of $500x to USP, and each deemed contribution is a non-taxable contribution of $500x to the capital of CFC. Each $500x deemed distribution is therefore a foreign dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). Country A imposes $150x of withholding tax on USP in each of Years 2 and 3 with respect to the $500x of foreign gross dividend income that USP includes in income under Country A law. For Federal income tax purposes, the Country A deemed distributions in Years 2 and 3 are disregarded such that USP recognizes no income, and the deemed distributions are therefore foreign law distributions. On December 31, Year 4, CFC distributes $1,000x to USP, which for Country A tax purposes is treated as a return of contributed capital on which no withholding tax is imposed. For Federal income tax purposes, $500x of the $1,000x distribution is a dividend to USP for which a deduction under section 245A(a) is allowed; the remaining $500x of the distribution is a distribution of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP that is excluded from USP's gross income and not treated as a dividend under section 959(a) and (d), respectively. The entire $1,000x dividend is a U.S. dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). The Country A consent dividend elections in Years 2 and 3 are made with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 245A(d) and this section to disallow a credit or deduction for Country A withholding tax incurred with respect to USP's section 245A(d) income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this section are applied by first determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 that is attributable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the section 245A(d) income of USP, and then by determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is attributable under either paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii) of this section to the non-inclusion income of CFC. Finally, the anti-avoidance rule under paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies to treat any portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 as attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP or non-inclusion income of CFC, if a transaction, series of related transactions, or arrangement is undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 245A(d) and this section. No credit or deduction is allowed in any taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for any portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax
paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 that is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP or, under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for any portion of that tax that is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC, to the extent the tax is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to section 245A(d) income.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP to the extent that it is allocated and apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group (the statutory grouping) under § 1.861-20. Section 1.861-20(c) allocates and apportions foreign income tax to the statutory and residual groupings to which the items of foreign gross income that were included in the foreign tax base are assigned under § 1.861-20(d). In general, § 1.861-20(d) assigns foreign gross income to the statutory and residual groupings to which the corresponding U.S. item is assigned. If a taxpayer does not recognize a corresponding U.S. item in the year in which it pays or accrues foreign income tax with respect to foreign gross income that it includes by reason of a foreign law dividend, § 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii)(B) assigns the foreign dividend amount to the same statutory or residual groupings to which the foreign dividend amount would be assigned if a distribution were made for Federal income tax purposes in the amount of, and on the date of, the foreign law distribution. Therefore, the $500x foreign dividend amount in each of Years 2 and 3 is assigned to the same statutory and residual groupings to which it would be assigned if a $500x distribution occurred on December 31 of each of those years for Federal income tax purposes.
(
1
)
Year 2 $500x deemed distribution.
CFC made no distributions in Year 1 and earned no income and made no distributions in Year 2 for Federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, Year 2, CFC has $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) and $500x of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP. If CFC distributed $500x on that date, the distribution would be a distribution of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP. A distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits is a U.S. dividend amount. Section 1.861-20(d)(3)(i) assigns the foreign dividend amount, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount, to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. dividend amount is assigned. The receipt of a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits is assigned to the residual grouping under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, all $500x foreign dividend amount would be assigned to the residual grouping, and none of the $150x withholding tax paid or accrued by USP in Year 2 would be treated as attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.
(
2
)
Year 3 $500x deemed distribution.
CFC made no distributions in Year 1 and earned no income and made no distributions in Year 2 or Year 3 for Federal income tax purposes. Consequently, as of December 31, Year 3, CFC has $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) and $500x of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP. If CFC distributed $500x on that date, the distribution would be a distribution of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP. For the reasons described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, all $500x of the foreign dividend amount would be assigned to the residual grouping, and none of the $150x withholding tax paid or accrued by USP in Year 3 would be treated as attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.
(
3
)
Year 4 $1,000x distribution.
The Year 4 $1,000x distribution is, for Country A purposes, a return of capital distribution that is not subject to withholding tax. For Federal income tax purposes, it comprises a $500x dividend for which a deduction under section 245A(a) is allowed, which is an item of section 245A(d) income of USP, and a $500x distribution of section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP, the receipt of which is income in the residual grouping.
(C)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 may be attributed to non-inclusion income of CFC if the tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to either the characterization of the tax book value of stock under § 1.861-9 or
the income of a foreign corporation that is a reverse hybrid or foreign law CFC. CFC is neither a reverse hybrid nor a foreign law CFC. In addition, no portion of the Country A withholding tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of CFC's stock. See § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i). Therefore, none of the tax is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
(D)
Attribution of foreign income taxes pursuant to anti-avoidance rule.
USP made two successive foreign law distributions in Years 2 and 3 that were subject to Country A withholding tax and that did not individually exceed, but together exceeded, the section 951(a)(1)(A) PTEP of CFC. The Country A withholding tax on each consent dividend is allocated to the residual grouping rather than to the statutory grouping of section 245A(d) income under §§ 1.861-20(d)(2)(ii) and 1.861-20(d)(3)(i). USP paid no Country A withholding tax on the Year 4 distribution as a result of the Country A consent dividends in Years 2 and 3. If CFC had distributed its earnings and profits in Year 4 without the prior consent dividends, the distribution would have been subject to withholding tax, a portion of which would have been attributable to the section 245A(d) income arising from the distribution. But for the application of the anti-avoidance rule in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USP would avoid the disallowance under section 245A(d) with respect to this portion of the withholding tax. Because USP made foreign law distributions that caused withholding tax from multiple foreign law distributions to be associated with the same previously taxed earnings and profits with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 245A(d) and this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 is treated as being attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.
(E)
Disallowance.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for the $150x Country A withholding tax paid by USP in each of Years 2 and 3 that is attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP.

Example 4: Distribution that is in part a dividend and in part a return of capital
—(i)
Facts.
CFC uses the modified gross income method to allocate and apportion its interest expense, and its stock has a tax book value of $10,000x. For Year 1, CFC earns $500x of income that is specified foreign source general category gross income as that term is defined in § 1.861-13(a)(1)(i)(A)(
9
) and is therefore neither tested income nor subpart F income of CFC. As of December 31, Year 1, CFC has $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). On that date, CFC distributes $1,000x of cash to USP. For Country A tax purposes, the entire $1,000x distribution is a dividend to USP and is therefore a foreign dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). Country A imposes a withholding tax on USP of $150x with respect to the $1,000x of foreign gross dividend income that USP includes under the law of Country A. For Federal income tax purposes, USP includes $500x of the distribution in its gross income as a dividend for which a $500x deduction is allowed to USP under section 245A(a); the remaining $500x of the distribution is applied against and reduces USP's basis in its CFC stock under section 301(c)(2). The portion of the distribution that is a $500x dividend is a U.S. dividend amount (as defined in § 1.861-20(b)). The remaining $500x of the distribution is a U.S. return of capital amount.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this section are applied by first determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the section 245A(d) income of USP, and then by determining the portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is attributable under either paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii) of this section to the non-inclusion income of CFC. No credit or deduction is allowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for any portion of the $150x Country A withholding tax that is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP or, under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for any portion of that tax that is
attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC, to the extent the tax is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to section 245A(d) income.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $150x Country A withholding tax is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP to the extent that it is allocated and apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group (the statutory grouping) under § 1.861-20. Section 1.861-20(c) allocates and apportions foreign income tax to the statutory and residual groupings to which the items of foreign gross income that were included in the foreign tax base are assigned under § 1.861-20(d). Section 1.861-20(d)(3)(i) assigns foreign gross income that is a foreign dividend amount, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount, to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. dividend amount is assigned. Of the $1,000x foreign dividend amount, $500x is therefore assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the $500x U.S. dividend amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. The entire $500x U.S. dividend amount is a dividend for which a section 245A(a) deduction is allowed and is therefore section 245A(d) income that is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group. Accordingly, $500x of the foreign dividend amount is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group. Under § 1.861-20(f), $75x ($150x × $500x/$1,000x) of the Country A withholding tax is allocated to the section 245A(d) income group and so under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP.
(C)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.
The remaining $75x of the Country A withholding tax is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because the $500x of foreign dividend amount that corresponds to the $500x U.S. return of capital amount is assigned, and the remaining withholding tax imposed on that foreign dividend amount is allocated and apportioned, by reference to the characterization of the tax book value of the stock of CFC. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the remaining $75x Country A withholding tax is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC to the extent that the tax is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-20 to USP's section 245A subgroup of general category stock, section 245A subgroup of passive category stock, and section 245A subgroup of U.S. source category stock (the statutory groupings) for purposes of section 904 as the operative section. Under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i), the $500x portion of the foreign dividend amount that corresponds to the $500x U.S. return of capital amount is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which $500x of earnings of CFC would be assigned if CFC recognized them in Year 1. Those earnings are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions of the tax book value of CFC's stock in the groupings for Year 1 for purposes of applying the asset method of expense allocation and apportionment under § 1.861-9. Under § 1.861-9, § 1.861-9T(f), and § 1.861-13, for purposes of section 904 as the operative section, all of the tax book value of the stock of CFC is assigned to USP's section 245A subgroup of general category stock because CFC uses the modified gross income method to allocate and apportion its interest expense and earns only specified foreign source general category gross income for Year 1. Under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i), if CFC recognized $500x of earnings in Year 1 these earnings would be deemed to arise in the section 245A subgroup of general category stock. Accordingly, the remaining $500x of foreign dividend amount is assigned to USP's section 245A subgroup of general category stock. Under § 1.861-20(f), the remaining $75x of withholding tax is allocated to the section 245A subgroup and, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC.
(D)
Disallowance.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for the $75x portion of the Country A withholding tax that is attributable to section 245A(d) income of USP. Under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for
the $75x portion of the Country A withholding tax that is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.

Example 5: Income of a reverse hybrid
—
(i)
Facts.
CFC is a reverse hybrid. In Year 1, CFC earns a $500x item of gain described in section 907(c)(1)(B) that is non-inclusion income. CFC also earns for Federal income tax purposes and Country A tax purposes a $1,000x item of royalty income, of which $500x is gross included tested income and $500x is non-inclusion income. USP includes the $500x item of foreign gain and the $1,000x item of foreign gross royalty income in its Country A taxable income, and the items are foreign law pass-through income. If CFC included these items under Country A tax law, its $1,000x of royalty income for Federal income tax purposes would be the corresponding U.S. item for the foreign gross royalty income, and its $500x of gain for Federal income tax purposes would be the corresponding U.S. item for the foreign gain. Country A imposes a $150x foreign income tax on USP with respect to $1,500x of foreign gross income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this section are applied by first determining the portion of the $150x Country A tax that is attributable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the section 245A(d) income of USP, and then by determining the portion of the $150x Country A tax that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is attributable under either paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section to the non-inclusion income of CFC. No credit or deduction is allowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for any portion of the $150x Country A tax that is attributable to the section 245A(d) income of USP or, under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for any portion of that tax that is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC, to the extent the tax is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to section 245A(d) income.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $150x Country A tax is attributable to section 245A(d) income to the extent the tax is allocated and apportioned to the section 245A(d) income group (the statutory grouping) under § 1.861-20. Section 1.861-20(c) allocates and apportions foreign income tax to the statutory and residual groupings to which the items of foreign gross income that were included in the foreign tax base are assigned under § 1.861-20(d). In general, § 1.861-20(d) assigns foreign gross income to the statutory and residual groupings to which the corresponding U.S. item is assigned. Section 1.861-20(d)(3)(i)(C) assigns the foreign law pass-through income that USP includes by reason of its ownership of CFC to the statutory and residual groupings by treating USP's foreign law pass-through income as foreign gross income of CFC, and by treating CFC as paying the $150x of Country A tax in CFC's U.S. taxable year within which its foreign taxable year ends (Year 1). CFC is therefore treated as including a $1,000x foreign gross royalty item and a $500x foreign gross income item of gain and paying $150x of Country A tax in Year 1. These foreign gross income items are assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the corresponding U.S. items are assigned under Federal income tax law. No foreign gross income is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group because neither the corresponding U.S. item of royalty income nor the corresponding U.S. item of gain is assigned to the section 245A(d) income group.Therefore, none of USP's Country A tax is allocated to the section 245A(d) income group.
(C)
Attribution of foreign income taxes to non-inclusion income.
The $150x Country A tax is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section because USP is a United States shareholder of CFC, CFC is a reverse hybrid, and § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i)(C) allocates and apportions the tax by reference to the income of CFC. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the $150x Country A tax is attributable to the non-inclusion income of CFC to the extent that the foreign income taxes are allocated and apportioned to the non-inclusion income group under § 1.861-20. For the reasons described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i)(C) CFC is treated as including a $1,000x foreign gross royalty item and a $500x
foreign gross income item of gain and paying $150x of Country A tax in Year 1. These foreign gross income items are assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the corresponding U.S. items are assigned under Federal income tax law. For Federal income tax purposes, the $500x item of gain and $500x of the $1,000x item of royalty income are items of non-inclusion income that are therefore assigned to the non-inclusion income group.The remaining $500x of the foreign gross royalty income item is assigned to the residual grouping. Under § 1.861-20(f), $100x ($150x × $1,000x/$1,500x) of the Country A tax is apportioned to the non-inclusion income group, and $50x ($150x × $500x/$1,500x) is apportioned to the residual grouping. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the $100x of Country A tax that is apportioned to the non-inclusion income group under § 1.861-20(d)(3)(i)(C) is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
(D)
Disallowance.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, no credit under section 901 or deduction is allowed in any taxable year to USP for the $100x of Country A foreign income tax that is attributable to non-inclusion income of CFC.
(e)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years of a foreign corporation that begin after December 31, 2019, and end on or after November 2, 2020, and with respect to a United States person, taxable years in which or with which such taxable years of the foreign corporation end.

§ 1.245A(e)-1
Special rules for hybrid dividends.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules for hybrid dividends. Paragraph (b) of this section disallows the deduction under section 245A(a) for a hybrid dividend received by a United States shareholder from a CFC. Paragraph (c) of this section provides a rule for hybrid dividends of tiered corporations. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth rules regarding a hybrid deduction account. Paragraph (e) of this section provides an anti-avoidance rule. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (g) of this section illustrates the application of the rules of this section through examples. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the applicability date.
(b)
Hybrid dividends received by United States shareholders
—(1)
In general.
If a United States shareholder receives a hybrid dividend, then—
(i) The United States shareholder is not allowed a deduction under section 245A(a) for the hybrid dividend; and
(ii) The rules of section 245A(d) and § 1.245A(d)-1 (disallowance of foreign tax credits and deductions) apply to the hybrid dividend. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section for an example illustrating the application of paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Definition of hybrid dividend.
The term
hybrid dividend
means an amount received by a United States shareholder from a CFC for which, without regard to section 245A(e) and this section as well as § 1.245A-5, the United States shareholder would be allowed a deduction under section 245A(a), to the extent of the sum of the United States shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) with respect to each share of stock of the CFC, determined at the close of the CFC's taxable year (or in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section, as applicable). No other amount received by a United States shareholder from a CFC is a hybrid dividend for purposes of section 245A.
(3)
Special rule for certain dividends attributable to earnings of lower-tier foreign corporations.
This paragraph (b)(3) applies if a domestic corporation directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of § 1.245A-5(g)(3)(ii)) sells or exchanges stock of a foreign corporation and, pursuant to section 1248, the gain recognized on the sale or exchange is included in gross income as a dividend. In such a case, for purposes of this section—
(i) To the extent that earnings and profits of a lower-tier CFC gave rise to the dividend under section 1248(c)(2), those earnings and profits are treated as distributed as a dividend by the lower-tier CFC directly to the domestic corporation under the principles of § 1.1248-1(d); and
(ii) To the extent the domestic corporation indirectly owns (within the
meaning of section 958(a)(2), and determined by treating a domestic partnership as foreign) shares of stock of the lower-tier CFC, the hybrid deduction accounts with respect to those shares are treated as the domestic corporation's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to stock of the lower-tier CFC. Thus, for example, if a domestic corporation sells or exchanges all the stock of an upper-tier CFC and under this paragraph (b)(3) there is considered to be a dividend paid directly by the lower-tier CFC to the domestic corporation, then the dividend is generally a hybrid dividend to the extent of the sum of the upper-tier CFC's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to stock of the lower-tier CFC.
(4)
Ordering rule.
Amounts received by a United States shareholder from a CFC are subject to the rules of section 245A(e) and this section based on the order in which they are received. Thus, for example, if on different days during a CFC's taxable year a United States shareholder receives dividends from the CFC, then the rules of section 245A(e) and this section apply first to the dividend received on the earliest date (based on the sum of the United States shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each share of stock of the CFC), and then to the dividend received on the next earliest date (based on the remaining sum).
(c)
Hybrid dividends of tiered corporations
—(1)
In general.
If a CFC (the
receiving CFC
) receives a tiered hybrid dividend from another CFC, and a domestic corporation is a United States shareholder with respect to both CFCs, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code—
(i) For purposes of section 951(a) as to the United States shareholder, the tiered hybrid dividend is treated for purposes of section 951(a)(1)(A) as subpart F income of the receiving CFC for the taxable year of the CFC in which the tiered hybrid dividend is received;
(ii) The United States shareholder includes in gross income an amount equal to its pro rata share (determined in the same manner as under section 951(a)(2)) of the subpart F income described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section; and
(iii) The rules of section 245A(d) and § 1.245A(d)-1 (disallowance of foreign tax credit, including for taxes that would have been deemed paid under section 960(a) or (b), and deductions) apply to the amount included under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section in the United States shareholder's gross income. See paragraph (g)(2) of this section for an example illustrating the application of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Definition of tiered hybrid dividend.
The term
tiered hybrid dividend
means an amount received by a receiving CFC from another CFC to the extent that the amount would be a hybrid dividend under paragraph (b)(2) of this section if, for purposes of section 245A and the regulations in this part under section 245A (except for section 245A(e)(2) and this paragraph (c)), the receiving CFC were a domestic corporation. A tiered hybrid dividend does not include an amount described in section 959(b). No other amount received by a receiving CFC from another CFC is a tiered hybrid dividend for purposes of section 245A.
(3)
Special rule for certain dividends attributable to earnings of lower-tier foreign corporations.
This paragraph (c)(3) applies if a CFC directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of § 1.245A-5(g)(3)(ii)) sells or exchanges stock of a foreign corporation and pursuant to section 964(e)(1) the gain recognized on the sale or exchange is included in gross income as a dividend. In such a case, the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply, by treating the CFC as the domestic corporation described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and substituting the phrase “sections 964(e)(1) and 1248(c)(2)” for the phrase “section 1248(c)(2)” in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Interaction with rules under section 964(e).
To the extent a dividend described in section 964(e)(1) (gain on certain stock sales by CFCs treated as dividends) is a tiered hybrid dividend, the rules of section 964(e)(4) do not apply as to a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of both of the CFCs described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, therefore, such United States shareholder is not allowed a deduction under section
245A(a) for the amount included in gross income under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Hybrid deduction accounts
—(1)
In general.
A specified owner of a share of CFC stock must maintain a hybrid deduction account with respect to the share. The hybrid deduction account with respect to the share must reflect the amount of hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share (as determined under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section), and must be maintained in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (d)(4) through (6) of this section.
(2)
Hybrid deductions
—(i)
In general.
The term
hybrid deduction
of a CFC means a deduction or other tax benefit (such as an exemption, exclusion, or credit, to the extent equivalent to a deduction) for which the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are both satisfied.
(A) The deduction or other tax benefit is allowed to the CFC (or a person related to the CFC) under a relevant foreign tax law, regardless of whether the deduction or other tax benefit is used, or otherwise reduces tax, currently under the relevant foreign tax law.
(B) The deduction or other tax benefit relates to or results from an amount paid, accrued, or distributed with respect to an instrument issued by the CFC and treated as stock for U.S. tax purposes, or is a deduction allowed to the CFC with respect to equity. Examples of such a deduction or other tax benefit include an interest deduction, a dividends paid deduction, and a notional interest deduction (or similar deduction determined with respect to the CFC's equity). However, a deduction or other tax benefit relating to or resulting from a distribution by the CFC that is a dividend for purposes of the relevant foreign tax law is considered a hybrid deduction only to the extent it has the effect of causing the earnings that funded the distribution to not be included in income (determined under the principles of § 1.267A-3(a)) or otherwise subject to tax under such tax law. Thus, for example, upon a distribution by a CFC that is treated as a dividend for purposes of the CFC's tax law to a shareholder of the CFC, a dividends paid deduction allowed to the CFC under its tax law (or a refund to the shareholder, including through a credit, of tax paid by the CFC on the earnings that funded the distribution) pursuant to an integration or imputation system is not a hybrid deduction of the CFC to the extent that the shareholder, if a tax resident of the CFC's country, includes the distribution in income under the CFC's tax law or, if not a tax resident of the CFC's country, is subject to withholding tax (as defined in section 901(k)(1)(B)) on the distribution under the CFC's tax law. As an additional example, upon a distribution by a CFC to a shareholder of the CFC that is a tax resident of the CFC's country, a dividends received deduction allowed to the shareholder under the tax law of such foreign country pursuant to a regime intended to relieve double-taxation within the group is not a hybrid deduction of the CFC (though if the CFC were also allowed a deduction or other tax benefit for the distribution under such tax, such deduction or other tax benefit would be a hybrid deduction of the CFC). See paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section for examples illustrating the application of paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Coordination with foreign disallowance rules.
The following special rules apply for purposes of determining whether a deduction or other tax benefit is allowed to a CFC (or a person related to the CFC) under a relevant foreign tax law:
(A) Whether the deduction or other tax benefit is allowed is determined without regard to a rule under the relevant foreign tax law that disallows or suspends deductions if a certain ratio or percentage is exceeded (for example, a thin capitalization rule that disallows interest deductions if debt to equity exceeds a certain ratio, or a rule similar to section 163(j) that disallows or suspends interest deductions if interest exceeds a certain percentage of income).
(B) Except as provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B), whether the deduction or other tax benefit is allowed is determined without regard to hybrid
mismatch rules, if any, under the relevant foreign tax law that may disallow such deduction or other tax benefit. However, whether the deduction or other tax benefit is allowed is determined with regard to hybrid mismatch rules under the relevant foreign tax law if the amount giving rise to the deduction or other tax benefit neither gives rise to a dividend for U.S. tax purposes nor, based on all the facts and circumstances, is reasonably expected to give rise to a dividend for U.S. tax purposes that will be paid within 12 months from the end of the taxable period for which the deduction or other tax benefit would be allowed but for the hybrid mismatch rules. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B), the term hybrid mismatch rules has the meaning provided in § 1.267A-5(b)(10).
(iii)
Anti-duplication rule.
A deduction or other tax benefit allowed to a CFC (or a person related to the CFC) under a relevant foreign tax law for an amount paid, accrued, or distributed with respect to an instrument issued by the CFC is not a hybrid deduction to the extent that treating it as a hybrid deduction would have the effect of duplicating a hybrid deduction that is a deduction or other tax benefit allowed under such tax law for an amount paid, accrued, or distributed with respect to an instrument that is issued by a CFC at a higher tier and that has terms substantially similar to the terms of the first instrument. For example, if an upper tier CFC issues to a corporate United States shareholder a hybrid instrument (the “upper tier instrument”), a lower tier CFC issues to the upper tier CFC a hybrid instrument that has terms substantially similar to the terms of the upper tier instrument (the “mirror instrument”), the CFCs are tax residents of the same foreign country, and the upper tier CFC includes in income under its tax law (as determined under the principles of § 1.267A-3(a)) amounts accrued with respect to the mirror instrument, then a deduction allowed to the lower tier CFC under such foreign tax law for an amount accrued pursuant to the mirror instrument is not a hybrid deduction (but a deduction allowed to the upper tier CFC under the foreign tax law for an amount accrued with respect to the upper tier instrument is a hybrid deduction).
(iv)
Application limited to items allowed in taxable years ending on or after December 20, 2018; special rule for deductions with respect to equity.
A deduction or other tax benefit, other than a deduction with respect to equity, allowed to a CFC (or a person related to the CFC) under a relevant foreign tax law is taken into account for purposes of this section only if it was allowed with respect to a taxable year under the relevant foreign tax law ending on or after December 20, 2018. A deduction with respect to equity allowed to a CFC under a relevant foreign tax law is taken into account for purposes of this section only if it was allowed with respect to a taxable year under the relevant foreign tax law beginning on or after December 20, 2018.
(3)
Allocating hybrid deductions to shares.
A hybrid deduction is allocated to a share of stock of a CFC to the extent that the hybrid deduction (or amount equivalent to a deduction) relates to an amount paid, accrued, or distributed by the CFC with respect to the share. However, in the case of a hybrid deduction that is a deduction with respect to equity (such as a notional interest deduction), the deduction is allocated to a share of stock of a CFC based on the product of—
(i) The amount of the deduction allowed for all of the equity of the CFC; and
(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the share and the denominator of which is the value of all of the stock of the CFC.
(4)
Maintenance of hybrid deduction accounts
—(i)
In general.
A specified owner's hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of a CFC is, as of the close of the taxable year of the CFC, adjusted pursuant to the following rules.
(A) First, the account is increased by the amount of hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year.
(B) Second, the account is decreased (but not below zero) pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section, in the order set forth in this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B).

Adjusted subpart F inclusions
—(
i
)
In general.
Subject to the limitation in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, the account is reduced by an adjusted subpart F inclusion with respect to the share for the taxable year, as determined pursuant to the rules of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(
ii
)
Limitation.
The reduction pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section cannot exceed the hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the items of gross income of the CFC that give rise to subpart F income (determined without regard to an amount treated as subpart F income by reason of section 964(e)(4)(A)(i), to the extent that a deduction under section 245A(a) is allowed for a portion of the amount included under section 964(e)(4)(A)(ii) in the gross income of a domestic corporation) of the CFC for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the sum of all the items of gross income of the CFC for the taxable year.
(
iii
)
Special rule allocating otherwise unused adjusted subpart F inclusions across accounts in certain cases.
This paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
iii
) applies after each of the specified owner's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to its shares of stock of the CFC are adjusted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section but before the accounts are adjusted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, to the extent that one or more of the hybrid deduction accounts would have been reduced by an amount pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section but for the limitation in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section (the aggregate of the amounts that would have been reduced but for the limitation, the
unused reduction amount,
and the accounts that would have been reduced by the unused reduction amount, the
unused reduction amount accounts
). When this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
iii
) applies, the specified owner's hybrid deduction accounts other than the unused reduction amount accounts (if any) are ratably reduced by the lesser of the unused reduction amount and the difference of the following two amounts: The hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the specified owner's shares of stock of the CFC for the taxable year multiplied by the fraction described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section; and the reductions pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section with respect to the specified owner's shares of stock of the CFC.

Adjusted GILTI inclusions
—(
i
)
In general.
Subject to the limitation in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, the account is reduced by an adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to the share for the taxable year, as determined pursuant to the rules of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(
ii
)
Limitation.
The reduction pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section cannot exceed the hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the items of gross tested income of the CFC for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the sum of all the items of gross income of the CFC for the taxable year.
(

)
Special rule allocating otherwise unused adjusted GILTI inclusions across accounts in certain cases.
This paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
iii
) applies after each of the specified owner's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to its shares of stock of the CFC are adjusted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section but before the accounts are adjusted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(

2
)(
ii
) of this section (the aggregate of the amounts that would have been reduced but for the limitation, the
unused reduction amount,
and the accounts that would have been reduced by the unused reduction amount, the
unused reduction amount accounts
). When this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
iii
) applies, the specified owner's hybrid deduction accounts other than the unused reduction amount accounts (if any) are ratably reduced by the lesser of the unused reduction amount and the difference of the following two amounts: The hybrid deductions of the
CFC allocated to the specified owner's shares of stock of the CFC for the taxable year multiplied by the fraction described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(

)(
iii
).
(
3
)
Certain section 956 inclusions.
The account is reduced by an amount included in the gross income of a domestic corporation under sections 951(a)(1)(B) and 956 with respect to the share for the taxable year of the domestic corporation in which or with which the CFC's taxable year ends, to the extent so included by reason of the application of section 245A(e) and this section to the hypothetical distribution described in § 1.956-1(a)(2).
(C) Third, the account is decreased by the amount of hybrid deductions in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during the taxable year. If the specified owner has more than one hybrid deduction account with respect to its stock of the CFC, then a pro rata amount in each hybrid deduction account is considered to have given rise to the hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend, based on the amounts in the accounts before applying this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C).
(ii)
Rules regarding adjusted subpart F and GILTI inclusions.
(A) The term
adjusted subpart F inclusion
means, with respect to a share of stock of a CFC for a taxable year of the CFC, a domestic corporation's pro rata share of the CFC's subpart F income included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) (determined without regard to an amount included in gross income by the domestic corporation by reason of section 964(e)(4)(A)(ii), to the extent a deduction under section 245A(a) is allowed for the amount) for the taxable year of the domestic corporation in which or with which the CFC's taxable year ends, to the extent attributable to the share (as determined under the principles of section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e)), adjusted (but not below zero) by—
(
1
) Adding to the amount the associated foreign income taxes with respect to the amount; and
(
2
) Subtracting from such sum the quotient of the associated foreign income taxes divided by the percentage described in section 11(b).
(B) The term
adjusted GILTI inclusion
means, with respect to a share of stock of a CFC for a taxable year of the CFC, a domestic corporation's GILTI inclusion amount (within the meaning of § 1.951A-1(c)(1)) for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year (within the meaning of § 1.951A-1(f)(7)), to the extent attributable to the share (as determined under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section), adjusted (but not below zero) by—
(
1
) Adding to the amount the associated foreign income taxes with respect to the amount;
(
2
) Multiplying such sum by the difference of 100 percent and the section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) deduction percentage; and
(
3
) Subtracting from such product the quotient of 80 percent of the associated foreign income taxes divided by the percentage described in section 11(b).
(C) A domestic corporation's GILTI inclusion amount for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year is attributable to a share of stock of the CFC based on a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the domestic corporation's pro rata share of the tested income of the CFC for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year, to the extent attributable to the share (as determined under the principles of § 1.951A-1(d)(2)); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the aggregate of the domestic corporation's pro rata share of the tested income of each tested income CFC (as defined in § 1.951A-2(b)(1)) for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year.
(D) The term
associated foreign income taxes
means—
(
1
) With respect to a domestic corporation's pro rata share of the subpart F income of the CFC included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) and attributable to a share of stock of a CFC for a taxable year of the CFC, current year tax (as described in § 1.960-1(b)(4)) allocated and apportioned
under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to the subpart F income groups (as described in § 1.960-1(b)(30)) of the CFC for the taxable year, to the extent allocated to the share under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(E) of this section; and
(
2
) With respect to a domestic corporation's GILTI inclusion amount under section 951A attributable to a share of stock of a CFC for a taxable year of the CFC, the product of—
(
i
) Current year tax (as described in § 1.960-1(b)(4)) allocated and apportioned under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to the tested income groups (as described in § 1.960-1(b)(33)) of the CFC for the taxable year, to the extent allocated to the share under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(F) of this section;
(
ii
) The domestic corporation's inclusion percentage (as described in § 1.960-2(c)(2)); and
(
iii
) The section 904 limitation fraction with respect to the domestic corporation for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year.
(E) Current year tax allocated and apportioned to a subpart F income group of a CFC for a taxable year is allocated to a share of stock of the CFC by multiplying the foreign income tax by a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the domestic corporation's pro rata share of the subpart F income of the CFC for the taxable year, to the extent attributable to the share (as determined under the principles of section 951(a)(2) and § 1.951-1(b) and (e)); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the subpart F income of the CFC for the taxable year.
(F) Current year tax allocated and apportioned to a tested income group of a CFC for a taxable year is allocated to a share of stock of the CFC by multiplying the foreign income tax by a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the domestic corporation's pro rata share of tested income of the CFC for the taxable year, to the extent attributable to the share (as determined under the principles § 1.951A-1(d)(2)); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the tested income of the CFC for the taxable year.
(G) The term
section 904 limitation fraction
means, with respect to a domestic corporation for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year, a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the amount of foreign tax credits for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year that, by reason of sections 901 and 960(d) and taking into account section 904, the domestic corporation is allowed for the separate category set forth in section 904(d)(1)(A) (amounts includible in gross income under section 951A); and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the amount of foreign tax credits for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year that, by reason of sections 901 and 960(d) and without regard to section 904, the domestic corporation would be allowed for the separate category set forth in section 904(d)(1)(A) (amounts includible in gross income under section 951A).
(H) The term
section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) deduction percentage
means, with respect to a domestic corporation for a U.S. shareholder inclusion year, a fraction—
(

(
2
) The denominator of which is the domestic corporation's GILTI inclusion amount for the U.S. shareholder inclusion year.
(iii)
Acquisition of account and certain other adjustments
—(A)
In general.
The following rules apply when a person (the
acquirer
) directly or indirectly through a partnership, trust, or estate acquires a share of stock of a CFC from another person (the
transferor
).
(
1
) In the case of an acquirer that is a specified owner of the share immediately after the acquisition, the transferor's hybrid deduction account, if any, with respect to the share becomes the hybrid deduction account of the acquirer.
(
2
) In the case of an acquirer that is not a specified owner of the share immediately after the acquisition, the transferor's hybrid deduction account, if any, is eliminated and accordingly is not thereafter taken into account by any person.
(B)
Additional rules.
The following rules apply in addition to the rules of paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section.
(
1
)
Certain section 354 or 356 exchanges.
The following rules apply when a shareholder of a CFC (the CFC, the
target CFC;
the shareholder, the
exchanging shareholder
) exchanges stock of the target CFC for stock of another CFC (the
acquiring CFC
) pursuant to an exchange described in section 354 or 356 that occurs in connection with a transaction described in section 381(a)(2) in which the target CFC is the transferor corporation.
(
i
) In the case of an exchanging shareholder that is a specified owner of one or more shares of stock of the acquiring CFC immediately after the exchange, the exchanging shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to the shares of stock of the target CFC that it exchanges are attributed to the shares of stock of the acquiring CFC that it receives in the exchange.
(

) In the case of an exchanging shareholder that is not a specified owner of one or more shares of stock of the acquiring CFC immediately after the exchange, the exchanging shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to its shares of stock of the target CFC are eliminated and accordingly are not thereafter taken into account by any person.

Section 332 liquidations.
If a CFC is a distributor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a)(1) (the
distributor CFC
) in which a controlled foreign corporation is the acquiring corporation (the
distributee CFC
), then each hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of the distributee CFC is increased pro rata by the sum of the hybrid deduction accounts with respect to shares of stock of the distributor CFC.

Recapitalizations.
If a shareholder of a CFC exchanges stock of the CFC pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) or a transaction to which section 1036 applies, then the shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to the stock of the CFC that it exchanges are attributed to the shares of stock of the CFC that it receives in the exchange.

Certain distributions involving section 355 or 356.
In the case of a transaction involving a distribution under section 355 (or so much of section 356 as it relates to section 355) by a CFC (the
distributing CFC
) of stock of another CFC (the
controlled CFC
), the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts with respect to stock of the distributing CFC is attributed to stock of the controlled CFC in a manner similar to how earnings and profits of the distributing CFC and controlled CFC are adjusted. To the extent the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts with respect to stock of the distributing CFC is not so attributed to stock of the controlled CFC, such balance remains as the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts with respect to stock of the distributing CFC.

Effect of section 338(g) election
—(

)
In general.
If an election under section 338(g) is made with respect to a qualified stock purchase (as described in section 338(d)(3)) of stock of a CFC, then a hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of the old target is not treated as (or attributed to) a hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of the new target. Accordingly, immediately after the deemed asset sale described in § 1.338-1, the balance of a hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of stock of the new target is zero; the account must then be maintained in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d) of this section.

Special rule regarding carryover FT stock.
Paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
5
)(
i
) of this section does not apply as to a hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of carryover FT stock (as described in § 1.338-9(b)(3)(i)). A hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of carryover FT stock is attributed to the corresponding share of stock of the new target.
(5)
Determinations and adjustments made during year of transfer in certain cases.
This paragraph (d)(5) applies if on a date other than the date that is the last day of the CFC's taxable year a United States shareholder of the CFC or an upper-tier CFC with respect to the CFC directly or indirectly (as determined under the principles of § 1.245A-5(g)(3)(ii)) transfers a share of stock of the CFC, and, during the taxable year, but on or before the transfer date, the United States shareholder or upper-tier CFC receives an amount from the CFC that is subject to the
rules of section 245A(e) and this section. In such a case, the following rules apply:
(i) As to the United States shareholder or upper-tier CFC and the United States shareholder's or upper-tier CFC's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each share of stock of the CFC (regardless of whether such share is transferred), the determinations and adjustments under this section that would otherwise be made at the close of the CFC's taxable year are made at the close of the date of the transfer. When making these determinations and adjustments at the close of the date of the transfer, each hybrid deduction account described in the previous sentence is pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section increased by a ratable portion (based on the number of days in the taxable year within the pre-transfer period to the total number of days in the taxable year) of the hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year, and pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section decreased by the amount of hybrid deductions in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during the portion of the taxable year up to and including the transfer date. Thus, for example, if a United States shareholder of a CFC exchanges stock of the CFC in an exchange described in § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) and is required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock exchanged, then: As of the close of the date of the exchange, each of the United States shareholder's hybrid deductions accounts with respect to a share of stock of the CFC is increased by a ratable portion of the hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year (based on the number of days in the taxable year within the pre-transfer period to the total number of days in the taxable year); the deemed dividend is a hybrid dividend to the extent of the sum of the United States shareholder's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each share of stock of the CFC; and, as the close of the date of the exchange, each of the accounts is decreased by the amount of hybrid deductions in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend during the portion of the taxable year up to and including the date of the exchange.
(ii) As to a hybrid deduction account described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the adjustments to the account as of the close of the taxable year of the CFC must take into account the adjustments, if any, occurring with respect to the account pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section. Thus, for example, if an acquisition of a share of stock of a CFC occurs on a date other than the date that is the last day of the CFC's taxable year and pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section the acquirer succeeds to the transferor's hybrid deduction account with respect to the share, then, as of the close of the taxable year of the CFC, the account is increased by a ratable portion of the hybrid deductions of the CFC allocated to the share for the taxable year (based on the number of days in the taxable year within the post-transfer period to the total number of days in the taxable year), and, decreased by the amount of hybrid deductions in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during the portion of the taxable year following the transfer date.
(6)
Effects of CFC functional currency
—(i)
Maintenance of the hybrid deduction account.
A hybrid deduction account with respect to a share of CFC stock must be maintained in the functional currency (within the meaning of section 985) of the CFC. Thus, for example, the amount of a hybrid deduction and the adjustments described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are determined based on the functional currency of the CFC. In addition, for purposes of this section, the amount of a deduction or other tax benefit allowed to a CFC (or a person related to the CFC) is determined taking into account foreign currency gain or loss recognized with respect to such deduction or other tax benefit under a provision of foreign tax law comparable to section 988 (treatment of certain foreign currency transactions).
(ii)
Determination of amount of hybrid dividend.
This paragraph (d)(6)(ii) applies if a CFC's functional currency is other than the functional currency of a
United States shareholder or upper-tier CFC that receives an amount from the CFC that is subject to the rules of section 245A(e) and this section. In such a case, the sum of the United States shareholder's or upper-tier CFC's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each share of stock of the CFC is, for purposes of determining the extent that a dividend is a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend, translated into the functional currency of the United States shareholder or upper-tier CFC based on the spot rate (within the meaning of § 1.988-1(d)) as of the date of the dividend.
(e)
Anti-avoidance rule.
Appropriate adjustments are made pursuant to this section, including adjustments that would disregard the transaction or arrangement, if a transaction or arrangement is undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 245A(e) and this section. For example, if a specified owner of a share of CFC stock transfers the share to another person, and a principal purpose of the transfer is to shift the hybrid deduction account with respect to the share to the other person or to cause the hybrid deduction account to be eliminated, then for purposes of this section the shifting or elimination of the hybrid deduction account is disregarded as to the transferor. As another example, if a transaction or arrangement is undertaken to affirmatively fail to satisfy the holding period requirement under section 246(c)(5) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tiered hybrid dividend rules described in paragraph (c) of this section, the transaction or arrangement is disregarded for purposes of this section. This paragraph (e) will not apply, however, to disregard (or make other adjustments with respect to) a transaction pursuant to which an instrument or arrangement that gives rise to hybrid deductions is eliminated or otherwise converted into another instrument or arrangement that does not give rise to hybrid deductions.
(f)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1) The term
controlled foreign corporation
(or
CFC
) has the meaning provided in section 957.
(2) The term
domestic corporation
means an entity classified as a domestic corporation under section 7701(a)(3) and (4) or otherwise treated as a domestic corporation by the Internal Revenue Code. However, for purposes of this section, a domestic corporation does not include a regulated investment company (as described in section 851), a real estate investment trust (as described in section 856), or an S corporation (as described in section 1361).
(3) The term
person
has the meaning provided in section 7701(a)(1).
(4) The term
related
has the meaning provided in this paragraph (f)(4). A person is related to a CFC if the person is a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3).
See also
§ 1.954-1(f)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
) (neither section 318(a)(3), nor § 1.958-2(d) or the principles thereof, applies to attribute stock or other interests).
(5) The term
relevant foreign tax law
means, with respect to a CFC, any regime of any foreign country or possession of the United States that imposes an income, war profits, or excess profits tax with respect to income of the CFC, other than a foreign anti-deferral regime under which a person that owns an interest in the CFC is liable to tax. If a foreign country has an income tax treaty with the United States that applies to taxes imposed by a political subdivision or other local authority of that country, then the tax law of the political subdivision or other local authority is deemed to be a tax law of a foreign country. Thus, the term includes any regime of a foreign country or possession of the United States that imposes income, war profits, or excess profits tax under which—
(i) The CFC is liable to tax as a resident;
(ii) The CFC has a branch that gives rise to a taxable presence in the foreign country or possession of the United States; or
(iii) A person related to the CFC is liable to tax as a resident, provided that under such person's tax law the person is allowed a deduction for amounts paid or accrued by the CFC (because the CFC is fiscally transparent under the person's tax law).
(6) The term
specified owner
means, with respect to a share of stock of a
CFC, a person for which the requirements of paragraphs (f)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied.
(i) The person is a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of the CFC, or is an upper-tier CFC that would be a United States shareholder of the CFC were the upper-tier CFC a domestic corporation (provided that, for purposes of sections 951 and 951A, a domestic corporation that is a United States shareholder of the upper-tier CFC owns (within the meaning of section 958(a), and determined by treating a domestic partnership as foreign) one or more shares of stock of the upper-tier CFC).
(ii) The person owns the share directly or indirectly through a partnership, trust, or estate. Thus, for example, if a domestic corporation directly owns all the shares of stock of an upper-tier CFC and the upper-tier CFC directly owns all the shares of stock of another CFC, the domestic corporation is the specified owner with respect to each share of stock of the upper-tier CFC and the upper-tier CFC is the specified owner with respect to each share of stock of the other CFC.
(7) The term
United States shareholder
has the meaning provided in section 951(b).
(g)
Examples.
This paragraph (g) provides examples that illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (g), unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are presumed. US1 is a domestic corporation. FX and FZ are CFCs formed at the beginning of year 1, and the functional currency (within the meaning of section 985) of each of FX and FZ is the dollar. FX is a tax resident of Country X and FZ is a tax resident of Country Z. US1 is a United States shareholder with respect to FX and FZ. No distributed amounts are attributable to amounts which are, or have been, included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a). All instruments are treated as stock for U.S. tax purposes. Only the tax law of the United States contains hybrid mismatch rules. No amounts are included in the gross income of US1 under section 951(a)(1)(A), 951A(a), or 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956.
(1)
Example 1. Hybrid dividend resulting from hybrid instrument
—(i)
Facts.
US1 holds both shares of stock of FX, which have an equal value. One share is treated as indebtedness for Country X tax purposes (“Share A”), and the other is treated as equity for Country X tax purposes (“Share B”). During year 1, under Country X tax law, FX accrues $80x of interest to US1 with respect to Share A and is allowed a deduction for the amount (the “Hybrid Instrument Deduction”). During year 2, FX distributes $30x to US1 with respect to each of Share A and Share B. For U.S. tax purposes, each of the $30x distributions is treated as a dividend for which, without regard to section 245A(e) and this section as well as § 1.245A-5, US1 would be allowed a deduction under section 245A(a). For Country X tax purposes, the $30x distribution with respect to Share A represents a payment of interest for which a deduction was already allowed (and thus FX is not allowed an additional deduction for the amount), and the $30x distribution with respect to Share B is treated as a dividend (for which no deduction is allowed).
(ii)
Analysis.
The entire $30x of each dividend received by US1 from FX during year 2 is a hybrid dividend, because the sum of US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FX stock at the end of year 2 ($80x) is at least equal to the amount of the dividends ($60x).
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This is the case for the $30x dividend with respect to Share B even though there are no hybrid deductions allocated to Share B.
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As a result, US1 is not allowed a deduction under section 245A(a) for the entire $60x of hybrid dividends and the rules of section 245A(d) and § 1.245A(d)-1 (disallowance of foreign tax credits and deductions) apply.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section describe the determinations under this section.
(A) At the end of year 1, US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B are $80x and $0, respectively, calculated as follows.
(
1
) The $80x Hybrid Instrument Deduction allowed to FX under Country X tax law (a relevant foreign tax law) is a hybrid deduction of FX, because the
deduction is allowed to FX and relates to or results from an amount accrued with respect to an instrument issued by FX and treated as stock for U.S. tax purposes.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Thus, FX's hybrid deductions for year 1 are $80x.
(
2
) The entire $80x Hybrid Instrument Deduction is allocated to Share A, because the deduction was accrued with respect to Share A.
See
paragraph (d)(3) of this section. As there are no additional hybrid deductions of FX for year 1, there are no additional hybrid deductions to allocate to either Share A or Share B. Thus, there are no hybrid deductions allocated to Share B.
(
3
) At the end of year 1, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is increased by $80x (the amount of hybrid deductions allocated to Share A).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Because FX did not pay any dividends with respect to either Share A or Share B during year 1 (and therefore did not pay any hybrid dividends or tiered hybrid dividends), no further adjustments are made.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Therefore, at the end of year 1, US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B are $80x and $0, respectively.
(B) At the end of year 2, and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section, US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B remain $80x and $0, respectively. This is because there are no hybrid deductions of FX for year 2.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(C) Because at the end of year 2 (and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section) the sum of US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B ($80x, calculated as $80x plus $0) is at least equal to the aggregate $60x of year 2 dividends, the entire $60x dividend is a hybrid dividend.
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(D) At the end of year 2, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is decreased by $60x, the amount of the hybrid deductions in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during year 2.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Because there are no hybrid deductions in the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share B, no adjustments with respect to that account are made under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Therefore, at the end of year 2 and taking into account the adjustments under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is $20x ($80x less $60x) and with respect to Share B is $0.
(iii)
Alternative facts—notional interest deductions.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, except that for each of year 1 and year 2 FX is allowed $10x of notional interest deductions with respect to its equity, Share B, under Country X tax law (the “NIDs”). In addition, during year 2, FX distributes $47.5x (rather than $30x) to US1 with respect to each of Share A and Share B. For U.S. tax purposes, each of the $47.5x distributions is treated as a dividend for which, without regard to section 245A(e) and this section as well as § 1.245A-5, US1 would be allowed a deduction under section 245A(a). For Country X tax purposes, the $47.5x distribution with respect to Share A represents a payment of interest for which a deduction was already allowed (and thus FX is not allowed an additional deduction for the amount), and the $47.5x distribution with respect to Share B is treated as a dividend (for which no deduction is allowed). The entire $47.5x of each dividend received by US1 from FX during year 2 is a hybrid dividend, because the sum of US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FX stock at the end of year 2 ($80x plus $20x, or $100x) is at least equal to the amount of the dividends ($95x).
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. As a result, US1 is not allowed a deduction under section 245A(a) for the $95x hybrid dividend and the rules of section 245A(d) and § 1.245A(d)-1 (disallowance of foreign tax credits and deductions) apply.
See
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Paragraphs (g)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section describe the determinations under this section.
(A) The $10x of NIDs allowed to FX under Country X tax law in year 1 are hybrid deductions of FX for year 1.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The
$10x of NIDs is allocated equally to each of Share A and Share B, because the hybrid deduction is with respect to equity and the shares have an equal value.
See
paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Thus, $5x of the NIDs is allocated to each of Share A and Share B for year 1. For the reasons described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the entire $80x Hybrid Instrument Deduction is allocated to Share A. Therefore, at the end of year 1, US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B are $85x and $5x, respectively.
(B) Similarly, the $10x of NIDs allowed to FX under Country X tax law in year 2 are hybrid deductions of FX for year 2, and $5x of the NIDs is allocated to each of Share A and Share B for year 2.
See
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(3) of this section. Thus, at the end of year 2 (and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section), US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is $90x ($85x plus $5x) and with respect to Share B is $10x ($5x plus $5x).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(C) Because at the end of year 2 (and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section) the sum of US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B ($100x, calculated as $90x plus $10x) is at least equal to the aggregate $95x of year 2 dividends, the entire $95x of dividends are hybrid dividends.
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(D) At the end of year 2, US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B are decreased by the amount of hybrid deductions in the accounts that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during year 2.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. A total of $95x of hybrid deductions in the accounts gave rise to a hybrid dividend during year 2. For the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A, $85.5x in the account is considered to have given rise to a hybrid deduction (calculated as $95x multiplied by $90x/$100x).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. For the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share B, $9.5x in the account is considered to have given rise to a hybrid deduction (calculated as $95x multiplied by $10x/$100x).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Thus, following these adjustments, at the end of year 2, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is $4.5x ($90x less $85.5x) and with respect to Share B is $0.5x ($10x less $9.5x).
(iv)
Alternative facts—deduction in branch country
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, except that for Country X tax purposes Share A is treated as equity (and thus the Hybrid Instrument Deduction does not exist, and under Country X tax law FX is not allowed a deduction for the $30x distributed in year 2 with respect to Share A). However, FX has a branch in Country Z that gives rise to a taxable presence under Country Z tax law, and for Country Z tax purposes Share A is treated as indebtedness and Share B is treated as equity. Also, during year 1, for Country Z tax purposes, FX accrues $80x of interest to US1 with respect to Share A and is allowed an $80x interest deduction with respect to its Country Z branch income. Moreover, for Country Z tax purposes, the $30x distribution with respect to Share A in year 2 represents a payment of interest for which a deduction was already allowed (and thus FX is not allowed an additional deduction for the amount), and the $30x distribution with respect to Share B in year 2 is treated as a dividend (for which no deduction is allowed).
(B)
Analysis.
The $80x interest deduction allowed to FX under Country Z tax law (a relevant foreign tax law) with respect to its Country Z branch income is a hybrid deduction of FX for year 1.
See
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (f)(5) of this section. For reasons similar to those discussed in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, at the end of year 2 (and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section), US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to Share A and Share B are $80x and $0, respectively, and the sum of the accounts is $80x. Accordingly, the entire $60x of the year 2 dividend is a hybrid dividend.
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Further, for the reasons described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, at the end of year 2 and taking into account the adjustments under paragraph
(d)(4)(i)(C) of this section, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is $20x ($80x less $60x) and with respect to Share B is $0.
(v)
Alternative facts—account reduced by adjusted GILTI inclusion.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, except that for taxable year 1 FX has $130x of gross tested income and $10.5x of current year tax (as described in § 1.960-1(b)(4)) that is allocated and apportioned under § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) to the tested income groups of FX. US1's ability to credit the $10.5x of current year tax is not limited under section 904(a). In addition, FX has $119.5x of tested income ($130x of gross tested income, less the $10.5x of current year tax deductions properly allocable to the gross tested income). Further, of US1's pro rata share of the tested income ($119.5x), $80x is attributable to Share A and $39.5x is attributable to Share B (as determined under the principles of § 1.951A-1(d)(2)). Moreover, US1's net deemed tangible income return (as defined in § 1.951A-1(c)(3)) for taxable year 1 is $71.7x, and US1 does not own any stock of a CFC other than its stock of FX. Thus, US1's GILTI inclusion amount (within the meaning of § 1.951A-1(c)(1)) for taxable year 1, the U.S. shareholder inclusion year, is $47.8x (net CFC tested income of $119.5x, less net deemed tangible income return of $71.7x) and US1's inclusion percentage (as described in § 1.960-2(c)(2)) is 40 ($47.8x/$119.5x). The deduction allowed to US1 under section 250 by reason of section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) is not limited as a result of section 250(a)(2)(B). At the end of year 1, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is: First, increased by $80x (the amount of hybrid deductions allocated to Share A); and second, decreased by $10x (the sum of the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share A, and the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share B that is allocated to the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A) to $70x.
See
paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. In year 2, the entire $30x of each dividend received by US1 from FX during year 2 is a hybrid dividend, because the sum of US1's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FX stock at the end of year 2 ($70x) is at least equal to the amount of the dividends ($60x).
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the end of year 2, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is decreased by $60x (the amount of the hybrid deductions in the account that give rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during year 2) to $10x.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (C) of this section describe the computations pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(A) To determine the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share A for taxable year 1, it must be determined to what extent US1's $47.8x GILTI inclusion amount is attributable to Share A.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. Here, $32x of the inclusion is attributable to Share A, calculated as $47.8x multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $80x (US1's pro rata share of the tested income of FX attributable to Share A) and denominator of which is $119.5x (US1's pro rata share of the tested income of FX, its only CFC).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. Next, the associated foreign income taxes with respect to the $32x GILTI inclusion amount attributable to Share A must be determined.
See
paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B) and (D) of this section. Such associated foreign income taxes are $2.8x, calculated as $10.5x (the current year tax allocated and apportioned to the tested income groups of FX) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $80x (US1's pro rata share of the tested income of FX attributable to Share A) and the denominator of which is $119.5x (the tested income of FX), multiplied by 40% (US1's inclusion percentage), multiplied by 1 (the section 904 limitation fraction with respect to US1's GILTI inclusion amount).
See
paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(D), (F), and (G) of this section. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share A is $6.7x, computed by—
(
1
) Adding $2.8x (the associated foreign income taxes with respect to the $32x GILTI inclusion attributable to Share A) to $32x, which is $34.8x;
(
2
) Multiplying $34.8x (the sum of the amounts in paragraph (g)(1)(v)(A)(
1
) of
this section) by 50% (the difference of 100 percent and the section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) deduction percentage), which is $17.4x; and
(
3
) Subtracting $10.7x (calculated as $2.24x (80% of the $2.8x of associated foreign income taxes) divided by .21 (the percentage described in section 11(b)) from $17.4x (the product of the amounts in paragraph (g)(1)(v)(A)(
2
) of this section), which is $6.7x.
(B) Pursuant to computations similar to those discussed in paragraph (g)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share B is $3.3x. However, the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share B is not reduced by such $3.3x, because of the limitation in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, which, with respect to Share B, limits the reduction pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section to $0 (calculated as $0, the hybrid deductions allocated to the share for the taxable year, multiplied by 1, the fraction described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section (computed as $130x, the sole item of gross tested income, divided by $130x, the sole item of gross income)).
See
paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section.
(C) US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is reduced by the entire $6.7x adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to the share, as such $6.7x does not exceed the limit in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section ($80x, calculated as $80x, the hybrid deductions allocated to the share for the taxable year, multiplied by 1, the fraction described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(

)(
ii
) of this section).
See
paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section. In addition, the hybrid deduction account is reduced by another $3.3x, the amount of the adjusted GILTI inclusion with respect to Share B that is allocated to the hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section. As a result, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(

) of this section, US1's hybrid deduction account with respect to Share A is reduced by $10x ($6.7x plus $3.3x).

Example 2. Tiered hybrid dividend rule; tax benefit equivalent to a deduction
—(i)
Facts.
US1 holds all the stock of FX, and FX holds all 100 shares of stock of FZ (the “FZ shares”), which have an equal value. The FZ shares are treated as equity for Country Z tax purposes. At the end of year 1, the sum of FX's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FZ stock is $0. During year 2, FZ distributes $10x to FX with respect to each of the FZ shares, for a total of $1,000x. The $1,000x is treated as a dividend for U.S. and Country Z tax purposes, and is not deductible for Country Z tax purposes. If FX were a domestic corporation, then, without regard to section 245A(e) and this section as well as § 1.245A-5, FX would be allowed a deduction under section 245A(a) for the $1,000x. Under Country Z tax law, 75% of the corporate income tax paid by a Country Z corporation with respect to a dividend distribution is refunded to the corporation's shareholders (regardless of where such shareholders are tax residents) upon a dividend distribution by the corporation. The corporate tax rate in Country Z is 20%. With respect to FZ's distributions, FX is allowed a refundable tax credit of $187.5x. The $187.5x refundable tax credit is calculated as $1,250x (the amount of pre-tax earnings that funded the distribution, determined as $1,000x (the amount of the distribution) divided by 0.8 (the percentage of pre-tax earnings that a Country Z corporation retains after paying Country Z corporate tax)) multiplied by 0.2 (the Country Z corporate tax rate) multiplied by 0.75 (the percentage of the Country Z tax credit). Under Country Z tax law, FX is not subject to Country Z withholding tax (or any other tax) with respect to the $1,000x dividend distribution.
(ii)
Analysis.
As described in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, the sum of FX's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FZ stock at the end of year 2 is $937.5x and, as a result, $937.5x of the $1,000x of dividends received by FX from FZ during year 2 is a tiered hybrid dividend.
See
paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section. The $937.5x tiered hybrid dividend is treated for purposes of section 951(a)(1)(A) as subpart F income of FX and US1 must include in gross income its pro rata share of such subpart F income, which is $937.5x.
See
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This is the case notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, including section 952(c) or section 954(c)(3) or (6). In addition, the rules of section 245A(d) and § 1.245A(d)-1 (disallowance of foreign tax credits and deductions) apply with respect to US1's inclusion.
See
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section describe the determinations under this section. The characterization of the FZ stock for Country X tax purposes (or for purposes of any other foreign tax law) does not affect this analysis.
(A) The $187.5x refundable tax credit allowed to FX under Country Z tax law (a relevant foreign tax law) is equivalent to a $937.5x deduction, calculated as $187.5x (the amount of the credit) divided by 0.2 (the Country Z corporate tax rate). The $937.5x is a hybrid deduction of FZ because it is allowed to FX (a person related to FZ), it relates to or results from amounts distributed with respect to instruments issued by FZ and treated as stock for U.S. tax purposes, and it has the effect of causing the earnings that funded the distributions to not be included in income under Country Z tax law.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. $9.375x of the hybrid deduction is allocated to each of the FZ shares, calculated as $937.5x (the amount of the hybrid deduction) multiplied by 1/100 (the value of each FZ share relative to the value of all the FZ shares).
See
paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The result would be the same if FX were instead a tax resident of Country Z (and not Country X), FX were allowed the $187.5x refundable tax credit under Country Z tax law, and under Country Z tax law FX were to not include the $1,000x in income (because, for example, Country Z tax law provides Country Z resident corporations a 100% exclusion or dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from a resident corporation).
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(B) At the end of year 2, and before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section, the sum of FX's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to each of its shares of FZ stock is $937.5x, calculated as $9.375x (the amount in each account) multiplied by 100 (the number of accounts).
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. Accordingly, $937.5x of the $1,000x dividend received by FX from FZ during year 2 is a tiered hybrid dividend.
See
paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section.
(C) At the end of year 2, each of FX's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to its shares of FZ is decreased by the $9.375x in the account that gave rise to a hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend during year 2.
See
paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Thus, following these adjustments, at the end of year 2, each of FX's hybrid deduction accounts with respect to its shares of FZ stock is $0, calculated as $9.375x (the amount in the account before the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section) less $9.375x (the adjustment described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of this section with respect to the account).
(iii)
Alternative facts—imputation system that taxes shareholders.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, except that under Country Z tax law the $1,000x dividend to FX is subject to a 30% gross basis withholding tax, or $300x, and the $187.5x refundable tax credit is applied against and reduces the withholding tax to $112.5x. The $187.5x refundable tax credit provided to FX is not a hybrid deduction because FX was subject to Country Z withholding tax of $300x on the $1,000x dividend (such withholding tax being greater than the $187.5x credit).
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. If instead FZ were allowed a $1,000x dividends paid deduction for the $1,000x dividend (and FX were not allowed the refundable tax credit) and the dividend were subject to 5% gross basis withholding tax (or $50x), then $750x of the dividends paid deduction would be a hybrid deduction, calculated as the excess of $1,000x (the dividends paid deduction) over $250x (the amount of income that under Country Z tax law would produce an amount of tax equal to the $50x of withholding tax, calculated as $50x, the amount of withholding tax, divided by 0.2, the Country Z corporate tax rate).
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

§ 1.246-1
Deductions not allowed for dividends from certain corporations.
The deductions provided in sections 243 (relating to dividends received by corporations), 244 (relating to dividends received on certain preferred stock), and 245 (relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations), are not allowable with respect to any dividend received from:
(a) A corporation organized under the China Trade Act, 1922 (15 U.S.C. ch. 4) (see section 941); or
(b) A corporation which is exempt from tax under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc., organizations) or section 521 (relating to farmers' cooperative associations) for the taxable year of the corporation in which the distribution is made or for its next preceding taxable year; for
(c) A corporation to which section 931 (relating to income from sources within possessions of the United States) applies for the taxable year of the corporation in which the distribution is made or for its next preceding taxable year; or
(d) A real estate investment trust which, for its taxable year in which the distribution is made, is taxable under Part II, Subchapter M, Chapter 1 of the Code. See section 243(c)(3), paragraph (c) of § 1.243-2, section 857(c), and paragraph (d) of § 1.857-6.

§ 1.246-2
Limitation on aggregate amount of deductions.
(a)
General rule.
The sum of the deductions allowed by sections 243(a)(1) (relating to dividends received by corporations), 244(a) (relating to dividends received on certain preferred stock), and 245 (relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations), except as provided in section 246(b)(2) and in paragraph (b) of this section, is limited to 85 percent of the taxable income of the corporation. The taxable income of the corporation for this purpose is computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172, the deduction for dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public utilities allowed by section 247, any capital loss carryback under section 1212(a)(1), and the deductions provided in sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245. For definition of the term
taxable income,
see section 63.
(b)
Effect of net operating loss.
If the shareholder corporation has a net operating loss (as determined under sec. 172) for a taxable year, the limitation provided in section 246(b)(1) and in paragraph (a) of this section is not applicable for such taxable year. In that event, the deductions provided in sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 shall be allowable for all tax purposes to the shareholder corporation for such taxable year without regard to such limitation. If the shareholder corporation does not have a net operating loss for
the taxable year, however, the limitation will be applicable for all tax purposes for such taxable year. In determining whether the shareholder corporation has a net operating loss for a taxable year under section 172, the deductions allowed by sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 are to be computed without regard to the limitation provided in section 246(b)(1) and in paragraph (a) of this section.
[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 825, Jan. 18, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7301, 39 FR 963, Jan. 4, 1974]
§ 1.246-3
Exclusion of certain dividends.
(a)
In general.
Corporate taxpayers are denied, in certain cases, the dividends-received deduction provided by section 243 (dividends received by corporations), section 244 (dividends received on certain preferred stock), and section 245 (dividends received from certain foreign corporations). The above-mentioned dividends-received deductions are denied, under section 246(c)(1), to corporate shareholders:
(1) If the dividend is in respect of any share of stock which is sold or otherwise disposed of in any case where the taxpayer has held such share for 15 days or less; or
(2) If and to the extent that the taxpayer is under an obligation to make corresponding payments with respect to substantially identical stock or securities. It is immaterial whether the obligation has arisen pursuant to a short sale or otherwise.
(b)
Ninety-day rule for certain preference dividends.
In the case of any stock having a preference in dividends, a special rule is provided by section 246(c)(2) in lieu of the 15-day rule described in section 246(c)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the taxpayer receives dividends on such stock which are attributable to a period or periods aggregating in excess of 366 days, the holding period specified in section 246(c)(1)(A) shall be 90 days (in lieu of 15 days).
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
“Otherwise disposed of”.
As used in this section the term
otherwise disposed of
includes disposal by gift.
(2)
“Substantially identical stock or securities”.
The term
substantially identical stock or securities
is to be applied according to the facts and circumstances in each case. In general, the term has the same meaning as the corresponding terms in sections 1091 and 1233 and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1233-1.
(3)
Obligation to make corresponding payments.
(i) Section 246(c)(1)(B) of the Code denies the dividends-received deduction to a corporate taxpayer to the extent that such taxpayer is under an obligation, with respect to substantially identical stock or securities, to make payments corresponding to the dividend received. Thus, for example, where a corporate taxpayer is in both a “long” and “short” position with respect to the same stock on the date that such stock goes ex-dividend, the dividend received on the stock owned by the taxpayer will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction to the extent that the taxpayer is obligated to make payments to cover the dividends with respect to its offsetting short position in the same stock. The dividends-received deduction is denied in such a case without regard to the length of time the taxpayer has held the stock on which such dividends are received.
(ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Y Corporation owns 100 shares of the Z Corporation's common stock on January 1, 1959. Z Corporation on January 15, 1959, declares a dividend of $1.00 per share payable to shareholders of record on January 30, 1959. On January 21, 1959, Y Corporation sells short 25 shares of the Z Corporation's common stock and remains in the short position on January 31, 1959, the day that Z Corporation's common stock goes ex-dividend. Y Corporation is therefore obligated to make a payment to the lender of the 25 shares of Z Corporation's common stock which were sold short, corresponding to the $1.00 a share dividend that the lender would have received on those 25 shares, or $25.00. Therefore, $25.00 of the $100.00 that the Y Corporation receives as dividends from the Z Corporation with respect to the 100 shares of common stock in which it has a long position is not eligible for the dividends-received deduction.
(d)
Determination of holding period
—(1)
In general.
Special rules are provided by paragraph (3) of section 246(c) for determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock for purposes of the restriction provided by
such section. In computing the holding period the day of disposition but not the day of acquisition shall be taken into account. Also, there shall not be taken into account any day which is more than 15 days after the date on which the share of stock becomes ex-dividend. Thus, the holding period is automatically terminated at the end of such 15-day period without regard to how long the stock may be held after that date. In the case of stock qualifying under paragraph (2) of section 246(c) (as having preference in dividends) a 90-day period is substituted for the 15-day period prescribed in this subparagraph. Finally, section 1223(4), relating to holding periods in the case of wash sales, shall not apply. Therefore, tacking of the holding period of the stock disposed of to the holding period of the stock acquired where a wash sale occurs is not permitted for purposes of determining the holding period described in section 246(c).
(2)
Special rules.
Section 246(c) requires that the holding periods determined thereunder shall be appropriately reduced for any period that the taxpayer's stock holding is offset by a corresponding short position resulting from an option to sell, a contractual obligation to sell, or a short sale of, substantially identical stock or securities. The holding periods of stock held for a period of 15 days or less on the date such short position is created shall accordingly be reduced to the extent of such short position. Where the amount of stock acquired within such period exceeds the amount as to which the taxpayer establishes a short position, the stock the holding period of which must be reduced because of such short position shall be that most recently acquired within such period. If, on the date the short position is created, the amount of stock subject to the short position exceeds the amount, if any, of stock held by the taxpayer for 15 days or less, the excess shares of stock sold short shall, to the extent thereof, postpone until the termination of the short position the commencement of the holding periods of subsequently acquired stock. Stock having a preference in dividends is also subject to the rules prescribed in this subparagraph, except that the 90-day period provided by paragraph (b) of this section shall apply in lieu of the 15-day period otherwise applicable. The rules prescribed in this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
L Company purchased 100 shares of Z Corporation's common stock during January 1959. On November 26, 1959, L Company purchased an additional 100 shares of the same stock. On December 1, 1959, Z Corporation declared a dividend payable on its common stock to shareholders of record on December 20, 1959. Also on December 1, L Company sold short 150 shares of Z Corporation's common stock. On December 16, 1959 (before the stock went ex-dividend), L Company closed its short sale with 150 shares purchased on that date. In determining, for purposes of section 246(c), whether L Company has held the 100 shares of stock acquired on November 26 for a period in excess of 15 days, the period of the short position (from December 2 through December 16) shall be excluded. Thus, if on or before December 26, 1959, L Company sold the 100 shares of Z Corporation stock which it purchased on November 26, 1959, it would not be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for the dividends received on such shares because it would have held such shares for 15 days or less on the date of the sale. Since L Company had held the 100 shares acquired during January 1959 for more than 15 days on December 2, 1959, and since it was under no obligation to make payments corresponding to the dividends received thereon, section 246(c) is inapplicable to the dividends received with respect to those shares.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
above except that the additional 100 shares of Z Corporation common stock were purchased by L Company on December 10, 1959, rather than November 26, 1959. In determining, for purposes of section 246(c), whether L Company has held such shares for a period in excess of 15 days, the period from December 11, 1959, until December 16, 1959 (the date the short sale made on December 1 was closed), shall be excluded.
(e)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section shall apply to stock acquired after December 31, 1957, or with respect to stock acquired before that date where the taxpayer has made a short sale of substantially identical stock or securities after that date.
§ 1.246-4
Dividends from a DISC or former DISC.
The deduction provided in section 243 (relating to dividends received by corporations) is not allowable with respect to any dividend (whether in the form of
a deemed or actual distribution or an amount treated as a dividend pursuant to section 995(c)) from a corporation which is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1) or (3) as the case may be) to the extent such dividend is from the corporation's accumulated DISC income (as defined in section 996(f)(1)) or previously taxed income (as defined in section 996(f)(2)) or is a deemed distribution pursuant to section 995(b)(1) in a taxable year for which the corporation qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. To the extent that a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits which are not made up of accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income, the corporate recipient is entitled to the deduction provided in section 243 in the same manner and to the same extent as a dividend from a domestic corporation which is not a DISC or former DISC.
[T.D. 7283, 38 FR 20824, Aug. 3, 1973]
§ 1.246-5
Reduction of holding periods in certain situations.
(a)
In general.
Under section 246(c)(4)(C), the holding period of stock for purposes of the dividends received deduction is appropriately reduced for any period in which a taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss by holding one or more other positions with respect to substantially similar or related property. This section provides rules for applying section 246(c)(4)(C).
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Substantially similar or related property.
The term substantially similar or related property is applied according to the facts and circumstances in each case. In general, property is substantially similar or related to stock when—
(i) The fair market values of the stock and the property primarily reflect the performance of—
(A) A single firm or enterprise;
(B) The same industry or industries; or
(C) The same economic factor or factors such as (but not limited to) interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign-currency exchange rates; and
(ii) Changes in the fair market value of the stock are reasonably expected to approximate, directly or inversely, changes in the fair market value of the property, a fraction of the fair market value of the property, or a multiple of the fair market value of the property.
(2)
Diminished risk of loss.
A taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss on its stock by holding positions with respect to substantially similar or related property if changes in the fair market values of the stock and the positions are reasonably expected to vary inversely.
(3)
Position.
For purposes of this section, a position with respect to property is an interest (including a futures or forward contract or an option) in property or any contractual right to a payment, whether or not severable from stock or other property. A position does not include traditional equity rights to demand payment from the issuer, such as the rights traditionally provided by mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.
(4)
Reasonable expectations.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(2), or (c)(1)(vi) of this section, reasonable expectations are the expectations of a reasonable person, based on all the facts and circumstances at the later of the time the stock is acquired or the positions are entered into. Reasonable expectations include all explicit or implicit representations made with respect to the marketing or sale of the position.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Positions in more than one stock
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(1) provides rules for the treatment of positions that reflect the value of more than one stock. In general, positions that reflect the value of a portfolio of stocks are treated under the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section, and positions that reflect the value of more than one stock but less than a portfolio are treated under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. A portfolio for this purpose is any group of stocks of 20 or more unrelated issuers. Paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section provides an anti-abuse rule.
(ii)
Portfolios.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a position reflecting the value of a portfolio of stocks is substantially similar or related to the stocks held by the taxpayer only if the position and the taxpayer's holdings substantially overlap as of the most recent testing date. A
position may be substantially similar or related to a taxpayer's entire stock holdings or a portion of a taxpayer's stock holdings.
(iii)
Determining substantial overlap.
This paragraph (c)(1)(iii) provides rules for determining whether a position and a taxpayer's stock holdings or a portion of a taxpayer's stock holdings substantially overlap. Paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) (A) through (C) of this section determine whether there is substantial overlap as of any testing date.
(A)
Step One.
Construct a subportfolio (the Subportfolio) that consists of stock in an amount equal to the lesser of the fair market value of each stock represented in the position and the fair market value of the stock in the taxpayer's stock holdings. (The Subportfolio may contain fewer than 20 stocks.)
(B)
Step Two.
If the fair market value of the Subportfolio is equal to or greater than 70 percent of the fair market value of the stocks represented in the position, the position and the Subportfolio substantially overlap.
(C)
Step Three.
If the position does not substantially overlap with the Subportfolio, repeat Steps One and Two (paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section) reducing the size of the position. The largest percentage of the position that results in a substantial overlap is substantially similar or related to the Subportfolio determined with respect to that percentage of the position.
(iv)
Testing date.
A testing date is any day on which the taxpayer purchases or sells any stock if the fair market value of the stock or the fair market value of substantially similar or related property is reflected in the position, any day on which the taxpayer changes the position, or any day on which the composition of the position changes.
(v)
Nonportfolio positions.
A position that reflects the fair market value of more than one stock but not of a portfolio of stocks is treated as a separate position with respect to each of the stocks the value of which the position reflects.
(vi)
Anti-abuse rule.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, a position that reflects the value of more than one stock is a position in substantially similar or related property to the appropriate portion of the taxpayer's stock holdings if—
(A) Changes in the value of the position or the stocks reflected in the position are reasonably expected to virtually track (directly or inversely) changes in the value of the taxpayer's stock holdings, or any portion of the taxpayer's stock holdings and other positions of the taxpayer; and
(B) The position is acquired or held as part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to obtain tax savings (including by deferring tax) the value of which is significantly in excess of the expected pre-tax economic profits from the plan.
(2)
Options
—(i)
Options that are significantly out of the money.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an option to sell that is significantly out of the money does not diminish the taxpayer's risk of loss on its stock unless the option is held as part of a strategy to substantially offset changes in the fair market value of the stock.
(ii)
Conversion rights.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, a taxpayer is treated as diminishing its risk of loss by holding substantially similar or related property if it engages in the following transactions or their substantial equivalents—
(A) A short sale of common stock while holding convertible preferred stock of the same issuer and the price changes of the convertible preferred stock and the common stock are related;
(B) A short sale of a convertible debenture while holding convertible preferred stock into which the debenture is convertible or common stock; or
(C) A short sale of convertible preferred stock while holding common stock.
(3)
Stacking rule.
If a taxpayer diminishes its risk of loss by holding a position in substantially similar or related property with respect to only a portion of the shares that the taxpayer holds in a particular stock, the holding period of those shares having the shortest holding period is reduced.
(4)
Guarantees, surety agreements, or similar arrangements.
A taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss on stock by holding a position in substantially similar or related property if the taxpayer is the beneficiary of a guarantee, surety agreement, or similar arrangement and the guarantee, surety agreement, or similar arrangement provides for payments that will substantially offset decreases in the fair market value of the stock.
(5)
Hedges counted only once.
A position established as a hedge of one outstanding position, transaction, or obligation of the taxpayer (other than stock) is not treated as diminishing the risk of loss with respect to any other position held by the taxpayer. In determining whether a position is established to hedge an outstanding position, transaction, or obligation of the taxpayer, substantial deference will be given to the relationships that are established in its books and records at the time the position is entered into.
(6)
Use of related persons or pass-through entities.
Positions held by a party related to the taxpayer within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1) are treated as positions held by the taxpayer if the positions are held with a view to avoiding the application of this section or § 1.1092(d)-2. In addition, a taxpayer is treated as diminishing its risk of loss by holding substantially similar or related property if the taxpayer holds an interest in, or is the beneficiary of, a pass-through entity, intermediary, or other arrangement with a view to avoiding the application of this section or § 1.1092(d)-2.
(7)
Notional principal contracts.
For purposes of this section, rights and obligations under notional principal contracts are considered separately even though payments with regard to those rights and obligations are generally netted for other purposes. Therefore, if a taxpayer is treated under the preceding sentence as receiving payments under a notional principal contract when the fair market value of the taxpayer's stock declines, the taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss by holding a position in substantially similar or related property regardless of the netting of the payments under the contract for any other purposes.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1.
General application to common stock. Corporation A and Corporation B are both automobile manufacturers. The fair market values of Corporation A and Corporation B common stock primarily reflect the value of the same industry. Because Corporation A and Corporation B common stock are affected not only by the general level of growth in the industry but also by individual corporate management decisions and corporate capital structures, changes in the fair market value of Corporation A common stock are not reasonably expected to approximate changes in the fair market value of the Corporation B common stock. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Corporation A common stock is not substantially similar or related to Corporation B common stock.

# Example 2. Common stock value primarily reflects commodity price.
Corporation C and Corporation D both hold gold as their primary asset, and historically changes in the fair market value of Corporation C common stock approximated changes in the fair market value of Corporation D common stock. Corporation M purchased Corporation C common stock and sold short Corporation D common stock. Corporation C common stock is substantially similar or related to Corporation D common stock because their fair market values primarily reflect the performance of the same economic factor, the price of gold, and changes in the fair market value of Corporation C common stock are reasonably expected to approximate changes in the fair market value of Corporation D common stock. It was reasonably expected that changes in the fair market values of the Corporation C common stock and the short position in Corporation D common stock would vary inversely. Thus, Corporation M has diminished its risk of loss on its Corporation C common stock for purposes of section 246(c)(4)(C) and this section by holding a position in substantially similar or related property.

# Example 3. Portfolios of stocks.
(i) Corporation Z holds a portfolio of stocks and acquires a short position on a publicly traded index through a regulated futures contract (RFC) that reflects the value of a portfolio of stocks as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. The index reflects the fair market value of stocks A through T. The values of stocks reflected in the index and the values of the same stocks in Corporation Z's holdings are as follows:

(ii) The position is substantially similar or related to Z's stock holdings only if they substantially overlap. To determine whether they substantially overlap, Corporation Z must construct a Subportfolio of stocks with the lesser of the value of the stock as reflected in the RFC and its holdings. The Subportfolio is given in the rightmost column above. The value of the Subportfolio is 60.74 percent of the value of the stocks represented in the position ($4100 ÷ $6750), so the position and the Subportfolio do not substantially overlap.
(iii) To determine whether any portion of the position substantially overlaps with any portion of the Z's stock holdings, the values of the stocks in the RFC are reduced for purposes of the above steps. Eighty percent of the position and the corresponding subportfolio (consisting of stocks with a value of the lesser of the stocks represented in Z's holdings and in 80 percent of the RFC) substantially overlap, computed as follows:

(iv) Because $3,780 is 70 percent of $5,400, the Subportfolio substantially overlaps with 80 percent of the position. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, Z's stocks having the shortest holding period are treated as included in the Subportfolio. A larger portion of Z's stocks may be treated as substantially similar or related property under the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.

# Example 4. Hedges counted only once.
January 1, 1996, Corporation X owns a $100 million portfolio of stocks all of which would substantially overlap with a $100 million regulated futures contract (RFC) on a commonly used index (the Index). On January 15, Corporation X enters into a $100 million short position in an RFC on the Index with a March delivery date and enters into a $75 million long position in an RFC on the Index for June delivery. Also on January 15, 1996, Corporation X indicates in its books and records that the long and short RFC positions are intended to offset one another. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, $75 million of the short position in the RFC is not treated as diminishing the risk of loss on the stock portfolio and instead is treated as a straddle or a hedging transaction, as appropriate, with respect to the $75 million long position in the RFC, under section 1092. The remaining $25 million short position is treated as diminishing the risk of loss on the portfolio by holding a position in substantially similar or related property. The rules of paragraph (c)(1) determine how much of the portfolio is subject to this rule and the rules of paragraph (c)(3) determine which shares have their holding periods tolled.
(e)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply to dividends received on or after March 17, 1995, on stock acquired after July 18, 1984.
(2)
Special rule for dividends received on certain stock.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, this section applies to any dividends received by a taxpayer on stock acquired after July 18, 1984, if the taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss by holding substantially similar or related property involving the following types of transactions—
(i) The short sale of common stock when holding convertible preferred stock of the same issuer and the price changes of the two stocks are related,
or the short sale of a convertible debenture while holding convertible preferred stock into which the debenture is convertible (or common stock), or a short sale of convertible preferred stock while holding common stock; or
(ii) The acquisition of a short position in a regulated futures contract on a stock index, or the acquisition of an option to sell the regulated futures contract or the stock index itself, or the grant of a deep-in-the-money option to buy the regulated futures contract or the stock index while holding the stock of an investment company whose principal holdings mimic the performance of the stocks included in the stock index; or alternatively, while holding a portfolio composed of stocks that mimic the performance of the stocks included in the stock index.
[T.D. 8590, 60 FR 14638, Mar. 20, 1995]
§ 1.247-1
Deduction for dividends paid on preferred stock of public utilities.
(a)
Amount of deduction.
(1) A deduction is provided in section 247 for dividends paid during the taxable year by certain public utility corporations (see paragraph (b) of this section) on certain preferred stock (see paragraph (c) of this section). This deduction is an amount equal to the product of a specified fraction times the lesser of (i) the amount of the dividends paid during the taxable year by a public utility on its preferred stock (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), or (ii) the taxable income of the public utility for such taxable year (computed without regard to the deduction allowed by section 247). The specified fraction for any taxable year is the fraction the numerator of which is 14 and the denominator of which is the sum of the corporation normal tax rate and the surtax rate for such taxable year specified in section 11. Since section 11 provides that for the calendar year 1954 the corporation normal tax rate is 30 percent and the surtax rate is 22 percent, the sum of the two tax rates is 52 percent and the specified fraction for the calendar year 1954 is 14/52. If, for example, section 11 should specify that the corporation's normal tax rate is 25 percent and the surtax rate is 22 percent for the calendar year, the sum of the two tax rates will be 47 percent and the specified fraction for the calendar year will be 14/47. If Corporation A, a public utility which files its income tax return on the calendar year basis, pays $100,000 dividends on its preferred stock in the calendar year 1954 and if its taxable income for such year is greater than $100,000 the deduction allowable to Corporation A under section 247 for 1954 is $100,000 times 14/52, or $26,923.08. If in 1954 Corporation A's taxable income, computed without regard to the deduction provided in section 247, had been $90,000 (that is, less than the amount of the dividends which it paid on its preferred stock in that year), the deduction allowable under section 247 for 1954 would have been $90,000 times 14/52, or $24,230.77.
(2) For the purpose of determining the amount of the deduction provided in section 247(a) and in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amount of dividends paid in a given taxable year shall not include any amount distributed in such year with respect to dividends unpaid and accumulated in any taxable year ending before October 1, 1942. If any distribution is made in the current taxable year with respect to dividends unpaid and accumulated for a prior taxable year, such distribution will be deemed to have been made with respect to the earliest year or years for which there are dividends unpaid and accumulated. Thus, if a public utility makes a distribution with respect to a prior taxable year, it shall be considered that such distribution was made with respect to the earliest year or years for which there are dividends unpaid and accumulated, whether or not the public utility states that the distribution was made with respect to such year or years and even though the public utility stated that the distribution was made with respect to a later year. Even though it has dividends unpaid and accumulated with respect to a taxable year ending before October 1, 1942, a public utility may, however, include the dividends paid with respect to the current taxable year in computing the deduction under section 247. If there are no dividends unpaid and accumulated with respect to a taxable year ending before October 1, 1942, a
public utility may include the dividends paid with respect to a prior taxable year which ended after October 1, 1942, in computing the deduction under section 247; such public utility in addition may include the dividends paid with respect to the current taxable year in computing the deduction under section 247. However, if local law or its own charter requires a public utility to pay all unpaid and accumulated dividends before any dividends can be paid with respect to the current taxable year, such public utility may not include any distribution in the current year in computing the deduction under section 247 to the extent that there are dividends unpaid and accumulated with respect to taxable years ending before October 1, 1942.
(3) If a corporation which is engaged in one or more of the four types of business activities (called utility activities in this section) enumerated in section 247(b)(1) (the furnishing of telephone service or the sale of electrical energy, gas, or water) is also engaged in some other business that does not fall within any of the enumerated categories, the deduction under section 247 is allowable only for such portion of the amount computed under section 247(a) as is allocable to the income from utility activities. For this purpose, the allocation may be made on the basis of the ratio which the total income from the utility activities bears to total income from all sources (total income being considered either gross income or gross receipts, whichever method results in the higher deduction). However, if such an allocation reaches an inequitable result and the books of the corporation are so kept that the taxable income attributable to the utility activities can be readily determined, particularly where the books of the corporation are required by governmental bodies to be so kept for rate making or other purposes, the allocation may be made upon the basis of taxable income. No such apportionment will be required if the income from sources other than utility activities is less than 20 percent of the total income of the corporation, irrespective of the method used in determining such total income.
(b)
Public utility.
As used in section 247 and this section, public utility means a corporation engaged in the furnishing of telephone service, or in the sale of electric energy, gas, or water if the rates charged by such corporation for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of the United States or by a public utility or public service commission or other similar body of the District of Columbia or of any State or political subdivision thereof. If a schedule of rates has been filed with any of the above bodies having the power to disapprove such rates, then such rates shall be considered as established or approved rates even though such body has taken no action on the filed schedule. Rates fixed by contract between the corporation and the purchaser, except where the purchaser is the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or an agency or political subdivision of the United States, a State, or the District of Columbia, shall not be considered as established or approved rates in those cases where they are not subject to direct control, or where no maximum rate for such contract rates has been established by the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or by an agency or political subdivision thereof. The deduction provided in section 247 will not be denied solely because part of the gross income of the corporation consists of revenue derived from such furnishing or sale at rates which are not so regulated, provided the corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (1) that the revenue from regulated rates and the revenue from unregulated rates are derived from the operation of a single interconnected and coordinated system within a single area or region in one or more States, or from the operation of more than one such system and (2) that the regulation to which it is subject in part of its operating territory in one such system is effective to control rates within the unregulated territory of the same system so that the rates within the unregulated territory have been and are substantially as favorable
to users and consumers as are the rates within the regulated territory.
(c)
Preferred stock.
(1) For the purposes of section 247 and this section, preferred stock means stock (i) which was issued before October 1, 1942, (ii) the dividends in respect of which (during the whole of the taxable year, or the part of the taxable year after the actual date of the issue of such stock) were cumulative, nonparticipating as to current distributions, and payable in preference to the payment of dividends on other stock, and (iii) the rate of return on which is fixed and cannot be changed by a vote of the board of directors or by some similar method. However, if there are several classes of preferred stock, all of which meet the above requirements, the deduction provided in section 247 shall not be denied in the case of a given class of preferred stock merely because there is another class of preferred stock whose dividends are to be paid before those of the given class of stock. Likewise, it is immaterial for the purposes of section 247 and this section whether the stock be voting or nonvoting stock.
(2) Preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, under certain circumstances will be considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, for purposes of the deduction provided in section 247. If the new stock is issued on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or replace bonds or debentures which were issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other stock which was preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), such new stock shall be considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942. If preferred stock is issued to refund or replace stock which was preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), it shall be immaterial whether the preferred stock so refunded or replaced was issued before, on, or after October 1, 1942. If stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or replace stock which was issued before October 1, 1942, and which was preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), is not itself preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), no stock issued to refund or replace such stock can be considered preferred stock for purposes of the deduction provided in section 247.
(3) In the case of any preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other stock which was preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), only that portion of the stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, will be considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, the par or stated value of which does not exceed the par, stated, or face value of such bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock which the new stock was issued to refund or replace. In such case no shares of the new stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, shall be earmarked in determining the deduction allowable under section 247, but the appropriate allocable portion of the total amount of dividends paid on such stock will be considered as having been paid on stock which was issued before October 1, 1942.
(4) The provisions of section 247(b)(2) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A public utility has outstanding 1,000 bonds which were issued before October 1, 1942, and each of which has a face value of $100. On or after October 1, 1942, each of such bonds is retired in exchange for 1
1/10
shares of preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, and having a par value of $100 per share. Only
10/11
of the dividends paid on the preferred stock thus issued in exchange for the bonds will be considered as having been paid on stock which was issued before October 1, 1942. Likewise, if preferred stock which is issued on or after October 1, 1942, has no par value but a stated value of $50 per share and such stock is issued in a ratio of three shares to one share to refund or replace preferred stock having a par value of $100 per share, only two-thirds of the dividends paid on the new shares of stock will be considered as having been paid on stock which was issued before October 1, 1942.
(5) Whether or not preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, was
issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock, is in each case a question of fact. Among the factors to be considered is whether such stock is new in an economic sense to the corporation or whether it was issued merely to take the place, directly or indirectly, of bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of such corporation. It is not necessary that the new preferred stock be issued in exchange for such bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock. The mere fact that the bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock remain in existence for a short period of time after the issuance of the new stock (or were retired before the issuance of the new stock) does not necessarily mean that such new stock was not issued to refund or replace such bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock. It is necessary to consider the entire transaction, including the issuance of the new preferred stock, the date of such issuance, the retirement of the old bonds, debentures, or preferred stock, and the date of such retirement, in order to determine whether such new stock really was issued to take the place of bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of the corporation or whether it represents something essentially new in an economic sense in the corporation's financial structure. If, for example, a public utility, which has outstanding bonds issued before October 1, 1942, issues new preferred stock on October 1, 1954, in order to secure funds with which to retire such bonds and with the money paid in for such stock retires the bonds on November 1, 1954, such stock may be considered as having been issued to refund or replace bonds issued before October 1, 1942. Whether the money used to retire the bonds can be traced back and identified as the money paid in for the stock will have evidentiary value, but will not be conclusive, in determining whether the stock was issued to refund or replace the bonds. Similarly, whether the amount of money used to retire the bonds was smaller than, equal to, or greater than that paid in for the stock, or whether the entire issue of bonds is retired, will be important, but not decisive, in making such determination.
(6) Preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, by a corporation to refund or replace bonds or debentures of a second corporation which were issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock of such second corporation, may be considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, if such new stock was issued (i) in a transaction which is a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939; or (ii) in a transaction to which section 371 (relating to insolvency reorganizations), or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, is applicable; or (iii) in a transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI, Subchapter O, Chapter 1 of the Code (relating to exchanges and distributions in obedience to orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or to the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Whether the stock actually was issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures of the second corporation issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace preferred stock of such second corporation, shall be determined under the same principles as if only one corporation were involved. A corporation may issue stock to refund or replace its own bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock in a transaction which is a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, in a transaction to which section 371 or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, or in a transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI, Subchapter O, Chapter 1 of the Code, or to the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The provisions of this paragraph, in addition, are applicable in case a corporation issues stock on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or replace its own bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock even though the issuance of such stock may not fall within one of the categories enumerated above.
(7) Even though stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, is considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, by reason of having been issued to
refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock, such stock will not be deemed to be preferred stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2), and no deduction will be allowable in respect of dividends paid on such stock, unless the stock fulfills all the other requirements of a preferred stock set forth in section 247(b)(2) and in this paragraph.
§ 1.248-1
Election to amortize organizational expenditures.
(a)
In general.
Under section 248(a), a corporation may elect to amortize organizational expenditures as defined in section 248(b) and § 1.248-1(b). In the taxable year in which a corporation begins business, an electing corporation may deduct an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the organizational expenditures of the corporation, or $5,000 (reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the organizational expenditures exceed $50,000). The remainder of the organizational expenditures is deducted ratably over the 180-month period beginning with the month in which the corporation begins business. All organizational expenditures of the corporation are considered in determining whether the organizational expenditures exceed $50,000, including expenditures incurred on or before October 22, 2004.
(b)
Organizational expenditures defined.
(1) Section 248(b) defines the term
organizational expenditures.
Such expenditures, for purposes of section 248 and this section, are those expenditures which are directly incident to the creation of the corporation. An expenditure, in order to qualify as an organizational expenditure, must be (i) incident to the creation of the corporation, (ii) chargeable to the capital account of the corporation, and (iii) of a character which, if expended incident to the creation of a corporation having a limited life, would be amortizable over such life. An expenditure which fails to meet each of these three tests may not be considered an organizational expenditure for purposes of section 248 and this section.
(2) The following are examples of organizational expenditures within the meaning of section 248 and this section: legal services incident to the organization of the corporation, such as drafting the corporate charter, by-laws, minutes of organizational meetings, terms of original stock certificates, and the like; necessary accounting services; expenses of temporary directors and of organizational meetings of directors or stockholders; and fees paid to the State of incorporation.
(3) The following expenditures are not organizational expenditures within the meaning of section 248 and this section:
(i) Expenditures connected with issuing or selling shares of stock or other securities, such as commissions, professional fees, and printing costs. This is so even where the particular issue of stock to which the expenditures relate is for a fixed term of years;
(ii) Expenditures connected with the transfer of assets to a corporation.
(4) Expenditures connected with the reorganization of a corporation, unless directly incident to the creation of a corporation, are not organizational expenditures within the meaning of section 248 and this section.
(c)
Time and manner of making election.
A corporation is deemed to have made an election under section 248(a) to amortize organizational expenditures as defined in section 248(b) and § 1.248-1(b) for the taxable year in which the corporation begins business. A corporation may choose to forgo the deemed election by affirmatively electing to capitalize its organizational expenditures on a timely filed Federal income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which the corporation begins business. The election either to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) or to capitalize organizational expenditures is irrevocable and applies to all organizational expenditures of the corporation. A change in the characterization of an item as an organizational expenditure is a change in method of accounting to which sections 446 and 481(a) apply if the corporation treated the item consistently for two or more taxable years. A change in the determination of the taxable year in which the corporation begins business also is treated as a change in method of accounting if the corporation amortized
organizational expenditures for two or more taxable years.
(d)
Determination of when corporation begins business.
The deduction allowed under section 248 must be spread over a period beginning with the month in which the corporation begins business. The determination of the date the corporation begins business presents a question of fact which must be determined in each case in light of all the circumstances of the particular case. The words “begins business,” however, do not have the same meaning as “in existence.” Ordinarily, a corporation begins business when it starts the business operations for which it was organized; a corporation comes into existence on the date of its incorporation. Mere organizational activities, such as the obtaining of the corporate charter, are not alone sufficient to show the beginning of business. If the activities of the corporation have advanced to the extent necessary to establish the nature of its business operations, however, it will be deemed to have begun business. For example, the acquisition of operating assets which are necessary to the type of business contemplated may constitute the beginning of business.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1. Expenditures of $5,000 or less
Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, incurs $3,000 of organizational expenditures after October 22, 2004, and begins business on July 1, 2011. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct the entire amount of the organizational expenditures in 2011, the taxable year in which Corporation X begins business.

# Example 2. Expenditures of more than $5,000 but less than or equal to $50,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs organizational expenditures of $41,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct $5,000 and the portion of the remaining $36,000 that is allocable to July through December of 2011 ($36,000/180 × 6 = $1,200) in 2011, the taxable year in which Corporation X begins business. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $34,800 ($36,000 − $1,200 = $34,800) ratably over the remaining 174 months.

# Example 3. Subsequent change in the characterization of an item
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that Corporation X determines in 2013 that Corporation X incurred $10,000 for an additional organizational expenditure erroneously deducted in 2011 under section 162 as a business expense. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2011, including the additional $10,000 of organizational expenditures. Corporation X is using an impermissible method of accounting for the additional $10,000 of organizational expenditures and must change its method under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable general administrative procedures in effect in 2013.

# Example 4. Subsequent redetermination of year in which business begins
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that, in 2012, Corporation X deducted the organizational expenditures allocable to January through December of 2012 ($36,000/180 × 12 = $2,400). In addition, in 2013 it is determined that Corporation X actually began business in 2012. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2012. Corporation X impermissibly deducted organizational expenditures in 2011, and incorrectly determined the amount of organizational expenditures deducted in 2012. Therefore, Corporation X is using an impermissible method of accounting for the organizational expenditures and must change its method under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable general administrative procedures in effect in 2013.

# Example 5. Expenditures of more than $50,000 but less than or equal to $55,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs organizational expenditures of $54,500. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct $500 ($5,000 − $4,500) and the portion of the remaining $54,000 that is allocable to July through December of 2011 ($54,000/180 × 6 = $1,800) in 2011, the taxable year in which Corporation X begins business. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $52,200 ($54,000 − $1,800 = $52,200) ratably over the remaining 174 months.

# Example 6. Expenditures of more than $55,000
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that Corporation X incurs organizational expenditures of $450,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X is deemed to have elected to amortize organizational expenditures under section 248(a) in 2011. Therefore, Corporation X may deduct the amounts allocable to July through December of 2011 ($450,000/180 × 6 = $15,000) in 2011, the taxable year in which Corporation X begins
business. Corporation X may amortize the remaining $435,000 ($450,000 − $15,000 = $435,000) ratably over the remaining 174 months.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to organizational expenditures paid or incurred after August 16, 2011. However, taxpayers may apply all the provisions of this section to organizational expenditures paid or incurred after October 22, 2004, provided that the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the year the election under paragraph (c) of this section is deemed made has not expired. For organizational expenditures paid or incurred on or before September 8, 2008, taxpayers may instead apply § 1.248-1, as in effect prior to that date (§ 1.248-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2008).
[T.D. 9411, 73 FR 38913, July 8, 2008, as amended by T.D. 9542, 76 FR 50889, Aug. 17, 2011]
§ 1.249-1
Limitation on deduction of bond premium on repurchase.
(a)
Limitation
—(1)
General rule.
No deduction is allowed to the issuing corporation for any “repurchase premium” paid or incurred to repurchase a convertible obligation to the extent the repurchase premium exceeds a “normal call premium.”
(2)
Exception.
Under paragraph (e) of this section, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent the corporation demonstrates that such excess is attributable to the cost of borrowing and not to the conversion feature.
(b)
Obligations
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, the term
obligation
means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness.
(2)
Convertible obligation.
Section 249 applies to an obligation which is convertible into the stock of the issuing corporation or a corporation which, at the time the obligation is issued or repurchased, is in control of or controlled by the issuing corporation. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
control
has the meaning assigned to such term by section 368(c).
(3)
Comparable nonconvertible obligation.
A nonconvertible obligation is comparable to a convertible obligation if both obligations are of the same grade and classification, with the same issue and maturity dates, and bearing the same rate of interest. The term
comparable nonconvertible obligation
does not include any obligation which is convertible into property.
(c)
Repurchase premium.
For purposes of this section, the term
repurchase premium
means the excess of the repurchase price paid or incurred to repurchase the obligation over its adjusted issue price (within the meaning of § 1.1275-1(b)) as of the repurchase date. For the general rules applicable to the deductibility of repurchase premium, see § 1.163-7(c). This paragraph (c) applies to convertible obligations repurchased on or after March 2, 1998.
(d)
Normal call premium
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, for purposes of this section, a
normal call premium
on a convertible obligation is an amount equal to a normal call premium on a nonconvertible obligation which is comparable to the convertible obligation. A normal call premium on a comparable nonconvertible obligation is a call premium specified in dollars under the terms of such obligation. Thus, if such a specified call premium is constant over the entire term of the obligation, the normal call premium is the amount specified. If, however, the specified call premium varies during the period the comparable nonconvertible obligation is callable or if such obligation is not callable over its entire term, the normal call premium is the amount specified for the period during the term of such comparable nonconvertible obligation which corresponds to the period during which the convertible obligation was repurchased.
(2)
One-year's interest rule.
For a convertible obligation repurchased on or after March 2, 1998, a call premium specified in dollars under the terms of the obligation is considered to be a normal call premium on a nonconvertible obligation if the call premium applicable when the obligation is repurchased does not exceed an amount equal to the interest (including original issue discount) that otherwise would be deductible for the taxable year of repurchase (determined as if the obligation were not repurchased). The provisions of this subparagraph
shall not apply if the amount of interest payable for the corporation's taxable year is subject under the terms of the obligation to any contingency other than repurchase prior to the close of such taxable year.
(e)
Exception
—(1)
In general.
If a repurchase premium exceeds a normal call premium, the general rule of paragraph (a) (1) of this section does not apply to the extent that the corporation demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate that such repurchase premium is attributable to the cost of borrowing and is not attributable to the conversion feature. For purposes of this paragraph, if a normal call premium cannot be established under paragraph (d) of this section, the amount thereof shall be considered to be zero.
(2)
Determination of the portion of a repurchase premium attributable to the cost of borrowing and not attributable to the conversion feature.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the portion of a repurchase premium which is attributable to the cost of borrowing and which is not attributable to the conversion feature is the amount by which the selling price of the convertible obligation increased between the dates it was issued and repurchased by reason of a decline in yields on comparable nonconvertible obligations traded on an established securities market or, if such comparable traded obligations do not exist, by reason of a decline in yields generally on nonconvertible obligations which are as nearly comparable as possible.
(ii) In determining the amount under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, appropriate consideration shall be given to all factors affecting the selling price or yields of comparable nonconvertible obligations. Such factors include general changes in prevailing yields of comparable obligations between the dates the convertible obligation was issued and repurchased and the amount (if any) by which the selling price of the nonconvertible obligation was affected by reason of any change in the issuing corporation's credit quality or the credit quality of the obligation during such period (determined on the basis of widely published financial information or on the basis of other relevant facts and circumstances which reflect the relative credit quality of the corporation or the comparable obligation).
(iii) The relationship between selling price and yields in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall ordinarily be determined by means of standard bond tables.
(f)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Under section 414(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the provisions of section 249 and this section shall apply to any repurchase of a convertible obligation occurring after April 22, 1969, other than a convertible obligation repurchased pursuant to a binding obligation incurred on or before April 22, 1969, to repurchase such convertible obligation at a specified call premium. A binding obligation on or before such date may arise if, for example, the issuer irrevocably obligates itself, on or before such date, to repurchase the convertible obligation at a specified price after such date, or if, for example, the issuer, without regard to the terms of the convertible obligation, negotiates a contract which, on or before such date, irrevocably obligates the issuer to repurchase the convertible obligation at a specified price after such date. A binding obligation on or before such date does not include a privilege in the convertible obligation permitting the issuer to call such convertible obligation after such date, which privilege was not exercised on or before such date.
(2)
Effect on transactions not subject to this section.
No inferences shall be drawn from the provisions of section 249 and this section as to the proper treatment of transactions not subject to such provisions because of the effective date limitations thereof. For provisions relating to repurchases of convertible bonds or other evidences of indebtedness to which section 249 and this section do not apply, see §§ 1.163-3(c) and 1.163-4(c).
(3)
Portion of repurchase premium attributable to cost of borrowing.
Paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section applies to any repurchase of a convertible obligation occurring on or after July 6, 2011.
(g)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On May 15, 1968, corporation A issues a callable 20-year convertible bond at face for $1,000 bearing interest at 10 percent per annum. The bond is convertible at any time into 2 shares of the common stock of corporation A. Under the terms of the bond, the applicable call price prior to May 15, 1975, is $1,100. On June 1, 1974, corporation A calls the bond for $1,100. Since the repurchase premium, $100 (i.e., $1,100 minus $1,000), was specified in dollars in the obligation and does not exceed 1 year's interest at the rate fixed in the obligation, the $100 is considered under paragraph (d) (2) of this section to be a normal call premium on a comparable nonconvertible obligation. Accordingly, A may deduct the $100 under § 1.163-3(c).

(A) Its global intangible low-taxed income for the year; and
(B) The amount treated as a dividend received by the corporation under section 78 which is attributable to its GILTI for the year.
(2)
Taxable income limitation.
In the case of a domestic corporation with a section 250(a)(2) amount for a taxable year, for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the year—
(i) The corporation's FDII for the year (if any) is reduced (but not below zero) by an amount that bears the same ratio to the corporation's section 250(a)(2) amount that the corporation's FDII for the year bears to the sum of the corporation's FDII and GILTI for the year; and
(ii) The corporation's GILTI for the year (if any) is reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of the corporation's section 250(a)(2) amount over the amount of the reduction described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Reduction in deduction for taxable years after 2025.
For any taxable year of a domestic corporation beginning after December 31, 2025, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies by substituting—

Returns on Form 8993 (or any successor form) for a taxable year must be filed with the domestic corporation's (or in the case of a section 962 election, the individual's) income tax return on or before the due date (taking into account extensions) for filing the corporation's (or in the case of a section 962 election, the individual's) income tax return.
(e)
Determination of deduction for consolidated groups.
A member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) determines its deduction under section 250(a) and this section under the rules provided in § 1.1502-50(b).
(f)
Example: Application of the taxable income limitation.
The following example illustrates the application of this section. For purposes of the example, it is assumed that DC is a domestic corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group and the taxable year of DC begins after 2017 and before 2026.
(1)
Facts.
For the taxable year, without regard to section 250(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, DC has FDII of $100x and GILTI of $300x. DC's taxable income (without regard to section 250(a) and this section) is $300x.
(2)
Analysis.
DC has a section 250(a)(2) amount of $100x, which is equal to the excess of the sum of DC's FDII and GILTI of $400x ($100x + $300x) over its taxable income of $300x. As a result, DC's FDII and GILTI are reduced, in the aggregate, by $100x under section 250(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for purposes of calculating DC's deduction allowed under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. DC's FDII is reduced by $25x, the amount that bears the same ratio to the section 250(a)(2) amount ($100x) as DC's FDII ($100x) bears to the sum of DC's FDII and GILTI ($400x). DC's GILTI is reduced by $75x, which is the remainder of the section 250(a)(2) amount ($100x−$25x). Therefore, for purposes of calculating its deduction under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, DC's FDII is $75x ($100x−$25x) and its GILTI is $225x ($300x−$75x). Accordingly, DC is allowed a deduction for the taxable year under section 250(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $140.63x ($75x × 0.375 + $225x × 0.50).

Cost of goods sold must be attributed to gross receipts with respect to gross DEI or gross FDDEI regardless of whether certain costs included in cost of goods sold can be associated with activities undertaken in an earlier taxable year (including a year before the effective date of section 250). A domestic corporation or partnership may not segregate cost of goods sold with respect to a particular product into component costs and attribute those component costs disproportionately to gross receipts with respect to amounts excluded from gross DEI or gross FDDEI, as applicable.
(2)
Deductions properly allocable to gross DEI and gross FDDEI
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining a domestic corporation's deductions that are properly allocable to gross DEI and gross FDDEI, the corporation's deductions are allocated and apportioned to gross DEI and gross FDDEI under the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17 by treating section 250(b) as an operative section described in § 1.861-8(f). In allocating and apportioning deductions under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17, gross FDDEI and gross RDEI are treated as separate statutory groupings. The deductions allocated and apportioned to gross DEI equal the sum of the deductions allocated and apportioned to gross FDDEI and gross RDEI. All items of gross income described in paragraphs (c)(15)(i) through (vi) of this section are in the residual grouping.
(ii)
Determination of deductions to allocate.
For purposes of determining the deductions of a domestic corporation for a taxable year properly allocable to gross DEI and gross FDDEI, the deductions of the corporation for the taxable year are determined without regard to sections 163(j), 170(b)(2), 172, 246(b), and 250.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d).
(i)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(A) DC is a domestic corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group.
(B) All sales and services are provided to persons that are not related parties.
(C) All sales and services to foreign persons qualify as FDDEI transactions.

Facts.
For a taxable year, DC manufactures products A and B in the United States. DC sells products A and B and provides services associated with products A and B to United States and foreign persons. DC's QBAI for the taxable year is $1,000x. DC has $300x of deductible interest expense allowed under section 163. DC has assets with a tax book value of $2,500x. The tax book value of DC's assets used to produce products A and B and services is split evenly between assets that produce gross FDDEI and assets that produce gross RDEI. DC has $840x of supportive deductions, as defined in § 1.861-8(b)(3), attributable to general and administrative expenses incurred for the purpose of generating the class of gross income that consists of gross DEI. DC apportions the $840x of deductions on the basis of gross income in accordance with § 1.861-8T(c)(1). For purposes of determining gross FDDEI and gross DEI under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, DC attributes $200x of cost of goods sold to Product A and $400x of cost of goods sold to Product B, and then attributes the cost of goods sold for each product ratably between the gross receipts of such product sold to foreign persons and the gross receipts of such product sold to United States persons. The manner in which DC attributes the cost of goods sold is a reasonable method. DC has no other items of income, loss, or deduction. For the taxable year, DC has the following income tax items relevant to the determination of its FDII:

Determination of gross FDDEI and gross RDEI.
Because DC does not have any income described in section 250(b)(3)(A)(i)(I) through (VI) and paragraphs (c)(15)(i) through (vi) of this section, none of its gross income is excluded from gross DEI. DC's gross DEI is $1,600x ($2,200x total gross receipts less $600x total cost of goods sold). DC's gross FDDEI is $800x ($1,100x of gross receipts from foreign persons minus attributable cost of goods sold of $300x).
(
ii
)
Determination of foreign-derived deduction eligible income.
To calculate its FDDEI, DC must determine the amount of its deductions that are allocated and apportioned to gross FDDEI and then subtract those amounts from gross FDDEI. DC's interest deduction of $300x is allocated and apportioned to gross FDDEI on the basis of the average total value of DC's assets in each grouping. DC has assets with a tax book value of $2,500x split evenly between assets that produce gross FDDEI and assets that produce gross RDEI. Accordingly, an interest expense deduction of $150x is apportioned to DC's gross FDDEI. With respect to DC's supportive deductions of $840x that are related to DC's gross DEI, DC apportions such deductions between gross FDDEI and gross RDEI on the basis of gross income. Accordingly, supportive deductions of $420x are apportioned to DC's gross FDDEI. Thus, DC's FDDEI is $230x, which is equal to its gross FDDEI of $800x less $150x of interest expense deduction and $420x of supportive deductions.
(
iii
)
Determination of deemed intangible income.
DC's deemed tangible income return is $100x, which is equal to 10 percent of its QBAI of $1,000x. DC's DEI is $460x, which is equal to its gross DEI of $1,600x less $300x of interest expense deductions and $840x of supportive deductions. Therefore, DC's deemed intangible income is $360x, which is equal to
the excess of its DEI of $460x over its deemed tangible income return of $100x.
(
iv
)
Determination of foreign-derived intangible income.
DC's foreign-derived ratio is 50 percent, which is the ratio of DC's FDDEI of $230x to DC's DEI of $460x. Therefore, DC's FDII is $180x, which is equal to DC's deemed intangible income of $360x multiplied by its foreign-derived ratio of 50 percent.

DC's operations.
DC is engaged in the production and sale of products consisting of two separate product groups in three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Industry Groups, hereafter referred to as Group AAA and Group BBB. All of the gross income of DC is included in gross DEI. DC incurs $250x of research and experimental (R
E) expenditures in the United States that are deductible under section 174. None of the R
E is included in cost of goods sold. For purposes of determining gross FDDEI and gross DEI under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, DC attributes $210x of cost of goods sold to Group AAA products and $900x of cost of goods sold to Group BBB products, and then attributes the cost of goods sold with respect to each such product group ratably between the gross receipts with respect to such product group sold to foreign persons and the gross receipts with respect to such product group not sold to foreign persons. The manner in which DC attributes the cost of goods sold is a reasonable method. For the taxable year, DC has the following income tax items relevant to the determination of its FDII:

PRS's operations.
In addition to its own operations, DC is a partner in PRS, a partnership that also produces products described in SIC Group AAA. DC is allocated 50 percent of all income, gain, loss, and deductions of PRS. During the taxable year, PRS sells Group AAA products solely to foreign persons, and all of its gross income is included in gross DEI. PRS has $400 of gross receipts from sales of Group AAA products for the taxable year and incurs $100x of research and experimental (R
E) expenditures in the United States that are deductible under section 174. None of the R
E is included in cost of goods sold. For purposes of determining gross FDDEI and gross DEI under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, PRS attributes $200x of cost of goods sold to Group AAA products, and then attributes the cost of goods sold with respect to such product group ratably between the gross receipts with respect to such product group sold to foreign persons and the gross receipts with respect to such product group not sold to foreign persons. The manner in which PRS attributes the cost of goods sold is a reasonable method. DC's distributive share of PRS taxable items is $100x of gross income and $50x of R
E deductions, and DC's share of PRS's gross receipts from sales of Group AAA products for the taxable year is $200x under § 1.861-17(f)(3).

Application of the sales method to allocate and apportion R
E.
DC applies the sales method to apportion its R
E deductions under § 1.861-17. Neither DC nor PRS licenses or sells its intangible property to controlled or uncontrolled corporations in a manner that necessitates including the sales by such corporations for purposes of apportioning DC's R
E deductions.

Determination of gross DEI and gross FDDEI.
Under paragraph
(e)(1) of this section, DC's gross DEI, gross FDDEI, and deductions allocable to those amounts include its distributive share of gross DEI, gross FDDEI, and deductions of PRS. Thus, DC's gross DEI for the year is $490x ($390x attributable to DC and $100x attributable to DC's interest in PRS). DC's gross income from sales of Group AAA products to foreign persons is $30x ($100x of gross receipts minus attributable cost of goods sold of $70x). DC's gross income from sales of Group BBB products to foreign persons is $100x ($400x of gross receipts minus attributable cost of goods sold of $300x). DC's gross FDDEI for the year is $230x ($30x from DC's sale of Group AAA products plus $100x from DC's sale of Group BBB products plus DC's distributive share of PRS's gross FDDEI of $100x).
(
ii
)
Allocation and apportionment of R
E deductions.
To determine FDDEI, DC must allocate and apportion its R
E expense of $300x ($250x incurred directly by DC and $50x incurred indirectly through DC's interest in PRS). In accordance with § 1.861-17, R
E expenses are first allocated to a class of gross income related to a three-digit SIC group code. DC's R
E expenses related to products in Group AAA are $90x ($40x incurred directly by DC and $50x incurred indirectly through DC's interest in PRS) and its expenses related to Group BBB are $210x. See paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, all R
E expense attributable to a particular SIC group code is apportioned on the basis of the amounts of sales within that SIC group code. Total sales within Group AAA were $500x ($300x directly by DC and $200x attributable to DC's interest in PRS), $300x of which were made to foreign persons ($100x directly by DC and $200x attributable to DC's interest in PRS). Therefore, the $90x of R
E expense related to Group AAA is apportioned $54x to gross FDDEI ($90x × $300x/$500x) and $36x to gross RDEI ($90x × $200x/$500x). Total sales within Group BBB were $1,200x, $400x of which were made to foreign persons. Therefore, the $210x of R
E expense related to products in Group BBB is apportioned $70x to gross FDDEI ($210x × $400x/$1,200x) and $140x to gross RDEI ($210x × $800x/$1,200x). Accordingly, DC's FDDEI for the tax year is $106x ($230x gross FDDEI minus $124x of R
E ($54x + $70x) allocated and apportioned to gross FDDEI).
(e)
Domestic corporate partners
—(1)
In general.
A domestic corporation's DEI and FDDEI for a taxable year are determined by taking into account the corporation's share of gross DEI, gross FDDEI, and deductions of any partnership (whether domestic or foreign) in which the corporation is a direct or indirect partner. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a domestic corporation's share of each such item of a partnership is determined in accordance with the corporation's distributive share of the underlying items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the partnership that comprise such amounts. See § 1.250(b)-2(g) for rules on calculating the increase to a domestic corporation's QBAI by the corporation's share of partnership QBAI.
(2)
Reporting requirement for partnership with domestic corporate partners.
A partnership that has one or more direct partners that are domestic corporations and that is required to file a return under section 6031 must furnish to each such partner on or with such partner's Schedule K-1 (Form 1065 or any successor form) by the due date (including extensions) for furnishing Schedule K-1 the partner's share of the partnership's gross DEI, gross FDDEI, deductions that are properly allocable to the partnership's gross DEI and gross FDDEI, and partnership QBAI (as determined under § 1.250(b)-2(g)) for each taxable year in which the partnership has gross DEI, gross FDDEI, deductions that are properly allocable to the partnership's gross DEI or gross FDDEI, or partnership specified tangible property (as defined in § 1.250(b)-2(g)(5)). In the case of tiered partnerships where one or more partners of an upper-tier partnership are domestic corporations, a lower-tier partnership must report the amount specified in this paragraph (e)(2) to the upper-tier partnership to allow reporting of such information to any partner that is a domestic corporation. To the extent that a partnership cannot determine the information described in the first sentence of this paragraph (e)(2), the partnership must instead furnish to
each partner its share of the partnership's attributes that a partner needs to determine the partner's gross DEI, gross FDDEI, deductions that are properly allocable to the partner's gross DEI and gross FDDEI, and the partner's adjusted bases in partnership specified tangible property.

Facts.
Under the terms of the partnership agreement, DC is allocated 50 percent of all income, gain, loss, and deductions of PRS. For the taxable year, PRS recognizes $20x of gross income on the sale of general property (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(10)) to FP, a foreign person (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(c)), for a foreign use (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(d)). The gross income recognized on the sale of property is not described in section 250(b)(3)(A)(I) through (VI) or paragraphs (c)(15)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(
2
)
Analysis.
PRS's sale of property to FP is a FDDEI sale as described in § 1.250(b)-4(b). Therefore, the gross income derived from the sale ($20x) is included in PRS's gross DEI and gross FDDEI, and DC's share of PRS's gross DEI and gross FDDEI ($10x) is included in DC's gross DEI and gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Analysis.
PRS's sale of property to FP is excluded from PRS's gross DEI under section 250(b)(3)(A)(VI) and paragraph (c)(15)(vi) of this section. Accordingly, DC's share of PRS's gross income of $10x from the sale is not included in DC's gross DEI or gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

), except that in the same taxable year, PRS also sells property to FP2, a foreign person (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(c)), for a foreign use (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(d)). After taking into account both sales, PRS has a gross loss of $30x.

)
Analysis.
Both the sale of property to FP and the sale of property to FP2 are FDDEI sales because each sale is described in § 1.250(b)-4(b). DC's share of PRS's gross loss ($15x) from the sales is included in DC's gross DEI and gross FDDEI.

Example 4: Sale by partnership to foreign related party of the partnership
—(

)
Facts.
Under the terms of the partnership agreement, DC has 25 percent of the capital and profits interest in the partnership and is allocated 25 percent of all income, gain, loss, and deductions of PRS. PRS owns 100 percent of the single class of stock of FC. In the taxable year, PRS has $20x of gain on the sale of general property (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(10)) to FC, and FC makes a physical and material change to the property within the meaning of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1)(iii)(B) outside the United States before selling the property to customers in the United States.
(

)
Analysis.
The sale of property by PRS to FC is described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) without regard to the application of § 1.250(b)-6, since the sale is to a foreign person (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(c)) for a foreign use (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(d)). However, FC is a foreign related party of PRS within the meaning of section 250(b)(5)(D) and § 1.250(b)-3(b)(6), because FC and PRS are members of a modified affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (c)(17) of this section. Therefore, the
sale by PRS to FC is a related party sale within the meaning of § 1.250(b)-6(b)(1). Under section 250(b)(5)(C)(i) and § 1.250(b)-6(c), because FC did not sell the property, or use the property in connection with other property sold or the provision of a service, to a foreign unrelated party before the property was subject to a domestic use, the sale by PRS to FC is not a FDDEI sale. See § 1.250(b)-6(c)(1). Accordingly, the gain from the sale ($20x) is included in PRS's gross DEI but not its gross FDDEI, and DC's share of PRS's gain ($5x) is included in DC's gross DEI but not gross FDDEI. This is the result notwithstanding that FC is not a related party of DC because FC and DC are not members of a modified affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (c)(17) of this section.
(f)
Determination of FDII for consolidated groups.
A member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) determines its FDII under the rules provided in § 1.1502-50.
(g)
Determination of FDII for tax-exempt corporations.
The FDII of a corporation that is subject to the unrelated business income tax under section 511 is determined only by reference to that corporation's items of income, gain, deduction, or loss, and adjusted bases in property, that are taken into account in computing the corporation's unrelated business taxable income (as defined in section 512). For example, if a corporation that is subject to the unrelated business income tax under section 511 has tangible property used in the production of both unrelated business income and gross income that is not unrelated business income, only the portion of the basis of such property taken into account in computing the corporation's unrelated business taxable income is taken into account in determining the corporation's QBAI. Similarly, if a corporation that is subject to the unrelated business income tax under section 511 has tangible property that is used in both the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI, only the corporation's unrelated business income is taken into account in determining the corporation's dual use ratio with respect to such property under § 1.250(b)-2(d)(3).

§ 1.250(b)-2
Qualified business asset investment (QBAI).
(a)
Scope.
This section provides general rules for determining the qualified business asset investment of a domestic corporation for purposes of determining its deemed tangible income return under § 1.250(b)-1(c)(4). Paragraph (b) of this section defines qualified business asset investment (QBAI). Paragraph (c) of this section defines tangible property and specified tangible property. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining the portion of property that is specified tangible property when the property is used in the production of both gross DEI and gross income that is not gross DEI. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining the adjusted basis of specified tangible property. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining QBAI of a domestic corporation with a short taxable year. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for increasing the QBAI of a domestic corporation by reason of property owned through a partnership. Paragraph (h) of this section provides an anti-avoidance rule that disregards certain transfers when determining the QBAI of a domestic corporation.
(b)
Definition of qualified business asset investment.
The term
qualified business asset investment (QBAI)
means the average of a domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases as of the close of each quarter of the domestic corporation's taxable year in specified tangible property that is used in a trade or business of the domestic corporation and is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167. In the case of partially depreciable property, only the depreciable portion of the property is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167.
(c)
Specified tangible property
—(1)
In general.
The term
specified tangible property
means, with respect to a domestic corporation for a taxable year, tangible property of the domestic corporation used in the production of
gross DEI for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, tangible property of a domestic corporation is used in the production of gross DEI for a taxable year if some or all of the depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the tangible property is either allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) or capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, some or all of the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.
(2)
Tangible property.
The term
tangible property
means property for which the depreciation deduction provided by section 167(a) is eligible to be determined under section 168 without regard to section 168(f)(1), (2), or (5), section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(II), (IV), or (V), and the date placed in service.
(d)
Dual use property
—(1)
In general.
The amount of the adjusted basis in dual use property of a domestic corporation for a taxable year that is treated as adjusted basis in specified tangible property for the taxable year is the average of the domestic corporation's adjusted basis in the property multiplied by the dual use ratio with respect to the property for the taxable year.
(2)
Definition of dual use property.
The term
dual use property
means, with respect to a domestic corporation and a taxable year, specified tangible property of the domestic corporation that is used in both the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, specified tangible property of a domestic corporation is used in the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for a taxable year if less than all of the depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property is either allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) or capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.
(3)
Dual use ratio.
The term
dual use ratio
means, with respect to dual use property, a domestic corporation, and a taxable year, a ratio (expressed as a percentage) calculated as—
(i) The sum of—
(A) The depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2); and
(B) The depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year; divided by
(ii) The sum of—
(A) The total amount of the domestic corporation's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the taxable year; and
(B) The total amount of the domestic corporation's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the income or loss of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d).
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, owns a machine that produces both gross DEI and income that is not gross DEI. The average adjusted basis of the machine for the taxable year in the hands of DC is $4,000x. The depreciation with respect to the machine for the taxable year is $400x, $320x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product A, gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's gross DEI for the taxable year, and $80x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product B, gross income or loss from the sale of which is not taken into account in determining DC's gross DEI for the taxable year. DC also owns an office building for its administrative functions with an average adjusted basis for the taxable year of
$10,000x. DC does not capitalize depreciation with respect to the office building to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building is $1,000x for the taxable year, $750x of which is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2), and $250x of which is allocated and apportioned to income other than gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Dual use property.
The machine and office building are property for which the depreciation deduction provided by section 167(a) is eligible to be determined under section 168 (without regard to section 168(f)(1), (2), or (5), section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(II), (IV), or (V), and the date placed in service). Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the machine and office building are tangible property. Furthermore, because the machine and office building are used in the production of gross DEI for the taxable year within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the machine and office building are specified tangible property. Finally, because the machine and office building are used in both the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for the taxable year within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the machine and office building are dual use property. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amount of DC's adjusted basis in the machine and office building that is treated as adjusted basis in specified tangible property for the taxable year is determined by multiplying DC's adjusted basis in the machine and office building by DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine and office building determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(B)
Depreciation not capitalized to inventory.
Because none of the depreciation with respect to the office building is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to the office building. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building for Year 1 is 75 percent, which is DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building that is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($750x), divided by the total amount of DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building for Year 1 ($1000x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $7,500x ($10,000x × 0.75) of DC's average adjusted bases in the office building is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.
(C)
Depreciation capitalized to inventory.
Because all of the depreciation with respect to the machine is capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine for the taxable year is 80 percent, which is DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory of Product A, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for the taxable year ($320x), divided by DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's income for Year 1 ($400x).Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $3,200x ($4,000x × 0.8) of DC's average adjusted basis in the machine is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.
(e)
Determination of adjusted basis of specified tangible property
—(1)
In general.
The adjusted basis in specified tangible property for purposes of this section is determined by using the cost capitalization methods of accounting used by the domestic corporation for purposes of determining the gross income and deductions of the domestic corporation and the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g), and by allocating the depreciation deduction with respect to such property for the domestic corporation's taxable
year ratably to each day during the period in the taxable year to which such depreciation relates. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the period in the taxable year to which such depreciation relates is determined without regard to the applicable convention under section 168(d).
(2)
Effect of change in law.
The adjusted basis in specified tangible property is determined without regard to any provision of law enacted after December 22, 2017, unless such later enacted law specifically and directly amends the definition of QBAI under section 250 or section 951A. For purposes of applying section 250(b)(2)(B) and this paragraph (e), the technical amendment to section 168(g) (to provide a recovery period of 20 years for qualified improvement property for purposes of the alternative depreciation system) enacted in section 2307(a) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Public Law 116-136 (2020) is treated as enacted on December 22, 2017.
(3)
Specified tangible property placed in service before enactment of section 250.
The adjusted basis in specified tangible property placed in service before December 22, 2017, is determined using the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g), as if this system had applied from the date that the property was placed in service.
(f)
Special rules for short taxable years
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a domestic corporation that has a taxable year that is less than twelve months (a
short taxable year
), the rules for determining the QBAI of the domestic corporation under this section are modified as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to the taxable year.
(2)
Determination of when the quarter closes.
For purposes of determining when the quarter closes, in determining the QBAI of a domestic corporation for a short taxable year, the quarters of the domestic corporation for purposes of this section are the full quarters beginning and ending within the short taxable year (if any), determining quarter length as if the domestic corporation did not have a short taxable year, plus one or more short quarters (if any).
(3)
Reduction of qualified business asset investment.
The QBAI of a domestic corporation for a short taxable year is the sum of—
(i) The sum of the domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property as of the close of each full quarter (if any) in the domestic corporation's taxable year divided by four; plus
(ii) The domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property as of the close of each short quarter (if any) in the domestic corporation's taxable year multiplied by the sum of the number of days in each short quarter divided by 365.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f).
(i)
Facts.
A, an individual, owns all of the stock of DC, a domestic corporation. A owns DC from the beginning of the taxable year. On July 15 of the taxable year, A sells DC to USP, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to A. DC becomes a member of the consolidated group of which USP is the common parent and as a result, under § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii), DC's taxable year is treated as ending on July 15. USP and DC both use the calendar year as their taxable year. DC's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property for the taxable year are $250x as of March 31, $300x as of June 30, $275x as of July 15, $500x as of September 30, and $450x as of December 31.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determination of short taxable years and quarters.
DC has two short taxable years during the year. The first short taxable year is from January 1 to July 15, with two full quarters (January 1 through March 31 and April 1 through June 30) and one short quarter (July 1 through July 15). The second taxable year is from July 16 to December 31, with one short quarter (July 16 through September 30) and one full quarter (October 1 through December 31).
(B)
Calculation of qualified business asset investment for the first short taxable year.
Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for the first short taxable year, DC has three quarter closes (March 31, June 30, and July 15). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the QBAI of DC for the first short taxable year is $148.80x,
the sum of $137.50x (($250x + $300x)/4) attributable to the two full quarters and $11.30x ($275x × 15/365) attributable to the short quarter.
(C)
Calculation of qualified business asset investment for the second short taxable year.
Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for the second short taxable year, DC has two quarter closes (September 30 and December 31). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the QBAI of DC for the second short taxable year is $217.98x, the sum of $112.50x ($450x/4) attributable to the one full quarter and $105.48x ($500x × 77/365) attributable to the short quarter.
(g)
Partnership property
—(1)
In general.
If a domestic corporation holds an interest in one or more partnerships during a taxable year (including indirectly through one or more partnerships that are partners in a lower-tier partnership), the QBAI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph (g)(1)) is increased by the sum of the domestic corporation's partnership QBAI with respect to each partnership for the taxable year.
(2)
Determination of partnership QBAI.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the term
partnership QBAI
means, with respect to a partnership, a domestic corporation, and a taxable year, the sum of the domestic corporation's partner adjusted basis in each partnership specified tangible property of the partnership for each partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year. If a partnership taxable year is less than twelve months, the principles of paragraph (f) of this section apply in determining a domestic corporation's partnership QBAI with respect to the partnership.
(3)
Determination of partner adjusted basis
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the term
partner adjusted basis
means the amount described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to sole use partnership property or paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to dual use partnership property. The principles of section 706(d) apply to this determination.
(ii)
Sole use partnership property
—(A)
In general.
The amount described in this paragraph (g)(3)(ii), with respect to sole use partnership property, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, is the sum of the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the sole use partnership property for the partnership taxable year and the domestic corporation's partner-specific QBAI basis in the sole use partnership property for the partnership taxable year.
(B)
Definition of sole use partnership property.
The term
sole use partnership property
means, with respect to a partnership, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, partnership specified tangible property of the partnership that is used in the production of only gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year in which or with which the partnership taxable year ends. For purposes of the preceding sentence, partnership specified tangible property of a partnership is used in the production of only gross DEI for a taxable year if all the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property (if any) for the partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year is allocated and apportioned to the domestic corporation's gross DEI for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) and, if any of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, all the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's gross income or loss from the sale of such inventory or other property for the partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.
(iii)
Dual use partnership property
—(A)
In general.
The amount described in this paragraph (g)(3)(iii), with respect to dual use partnership property, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, is the sum of the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the property for the partnership taxable year and the domestic corporation's partner-specific QBAI basis in
the property for the partnership taxable year, multiplied by the domestic corporation's dual use ratio with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, except that the ratio described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is determined by reference to the domestic corporation's distributive share of the amounts described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(B)
Definition of dual use partnership property.
The term
dual use partnership property
means partnership specified tangible property other than sole use partnership property.
(4)
Determination of proportionate share of the partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property for a partnership taxable year is the partnership adjusted basis in the property multiplied by the domestic corporation's proportionate share ratio with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year. Solely for purposes of determining the proportionate share ratio under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, the partnership's calculation of, and a partner's distributive share of, any income, loss, depreciation, or cost recovery allowance is determined under section 704(b).
(ii)
Proportionate share ratio.
The term
proportionate share ratio
means, with respect to a partnership, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) calculated as—
(A) The sum of—
(
1
) The domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year; and
(
2
) The amount of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's income or loss for the partnership taxable year; divided by
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) The total amount of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year; and
(
2
) The total amount of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the partnership's income or loss for the partnership taxable year.
(5)
Definition of partnership specified tangible property.
The term
partnership specified tangible property
means, with respect to a domestic corporation, tangible property (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of a partnership that is—
(i) Used in the trade or business of the partnership;
(ii) Of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167; and
(iii) Used in the production of gross income included in the domestic corporation's gross DEI.
(6)
Determination of partnership adjusted basis.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term
partnership adjusted basis
means, with respect to a partnership, partnership specified tangible property, and a partnership taxable year, the amount equal to the average of the partnership's adjusted basis in the partnership specified tangible property as of the close of each quarter in the partnership taxable year determined without regard to any adjustments under section 734(b) except for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(B) or section 734(b)(2)(B) that are attributable to distributions of tangible property (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(A) or 734(b)(2)(A). The principles of paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section apply for purposes of determining a partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property and the proportionate share of the partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property.
(7)
Determination of partner-specific QBAI basis.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term
partner-specific QBAI basis
means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a partnership, and partnership specified tangible property, the amount that is equal to the average of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) that is allocated to the partnership specified tangible property of the partnership with respect to the domestic corporation as of the close of each quarter in the partnership taxable year. For this purpose, a negative basis adjustment under section 743(b) is expressed as a negative number. The principles of paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section apply for purposes of determining the partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to partnership specified tangible property.
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g).
(i)
Assumed facts.
Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples:
(A) DC, DC1, DC2, and DC3 are domestic corporations.
(B) PRS is a partnership and its allocations satisfy the requirements of section 704.
(C) All properties are partnership specified tangible property.
(D) All persons use the calendar year as their taxable year.
(E) There is no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to any property.
(ii)
Example 1: Sole use partnership property
—(A)
Facts.
DC is a partner in PRS. PRS owns two properties, Asset A and Asset B. The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset A is $100x and in Asset B is $500x. In Year 1, PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction is $10x with respect to Asset A and $5x with respect to Asset B, and DC's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction is $8x with respect to Asset A and $1x with respect to Asset B. None of the depreciation with respect to Asset A or Asset B is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's entire distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and Asset B is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI for Year 1 under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
Sole use partnership property.
Because all of DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and B is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI for Year 1, Asset A and Asset B are sole use partnership property within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is equal to the sum of DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1 and DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, respectively.
(
2
)
Proportionate share.
Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, respectively. Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset A or Asset B is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A and Asset B is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and Asset B. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A for Year 1 is 80 percent, which is the ratio of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A for Year 1 ($8x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A for Year 1 ($10x). DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset B for Year 1 is 20 percent, which is the ratio of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset B for Year 1 ($1x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset B for Year 1 ($5x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A is
$80x ($100x × 0.8), and DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset B is $100x ($500x × 0.2).
(
3
)
Partner adjusted basis.
Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset A and Asset B, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is determined entirely by reference to its proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $80x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A, and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $100x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset B.
(

)
Partnership QBAI.
Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $180x, the sum of DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A ($80x) and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B ($100x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $180x.

DC owns a 50 percent interest in PRS. All section 704(b) and tax items are identical and are allocated equally between DC and its other partner. PRS owns three properties, Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E. PRS sells two products, Product A and Product B. All of DC's distributive share of the gross income or loss from the sale of Product A is taken into account in determining DC's DEI, and none of DC's distributive share of the gross income or loss from the sale of Product B is taken into account in determining DC's DEI.

Asset C.
The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset C is $100x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $10x with respect to Asset C, none of which is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C is $5x ($10x × 0.5), $3x of which is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).
(

)
Asset D.
The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset D is $500x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $50x with respect to Asset D, $10x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product A and $40x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. None of the $10x depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $40x capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $5x ($10x × 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $15x ($30x × 0.5).
(

)
Asset E.
The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset E is $600x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $60x with respect to Asset E. Of the $60x depreciation with respect to Asset E, $20x is allowed as a deduction, $24x is capitalized to inventory of Product A, and $16x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E is $10x ($20x × 0.5), $8x of which is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2). None of the $24x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $16x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $12x ($24x × 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $3x ($6x × 0.5).
(B)
Analysis.
Because Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E are not used in the production of only gross DEI in Year 1 within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E are dual use partnership property within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E is the sum of DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, and DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, except that the ratio described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is determined by reference to DC's distributive share of the amounts described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

Proportionate share.
Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C for Year 1. Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset C is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($5x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($10x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C is $50x ($100x × 0.5).
(
ii
)
Dual use ratio.
Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset C is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is 60 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C that is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($3x), divided by the total amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($5x).
(

)
Partner adjusted basis.
Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset C, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C is $30x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C for Year 1 ($50x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C for Year 1 (60 percent).
(

Asset D

)
Proportionate share.
Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D for Year 1. Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with
respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining PRS's section 704(b) income or loss for Year 1 ($40x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is $250x ($500x × 0.5).
(
ii
)
Dual use ratio.
Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is 25 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for Year 1 ($5x), divided by the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x).
(
iii
)
Partner adjusted basis.
Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset D, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D is $62.50x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D for Year 1 ($250x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D for Year 1 (25 percent).
(

)
Asset E
—(
i
)
Proportionate share.
Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E for Year 1. Because the depreciation with respect to Asset E is partly deducted and partly capitalized to inventory, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E is determined by reference to both the depreciation that is deducted and the depreciation that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the sum ($25x) of the amount of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($10x) and the amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's income or loss for Year 1 ($15x), divided by the sum ($50x) of the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($20x) and the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining PRS's section 704(b) income or loss for Year 1 ($30x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E is $300x ($600x × 0.5).
(
ii
)
Dual use ratio.
Because the depreciation with respect to Asset E is partly deducted and partly capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is determined by reference to the depreciation that is deducted and the depreciation that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is 80 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the sum ($20x) of the amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E that is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($8x) and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for Year 1 ($12x), divided by the sum ($25x) of the total amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($10x) and the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A
and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's income or loss for Year 1 ($15x).
(
iii
)
Partner adjusted basis.
Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset E, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is $240x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E for Year 1 ($300x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E for Year 1 (80 percent).
(

)
Partnership QBAI.
Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $332.50x, the sum of DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C ($30x), DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D ($62.50x), and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E ($240x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $332.50x.
(iv)
Example 3: Sole use partnership specified tangible property; section 743(b) adjustments
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that there is an average of $40x positive adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset A as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year with respect to DC under section 743(b) and an average of $20x negative adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset B as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year with respect to DC under section 743(b).
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $120x, which is the sum of $80x (DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
)) and $40x (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $80x, the sum of $100x (DC's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the property as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
)) and (−$20x) (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset B). Therefore, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $200x ($120x + $80x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $200x.
(v)
Example 4: Sale of partnership interest before close of taxable year
—(A)
Facts.
DC1 owns a 50 percent interest in PRS on January 1 of Year 1. PRS does not have an election under section 754 in effect. On July 1 of Year 1, DC1 sells its entire interest in PRS to DC2. PRS owns Asset G. The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset G is $100x. DC1's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G is 25 percent with respect to PRS's entire year. DC2's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G is also 25 percent with respect to PRS's entire year. Both DC1's and DC2's entire distributive shares of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G are allocated and apportioned under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) to DC1's and DC2's gross DEI, respectively, for Year 1. PRS's allocations satisfy section 706(d).
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
DC1.
Because DC1 owns an interest in PRS during DC1's taxable year and receives a distributive share of partnership items of the partnership under section 706(d), DC1 has partnership QBAI with respect to PRS in the amount determined under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, DC1's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25 percent (DC1's section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G). Therefore, DC1's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $25x. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC1 increases its QBAI by $25x for Year 1.
(
2
)
DC2.
DC2's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is also $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25 percent (DC2's
section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G). Therefore, DC2's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $25x. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC2 increases its QBAI by $25x for Year 1.
(vi)
Example 5: Partnership adjusted basis; distribution of property in liquidation of partnership interest
—(A)
Facts.
DC1, DC2, and DC3 are equal partners in PRS, a partnership. DC1 and DC2 each has an adjusted basis of $100x in its partnership interest. DC3 has an adjusted basis of $50x in its partnership interest. PRS has a section 754 election in effect. PRS owns Asset H with a fair market value of $50x and an adjusted basis of $0, Asset I with a fair market value of $100x and an adjusted basis of $100x, and Asset J with a fair market value of $150x and an adjusted basis of $150x. Asset H and Asset J are tangible property, but Asset I is not tangible property. PRS distributes Asset I to DC3 in liquidation of DC3's interest in PRS. None of DC1, DC2, DC3, or PRS recognizes gain on the distribution. Under section 732(b), DC3's adjusted basis in Asset I is $50x. PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is increased by $50x to $50x under section 734(b)(1)(B), which is the amount by which PRS's adjusted basis in Asset I immediately before the distribution exceeds DC3's adjusted basis in Asset I.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is determined without regard to any adjustments under section 734(b) except for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(B) or section 734(b)(2)(B) that are attributable to distributions of tangible property and for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(A) or 734(b)(2)(A). The adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset H is under section 734(b)(1)(B) and is attributable to the distribution of Asset I, which is not tangible property. Accordingly, for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(1) of this section, PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is $0.

Anti-avoidance rule for certain transfers of property
—(1)
In general.
If, with a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return, a domestic corporation transfers specified tangible property (
transferred property
) to a specified related party of the domestic corporation and, within the disqualified period, the domestic corporation or an FDII-eligible related party of the domestic corporation leases the same or substantially similar property from any specified related party, then, solely for purposes of determining the QBAI of the domestic corporation under paragraph (b) of this section, the domestic corporation is treated as owning the transferred property from the later of the beginning of the term of the lease or date of the transfer of the property until the earlier of the end of the term of the lease or the end of the recovery period of the property.
(2)
Rule for structured arrangements.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a transfer of specified tangible property to a person that is not a related party or lease of property from a person that is not a related party is treated as a transfer to or lease from a specified related party if the transfer or lease is pursuant to a structured arrangement. A structured arrangement exists only if either paragraph (h)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section is satisfied.
(i) The reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is priced into the terms of the arrangement with the transferee.
(ii) Based on all the facts and circumstances, the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is a principal purpose of the arrangement. Facts and circumstances that indicate the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is a principal purpose of the arrangement include—
(A) Marketing the arrangement as tax-advantaged where some or all of the tax advantage derives from the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return;
(B) Primarily marketing the arrangement to domestic corporations which earn FDDEI;
(C) Features that alter the terms of the arrangement, including the return, in the event the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is no longer relevant; or
(D) A below-market return absent the tax effects or benefits resulting
from the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return.
(3)
Per se rules for certain transactions.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a transfer of property by a domestic corporation to a specified related party (including a party deemed to be a specified related party under paragraph (h)(2) of this section) followed by a lease of the same or substantially similar property by the domestic corporation or an FDII-eligible related party from a specified related party (including a party deemed to be a specified related party under paragraph (h)(2) of this section) is treated per se as occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return if both the transfer and the lease occur within a six-month period.
(4)
Definitions related to anti-avoidance rule.
The following definitions apply for purpose of this paragraph (h).
(i)
Disqualified period.
The term
disqualified period
means, with respect to a transfer, the period beginning one year before the date of the transfer and ending the earlier of the end of the remaining recovery period (under the system described in section 951A(d)(3)(A)) of the property or one year after the date of the transfer.
(ii)
FDII-eligible related party.
The term
FDII-eligible related party
means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a member of the same consolidated group as the domestic corporation or a partnership with respect to which at least 80 percent of the interests in partnership capital and profits are owned, directly or indirectly, by the domestic corporation or one or more members of the consolidated group that includes the domestic corporation.
(iii)
Specified related party.
The term
specified related party
means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a related party other than an FDII-eligible related party.
(iv)
Transfer.
The term
transfer
means any disposition, exchange, contribution, or distribution of property, and includes an indirect transfer. For example, a transfer of an interest in a partnership is treated as a transfer of the assets of the partnership. In addition, if paragraph (h)(1) of this section applies to treat a domestic corporation as owning specified tangible property by reason of a lease of property, the termination or lapse of the lease of the property is treated as a transfer of the specified tangible property by the domestic corporation to the lessor.
(5)
Transactions occurring before March 4, 2019.
Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a transfer of property that occurs before March 4, 2019.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h).
(i)
Example 1: Sale-leaseback with a related party
—(A)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, owns Asset A, which is specified tangible property. DC also owns all the single class of stock of DS, a domestic corporation, and FS1 and FS2, each a controlled foreign corporation. DC and DS are members of the same consolidated group. On January 1, Year 1, DC sells Asset A to FS1. At the time of the sale, Asset A had a remaining recovery period of 10 years under the alternative depreciation system. On February 1, Year 1, FS2 leases Asset B, which is substantially similar to Asset A, to DS for a five-year term ending on January 31, Year 6.
(B)
Analysis.
Because DC transfers specified tangible property (Asset A), to a specified related party of DC (FS1), and, within a six month period (January 1, Year 1 to February 1, Year 1), an FDII-eligible related party of DC (DS) leases a substantially similar property (Asset B) from a specified related party (FS2), DC's transfer of Asset A and lease of Asset B are treated as per se occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return. Accordingly, for purposes of determining DC's QBAI, DC is treated as owning Asset A from February 1, Year 1, the later of the date of the transfer of Asset A (January 1, Year 1) and the beginning of the term of the lease of Asset B (February 1, Year 1), until January 31, Year 6, the earlier of the end of the term of the lease of Asset B (January 31, Year 6) or the remaining recovery period of Asset A (December 31, Year 10).
(ii)
Example 2: Sale-leaseback with a related party; lapse of initial lease
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(6)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
). In addition, DS allows the lease of Asset B to expire on February 1, Year 6. On June 1, Year 6, DS and FS2 renew the lease for a five-year term ending on May 31, Year 11.
(B)
Analysis.
Because DC is treated as owning Asset A under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the lapse of the lease of Asset B is treated as a transfer of Asset A to FS2 on February 1, Year 6, under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section. Further, because DC is deemed to transfer specified tangible property (Asset A) to a specified related party (FS2) upon the lapse of the lease, and within a six month period (February 1, Year 6 to June 1, Year 6), an FDII-eligible related party of DC (DS) leases a substantially similar property (Asset B), DC's deemed transfer of Asset A under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section and lease of Asset B are treated as per se occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return. Accordingly, for purposes of determining DC's QBAI, DC is treated as owning Asset A from June 1, Year 6, the later of the date of the deemed transfer of Asset A (February 1, Year 6) and the beginning of the term of the lease of Asset B (June 1, Year 6), until December 31, Year 10, the earlier of the end of the term of the lease of Asset B (May 31, Year 11) or the remaining recovery period of Asset A (December 31, Year 10).

Transactions with multiple elements.
A transaction is classified according to its overall predominant character for purposes of determining whether the transaction is a FDDEI sale under § 1.250(b)-4 or a FDDEI service under § 1.250(b)-5. For example, whether a transaction that includes both a sales component and a service component is subject to § 1.250(b)-4 or § 1.250(b)-5 is determined based on whether the overall predominant character, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, is a sale or service. In addition, whether a transaction that includes both a sale of general property and a sale of intangible property is subject to § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1) or § 1.250(b)-4(d)(2) is determined based on whether the overall predominant character, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, is a sale of general property or a sale of intangible property.
(e)
Treatment of partnerships
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether a sale of property to or by a partnership or a provision of a service to or by a partnership is a FDDEI transaction, a partnership is treated as a person. Accordingly, for example, a partnership may be a seller, renderer, recipient, or related party, including a foreign related party (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section).
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e).
(i)
Example 1: Domestic partner sale to foreign partnership with a foreign branch
—(A)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, is a partner in PRS, a foreign partnership. DC and PRS are not related parties. PRS has a foreign branch within the meaning of § 1.904-4(f)(3)(iii). DC and PRS both use the calendar year as their taxable year. For the taxable year, DC recognizes $20x of gain on the sale of general property to PRS for a foreign use (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(d)). During the same taxable year, PRS recognizes $20x of gain on the sale of other general property to a foreign person for a foreign use (as determined under § 1.250(b)-4(d)). PRS's income on the sale of the property is attributable to its foreign branch.
(B)
Analysis.
DC's sale of property to PRS, a foreign partnership, is a FDDEI sale because it is a sale to a foreign person for a foreign use. Therefore, DC's gain of $20x on the sale to PRS is included in DC's gross DEI and gross FDDEI. However, PRS's gain of $20x is not included in the gross DEI or gross FDDEI of PRS because the gain is foreign branch income within the meaning of § 1.250(b)-1(c)(11). Accordingly, none of PRS's gain on the sale of property is included in DC's gross DEI or gross FDDEI under § 1.250(b)-1(e)(1).
(ii)
Example 2: Domestic partner sale to domestic partnership without a foreign branch
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except PRS is a domestic partnership that does not have a foreign branch within the meaning of § 1.904-4(f)(3)(iii).
(B)
Analysis.
DC's sale of property to PRS, a domestic partnership, is not a FDDEI sale because the sale is to a United States person. Therefore, the gross income from DC's sale to PRS is included in DC's gross DEI but is not included in its gross FDDEI. However, PRS's sale of other general property is a FDDEI sale, and therefore the gain of $20x is included in the gross DEI and gross FDDEI of PRS. Accordingly, DC includes its distributive share of PRS's gain from the sale in determining DC's gross DEI and gross FDDEI for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(e)(1).
(f)
Substantiation for certain FDDEI transactions
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for purposes of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1)(ii)(C) (foreign use for sale of general property for resale), § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1)(iii) (foreign use for sale of general property subject to manufacturing, assembly, or processing outside the United States), § 1.250(b)-4(d)(2) (foreign use for sale of intangible property), and § 1.250(b)-5(e) (general services provided to business recipients located outside the United States), a transaction is a FDDEI transaction only if the taxpayer substantiates its determination of foreign use (in the case of sales of property) or location outside the United States (in the case of general services provided to a business recipient) as described in the applicable paragraph of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(3)
or § 1.250(b)-5(e)(4). The substantiating documents must be in existence as of the FDII filing date with respect to the FDDEI transaction, and a taxpayer must provide the required substantiating documents within 30 days of a request by the Commissioner or another period as agreed between the Commissioner and the taxpayer.
(2)
Exception for small businesses.
Paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and the specific substantiation requirements described in the applicable paragraph of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(3) or § 1.250(b)-5(e)(4), do not apply to a taxpayer if the taxpayer and all related parties of the taxpayer, in the aggregate, receive less than $25,000,000 in gross receipts during the taxable year prior to the FDDEI transaction. If the taxpayer's prior taxable year was less than 12 months (a short period), gross receipts are annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 365 and dividing the result by the number of days in the short period.
(3)
Treatment of certain loss transactions
—(i)
In general.
If a domestic corporation fails to satisfy the substantiation requirements described in the applicable paragraph of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(3) or § 1.250(b)-5(e)(4) with respect to a transaction (including in connection with a related party transaction described in § 1.250(b)-6), the gross income from the transaction will be treated as gross FDDEI if—
(A) In the case of a sale of property, the seller knows or has reason to know that property is sold to a foreign person for a foreign use (within the meaning of § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1) or (2));
(B) In the case of the provision of a general service to a business recipient, the renderer knows or has reason to know that a service is provided to a business recipient located outside the United States; and
(C) Not treating the transaction as a FDDEI transaction would increase the amount of the corporation's FDDEI for the taxable year relative to its FDDEI that would be determined if the transaction were treated as a FDDEI transaction.
(ii)
Reason to know
—(A)
Sales to a foreign person for a foreign use.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) of this section, a seller has reason to know that a sale is to a foreign person for a foreign use if the information received as part of the sales process contains information that indicates that the recipient is a foreign person or that the sale is for a foreign use, and the seller fails to obtain evidence establishing that the recipient is not in fact a foreign person or that the sale is not in fact for a foreign use. Information that indicates that a recipient is a foreign person or that the sale is for a foreign use includes, but is not limited to, a foreign phone number, billing address, shipping address, or place of residence; and, with respect to an entity, evidence that the entity is incorporated, formed, or managed outside the United States.
(B)
General services provided to a business recipient located outside the United States.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(i)(B) of this section, a renderer has reason to know that the provision of a general service is to a business recipient located outside the United States if the information received as part of the sales process contains information that indicates that the recipient is a business recipient located outside the United States and the seller fails to obtain evidence establishing that the recipient is not in fact a business recipient located outside the United States. Information that indicates that a recipient is a business recipient includes, but is not limited to, indicia of a business status (such as “LLC” or “Company,” or similar indicia under applicable domestic or foreign law, in the name) or statements by the recipient indicating that it is a business. Information that indicates that a business recipient is located outside the United States includes, but is not limited to, a foreign phone number, billing address, and evidence that the entity or business is incorporated, formed, or managed outside the United States.
(iii)
Multiple transactions.
If a seller or renderer engages in more than one transaction described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section in a taxable year, paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section applies by comparing the corporation's FDDEI if each such transaction were not treated as a FDDEI transaction to its FDDEI if each such transaction were treated as a FDDEI transaction.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(3).
(A)
Facts.
During a taxable year, DC, a domestic corporation, manufactures products A and B in the United States. DC sells product A and product B to Y, a foreign person that is a distributor, for $200x and $800x, respectively. DC knows or has reason to know that all of its sales of product A and product B will ultimately be sold to end users located outside the United States. Y provides DC with a statement that satisfies the substantiation requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section and § 1.250(b)-4(d)(3)(ii) that establishes that its sales of product B are for a foreign use but does not obtain substantiation establishing that any sales of product A are for a foreign use. DC's cost of goods sold is $450x. For purposes of determining gross FDDEI, under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(1) DC attributes $250x of cost of goods sold to product A and $200x of cost of goods sold to product B, and then attributes the cost of goods sold for each product ratably between the gross receipts of such product sold to foreign persons and the gross receipts of such product not sold to foreign persons. The manner in which DC attributes the cost of goods sold is a reasonable method. DC has no other items of income, loss, or deduction.

(B)
Analysis.
By not treating the sales of product A as FDDEI sales, the amount of DC's FDDEI would increase by $50x relative to its FDDEI if the sales of product A were treated as FDDEI sales. Accordingly, because DC knows or has reason to know that its sales of product A are to foreign persons for a foreign use, the sales of product A constitute FDDEI sales under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, and thus the $50x loss from the sale of product A is included in DC's gross FDDEI.

§ 1.250(b)-4
Foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI) sales.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for determining whether a sale of property is a FDDEI sale. Paragraph (b) of this section defines a FDDEI sale. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a recipient is a foreign person. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining whether property is sold for a foreign use. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a special rule for the sale of interests in a disregarded entity. Paragraph (f) of this section provides a rule regarding certain hedging transactions with respect to FDDEI sales.
(b)
Definition of FDDEI sale.
Except as provided in § 1.250(b)-6(c), the term
FDDEI sale
means a sale of general property or intangible property to a recipient that is a foreign person (see paragraph (c) of this section for presumption rules relating to determining foreign person status) and that is for a foreign use (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section). A sale of any property other than general property or intangible property is not a FDDEI sale.
(c)
Presumption of foreign person status
—(1)
In general.
The sale of property is presumed to be to a recipient that is a foreign person for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section if the sale is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, this presumption does not apply if the seller knows or has reason to know that the sale is not to a foreign person. A seller has reason to know that a sale is not to a foreign person if the information received as part of the sales process contains information that indicates that the recipient is not a foreign person and the seller fails to obtain evidence establishing that the recipient is in fact a foreign person. Information that indicates that
a recipient is not a foreign person include, but are not limited to, a United States phone number, billing address, shipping address, or place of residence; and, with respect to an entity, evidence that the entity is incorporated, formed, or managed in the United States.
(2)
Sales of property.
A sale of a property is described in this paragraph (c)(2) if:
(i) The sale is a foreign retail sale;
(ii) In the case of a sale of general property that is not a foreign retail sale and the general property is delivered (such as through a commercial carrier) to the recipient or an end user, the shipping address of the recipient or end user is outside the United States;
(iii) In the case of a sale of general property that is not described in either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the billing address of the recipient is outside the United States; or
(iv) In the case of a sale of intangible property, the billing address of the recipient is outside the United States.
(d)
Foreign use
—(1)
Foreign use for general property
—(i)
In general.
The sale of general property is for a foreign use for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section if the seller determines that the sale is for a foreign use under the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section and the exception in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section does not apply.
(ii)
Rules for determining foreign use
—(A)
Sales that are delivered to an end user by a carrier or freight forwarder.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A), a sale of general property (other than a sale of general property described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(D) through (F) of this section) that is delivered through a carrier or freight forwarder to a recipient that is an end user is for a foreign use if the end user receives delivery of the general property outside the United States. However, a sale described in the preceding sentence is not treated as a sale to an end user for a foreign use if the sale is made with a principal purpose of having the property transported from its location outside the United States to a location within the United States for ultimate use or consumption.
(B)
Sales to an end user without the use of a carrier or freight forwarder.
With respect to sales that are not delivered through the use of a carrier or freight forwarder, a sale of general property (other than a sale of general property described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(D) through (F) of this section) to a recipient that is an end user is for a foreign use if the property is located outside the United States at the time of the sale (including as part of foreign retail sales).
(C)
Sales for resale.
A sale of general property (other than a sale of general property described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(D) through (F) of this section) to a recipient (such as a distributor or retailer) that will resell the general property is for a foreign use if the general property will ultimately be sold to end users outside the United States (including in foreign retail sales) and such sales to end users outside the United States are substantiated under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. In the case of sales of a fungible mass of general property, the taxpayer may presume that the proportion of its sales that are ultimately sold to end users outside the United States is the same as the proportion of the recipient's resales of that fungible mass to end users outside the United States.
(D)
Sales of digital content.
A sale of general property that primarily contains digital content that is transferred electronically rather than in a physical medium is for a foreign use if the end user downloads, installs, receives, or accesses the purchased digital content on the end user's device outside the United States (see § 1.250(b)-5(d)(2) and (e)(2)(iii) for rules that apply in the case of digital content that is not purchased in a sale but is electronically supplied as a service). If information about where the digital content is downloaded, installed, received, or accessed (such as the device's IP address) is unavailable, and the gross receipts from all sales with respect to the end user (which may be a business) are in the aggregate less than $50,000 for the seller's taxable year, a sale of general property described in the preceding sentence is for a foreign use if it is to an end user that has a billing address located outside the United States.
(E)
Sales of international transportation property used for compensation or hire.
A sale of international transportation property used for compensation or hire is for a foreign use if the end user registers the property with a foreign jurisdiction.
(F)
Sales of international transportation property not used for compensation or hire.
A sale of international transportation property not used for compensation or hire is for a foreign use if the end user registers the property in a foreign jurisdiction and hangars or stores the property primarily outside the United States.
(iii)
Sales for manufacturing, assembly, or other processing
—(A)
In general.
A sale of general property is for a foreign use if the sale is to a foreign unrelated party that subjects the property to manufacture, assembly, or other processing outside the United States and such manufacturing, assembly, or other processing outside the United States is substantiated under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. Property is subject to manufacture, assembly, or other processing only if the property is physically and materially changed (as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section) or the property is incorporated as a component into another product (as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section).
(B)
Property subject to a physical and material change.
The determination of whether general property is subject to a physical and material change is made based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. General property is subject to a physical and material change if it is substantially transformed and is distinguishable from and cannot be readily returned to its original state.
(C)
Property incorporated into a product as a component.
General property is a component incorporated into another product if the incorporation of the general property into another product involves activities that are substantial in nature and generally considered to constitute the manufacture, assembly, or processing of property based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. However, general property is not considered a component incorporated into another product if it is subject only to packaging, repackaging, labeling, or minor assembly operations. In addition, general property is treated as a component if the seller expects, using reliable estimates, that the fair market value of the property when it is delivered to the recipient will constitute no more than 20 percent of the fair market value of the finished good into which the general property is directly or indirectly incorporated when the finished good is sold to end users (the “20-percent rule”). If the property could be incorporated into a number of different finished goods, a reliable estimate of the fair market value of the finished good may include the average fair market value of a representative range of such goods. For purposes of the 20-percent rule, all general property that is sold by the seller and incorporated into the finished good is treated as a single item of property if the seller sells the property to the recipient and the seller knows or has reason to know that the components will be incorporated into a single item of property (for example, where multiple components are sold as a kit). A seller knows or has reason to know that the components will be incorporated into a single item of property if the information received as part of the sales process indicates that the components will be included in the same second product or the nature of the components compels inclusion into the second product and the seller fails to obtain evidence to the contrary.
(iv)
Sales of property subject to manufacturing, assembly, or other processing in the United States.
If the seller sells general property to a recipient (other than a related party) for manufacturing, assembly, or other processing within the United States, such property is not sold for a foreign use even if the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section are subsequently satisfied. See § 1.250(b)-6(c) for rules governing sales of general property to a foreign person that is a related party. Property is subject to manufacture, assembly, or other processing only if the property is physically and materially changed (as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section) or the property is incorporated as a component into another product (as described
in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section).
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(1).
(A)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(
1
) DC is a domestic corporation.
(
2
) FP is a foreign person that is a foreign unrelated party with respect to DC.
(
3
) To the extent a sale is for a foreign use, any applicable substantiation requirements described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section are satisfied.
(B)
Examples
—
(
1
)
Example 1: Manufacturing outside the United States
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC sells batteries for $18x to FP. DC expects that FP will insert the batteries into tablets as part of the process of assembling tablets outside the United States. While the tablets are manufactured in a way that end users would not easily be able to remove the batteries, the batteries could be removed from the tablets and would resemble their original state following the removal. The finished tablets will be sold to end users within and outside the United States. DC's batteries are used in two types of tablets, Tablet A and Tablet B. Based on an economic analysis, DC determines that the fair market value of Tablet A is $90x and the fair market value of Tablet B is $110x. FP informs DC that the number of sales of Tablet A is approximately equal to the number of sales of Tablet B.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Because the batteries could be removed from the tablets and be returned to their original state, the insertion of the batteries into the tablets does not constitute a physical and material change described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section. However, the average fair market value of a representative range of tablets that incorporate the batteries is $100x (the average of $90x for Tablet A and $110x for Tablet B because their sales are approximately equal), and $18x is less than 20 percent of $100x. Therefore, the batteries are considered components of the tablets and treated as subject to manufacture, assembly, or other processing outside the United States. See paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)(A) and (C) of this section. As a result, notwithstanding that some tablets incorporating the batteries may be sold to an end user in the United States, DC's sale of batteries is considered for a foreign use. Accordingly, DC's sale of batteries to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) and (C) of this section, and the sale is a FDDEI sale.
(
2
)
Example 2: Manufacturing outside the United States
—(
i
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except FP purchases the batteries from DC for $25x. In addition, FP purchased other components of tablets from other parties. FP has a substantial investment in machinery and tools that are used to assemble tablets.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Even though the fair market value of the batteries that FP purchases from DC and incorporates into the tablets exceeds 20 percent of the fair market value of the tablets, because the batteries are used by FP in activities that are substantial in nature and generally considered to constitute the manufacture, assembly or other processing of property, the batteries are components of the tablets. As a result, DC's sale of property to FP is still for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) and (C) of this section, and the sale is a FDDEI sale.
(
3
)
Example 3: Sale of products to distributor outside the United States
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC sells smartphones to FP, a distributor of electronics located within Country A. The sales contract between DC and FP provides that FP may sell the smartphones it purchases from DC only to specified retailers located within Country A. The specified retailers only sell electronics, including smartphones, in foreign retail sales.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Although FP does not sell the smartphones it purchases from DC to end users, FP sells to retailers that sell the smartphones in foreign retail sales. All of the sales of smartphones from DC to FP are sales of general property for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because FP is only allowed to sell the smartphones to retailers who sell such property in foreign retail sales. As a result, DC's sales of smartphones to FP are FDDEI sales.
(

)
Example 4: Sale of a fungible mass of products
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC and persons other than DC sell multiple units of printer paper that is considered fungible general property to FP during the taxable year. FP is a distributor that sells paper to retail stores within and outside the United States. FP informs DC that approximately 25 percent of FP's sales of the paper are to retail stores located outside of the United States for foreign retail sales.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
The sale of paper to FP is for a foreign use to the extent that the paper will be sold to end users located outside the United States under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. Because a portion of DC's sales to FP are not for a foreign use, DC must determine the amount of paper that is sold for a foreign use. Based on the information provided by FP about its own sales, DC determines under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section that 25 percent of the total units of paper that is fungible general property that FP purchased from all persons in the taxable year will ultimately be sold to end users located outside the United States. Accordingly, DC satisfies the test for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section with respect to 25 percent of its sales of the paper to FP.
(

)
Example 5: Limited use license of copyrighted computer software
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC provides FP with a limited use license to copyrighted computer software in exchange for an annual fee of $100x. The limited use license restricts FP's use of the computer software to 100 of FP's employees, who download the software onto their computers. The limited use license prohibits FP from using the computer software in any way other than as an end user, which includes prohibiting sublicensing, selling, reverse engineering, or modifying the computer software. All of FP's employees download the software onto computers that are physically located outside the United States.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
The software licensed to FP is digital content as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(1), and is downloaded by an end user as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2). Accordingly, because the software is downloaded solely onto computers outside the United States, DC's license to FP is for a foreign use and therefore a FDDEI sale under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. The entire $100x of the license fee is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.
(
6
)
Example 6: Limited use license of copyrighted computer software used within and outside the United States
—(
i
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B)(
5
) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
), except that FP has offices both within and outside the United States, and DC's internal records indicates that 50 percent of the downloads of the software are onto computers located outside the United States.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Because 50 percent of the downloads of the software are onto computers located outside the United States, a portion of DC's license to FP is for a foreign use and therefore such portion is a FDDEI sale. The $50x of license fee derived with respect to such portion is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Facts.
DC sells copyrighted music available for download on its website. Once downloaded, the recipient listens to the music on electronic devices that do not need to be connected to the internet. DC has data that an individual accesses the website to purchase a song for download on a device located outside the United States. The terms of the sale permit the recipient to use the song for personal use, but convey no other rights to the copyrighted music to the recipient.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
The music acquired through download is digital content as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(1). Because the recipient acquires no ownership in copyright rights to the music, the sale is considered a sale of a copyrighted article, and thus is a sale of general property. See § 1.250(b)-3(b)(10) and (11). As a result, the sale is considered for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section because the digital content was installed, received, or accessed on the end user's device outside the United States. The income derived with respect to the sale of the music is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year. See § 1.250(b)-5(d)(3) for an
example of digital content provided to consumers as a service rather than as a sale.

Foreign use for intangible property
—(i)
In general.
A sale of rights to exploit intangible property solely outside the United States is for a foreign use. A sale of rights to exploit intangible property solely within the United States is not for a foreign use. A sale of rights to exploit intangible property worldwide is partially for a foreign use and partially not for a foreign use. Whether intangible property is exploited within versus outside the United States is determined based on revenue earned from end users located within versus outside the United States. Therefore, a sale of rights to exploit intangible property both within and outside the United States is for a foreign use in proportion to the revenue earned from end users located outside the United States over the total revenue earned from the exploitation of the intangible property. A sale of intangible property will be treated as a FDDEI sale only if the substantiation requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section are satisfied. For rules specific to determining end users and revenue earned from end users for intangible property used in sales of general property, provision of services, research and development, or consisting of a manufacturing method or process, see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Determination of end users and revenue earned from end users
—(A)
Intangible property embedded in general property or used in connection with the sale of general property.
If intangible property is embedded in general property that is sold, or used in connection with a sale of general property, then the end user of the intangible property is the end user of the general property. Revenue is earned from the end user of the general property outside the United States to the extent the sale of the general property is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section.
(B)
Intangible property used in providing a service.
If intangible property is used to provide a service, then the end user of that intangible property is the recipient, consumer, or business recipient of the service or, in the case of a property service or a transportation service that involves the transportation of property, the end user is the owner of the property on which such service is being performed. Such end users are treated as located outside the United States only to the extent the service qualifies as a FDDEI service under § 1.250(b)-5. Therefore, in the case of a recipient of a sale of intangible property that uses such intangible property to provide a property service that qualifies as a FDDEI service to another person, that person is the end user and is treated as located outside the United States.
(C)
Intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, if intangible property consists of a manufacturing method or process (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section) and is sold to a foreign unrelated party (including in a sale by a foreign related party), then the foreign unrelated party is treated as an end user located outside the United States, unless the seller knows or has reason to know that the manufacturing method or process will be used in the United States, in which case the foreign unrelated party is treated as an end user located within the United States. A seller has reason to know that the manufacturing method or process will be used in the United States if the information received from the recipient as part of the sales process contains information that indicates that the recipient intends to use the manufacturing method or process in the United States and the seller fails to obtain evidence establishing that the recipient does not intend to use the manufacturing method or process in the United States.
(
2
)
Exception for certain manufacturing arrangements.
A sale of intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process (including a sale by a foreign related party) to a foreign unrelated party for use in manufacturing products for or on behalf of the seller or any person related to the seller does not qualify as a sale to a foreign unrelated party for purposes of determining the end user under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(
3
)
Manufacturing method or process.
For purposes of this section, a manufacturing method or process consists of a sequence of actions or steps that comprise an overall method or process that is used to manufacture a product or produce a particular manufacturing result, which may be in the form of a patent or know-how. Intangible property consisting of the right to make and sell an item of property is not a manufacturing method or process, whereas intangible property consisting of the right to apply a series of actions or steps to be performed to achieve a particular manufacturing result is a manufacturing method or process. For example, a utility or design patent on an article of manufacture, machine, composition of matter, design, or providing the right to sell equipment to perform a process is not a manufacturing method or process, whereas a utility patent covering a method or process of manufacturing is a manufacturing method or process for purposes of this section.
(D)
Intangible property used in research and development.
If intangible property (primary IP) is used to develop new or modify other intangible property (secondary IP), then the end user of the primary IP is the end user (applying paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section) of the secondary IP.
(iii)
Determination of revenue for periodic payments versus lump sums
—(A)
Sales in exchange for periodic payments.
In the case of a sale of intangible property, other than intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process that is sold to a foreign unrelated party, to a recipient in exchange for periodic payments, the extent to which the sale is for a foreign use is determined annually based on the actual revenue earned by the recipient from any use of the intangible property for the taxable year in which a periodic payment is received. If actual revenue earned by the recipient cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts, then estimated revenue earned by a recipient that is not a related party of the seller from the use of the intangible property may be used based on the principles of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Sales in exchange for a lump sum.
In the case of a sale of intangible property, other than intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process that is sold to a foreign unrelated party, for a lump sum, the extent to which the sale is for a foreign use is determined based on the ratio of the total net present value of revenue the seller would have expected to earn from the exploitation of the intangible property outside the United States to the total net present value of revenue the seller would have expected to earn from the exploitation of the intangible property. In the case of a recipient that is a foreign unrelated party, net present values of revenue that the recipient expected to earn from the exploitation of the intangible property within and outside the United States may also be used if the seller obtained such revenue data from the recipient near the time of the sale and such revenue data was used to negotiate the lump sum price paid for the intangible property. Net present values must be determined using reliable inputs including, but not limited to, reliable revenue, expenses, and discount rates. The extent to which the inputs are used by the parties to determine the sales price agreed to between the seller and a foreign unrelated party purchasing the intangible property will be a factor in determining whether such inputs are reliable. If the intangible property is sold to a foreign related party, the reliability of the inputs used to determine net present values and the net present values are determined under section 482.
(C)
Sales to a foreign unrelated party of intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process.
In the case of a sale to an unrelated foreign party of intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process, the revenue earned from the end user is equal to the amount received from the recipient in exchange for the manufacturing method or process. In the case of a bundled sale of intangible property consisting of a manufacturing method or process and intangible property not consisting of a manufacturing method or process, the revenue earned from the intangible property consisting of the manufacturing method or process
equals the total amount paid for the bundled sale multiplied by the proportion that the value of the manufacturing method or process bears to the total value of the intangible property. The value of the manufacturing method or process to the total value of the intangible property must be determined using the principles of section 482.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2).
(A)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(

Example 1: License of worldwide rights with actual revenue data from recipient
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC licenses to FP worldwide rights to the copyright to composition A in exchange for annual royalties of 60 percent of revenue from FP's sales of composition A. FP sells composition A to customers through digital downloads from servers. In the taxable year, FP earns $100x in revenue from sales of copies of composition A to customers, of which $60x is from customers located in the United States and the remaining $40x is from customers located outside the United States. FP provides DC with reliable records showing the amount of revenue earned in the taxable year from sales of composition A to establish the royalties owed to DC. These records also provide DC with the amount of revenue earned from sales of composition A to customers located within the United States.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
FP is not the end user of the copyright to composition A under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section because the copyright is used in the sale of general property (the sale of copyrighted articles to customers). The customers that purchase a copy of composition A from FP are the end users (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) because those customers are the recipients of composition A when sold as general property. Based on the actual revenue earned by FP from sales of composition A, 40 percent ($40x/$100x) of the revenue generated by the copyright during the taxable year is earned outside the United States. Accordingly, a portion of DC's license to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore such portion is a FDDEI sale. The $24x of royalty (0.40 x $60x of total royalties owed to DC during the taxable year) derived with respect to such portion is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except FP pays DC a fixed annual payment of $60x each year for the worldwide rights to the copyright to composition A and does not provide DC with data showing how much revenue FP earned from sales of composition A, even after DC requests that FP provide it with such information. DC also is unable to determine how much revenue FP earned from sales of composition A to customers within the United States from the data it has with respect to FP and publicly available data with respect to FP. However, DC's economic analysis of the revenue DC expected it could earn annually from use of composition A as part of determining the annual payments DC would receive from FP from the license of composition A supports a determination that 40 percent of sales of composition A during the tax year would be to customers located outside the United States. During an examination of DC's return for the taxable year, DC provides the IRS with data explaining the economic analysis, inputs, and results from its valuation of composition A used in determining the amount of annual payments agreed to by DC and FP.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
For the same reasons provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
), the customers that purchase copies of composition A from FP are the end users. DC is allowed to use reliable economic analysis to estimate revenue earned by FP from the use of the copyright to composition A under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section because DC was unable to obtain actual revenue earned by FP from use of the copyright to composition A during the taxable year after reasonable efforts to obtain the actual revenue data. Based on DC's economic analysis, a portion of DC's license to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore such portion is a FDDEI sale. $24x of the $60x fixed payment to DC (0.40 x $60x) is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Example 3: Sale of patent rights protected in the United States and other countries; use of financial projections in sale to foreign unrelated party
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC owns a patent for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) approved for treatment of disease A (“indication A”) in the United States and in Countries A, B, and C. The patent is registered in the United States and in Countries A, B, and C. DC sells to FP all of its patent rights to the API for indication A for a lump sum payment of $1,000x. DC has no basis in the patent rights. To determine the sales price for the patent rights, DC projected that the net present value of the revenue it would earn from selling a pharmaceutical product incorporating the API for indication A was $5,000x, with 15 percent of the net present value of revenue earned from sales within the United States and 85 percent of the net present value of revenue earned from sales outside the United States. DC did not obtain revenue projections from the recipient.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
FP is not the end user of the patent under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section because the patent is used in the sale of general property (the sale of pharmaceutical products to customers) and FP is not the recipient of that general property. The unrelated party customers that purchase the finished pharmaceutical product from FP are the end users (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) because those customers are the unrelated party recipients of the pharmaceutical product when sold as general property. Based on the financial projections DC used to determine the sales price of the patent that FP purchased, a portion of DC's sale to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and such portion is a FDDEI sale. The $850x (85 percent × $1,000x) of gain derived with respect to such portion is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

During the examination of DC's return for the taxable year, the IRS determines that DC's substantiation allocating the projected revenue from sales within the United States and outside the United States does not reflect reliable inputs to determine the net present values of revenues under section 482, but determines that the total lump sum price FP paid for DC's patent rights is an arm's length price. The IRS determines that the most reliable net present values of revenue DC would have earned from sales within the United States and outside the United States is $750x and $4250x, respectively.
(

)
Analysis.
For the same reasons provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B)(

)(

) of this section (the analysis in
Example 3
), the customers that purchase the finished pharmaceutical product from FP are the end users. Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the reliability of the inputs DC used to determine the net present values and the net present values are determined under section 482. Based on the sales
price of the patent that FP purchased and the IRS-determined net present values of revenue DC would have earned from sales within the United States and outside the United States, a portion of DC's sale to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and such portion is a FDDEI sale. DC is allowed to include $850x (($4250x divided by $5000x) × $1,000x) of gain in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Example 5: Sale of patent of manufacturing method or process protected in the United States and other countries; foreign unrelated party
—(

)
Facts.
DC owns the worldwide rights to a patent covering a process for refining crude oil. DC sells to FP the right to DC's patented process for refining crude oil for a lump sum payment of $100x. DC has no basis in the patent rights. DC does not know or have reason to know that FP will use the patented process to refine crude oil within the United States or will sell or license the rights to the patent to a person to refine crude oil within the United States.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DC's patent covering a process for refining crude oil is a manufacturing method or process as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, FP is treated as the end user of the patent, and is treated as located outside the United States because FP is a foreign unrelated party and DC does not know or have reason to know that the patented process will be used in the United States. As a result, all of the sale to FP is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore is a FDDEI sale. The entire $100x lump sum payment is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Example 6: License of intangible property that includes a patented manufacturing method or process protected in the United States and other countries; foreign unrelated party
—(
i
)
Facts.
DC owns worldwide rights to patents, know-how, and a trademark and tradename for product Z. The patents consist of: a patent covering the right to make, use, and sell product Z (article of manufacture), a patent covering the rights to make, use, and sell a composition of substances used in certain components of product Z (composition of matter), and a patent covering the right to use a manufacturing process consisting of a series of manufacturing steps to manufacture product Z (manufacturing method or process as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section) and to sell the product Z that FP manufactures using the manufacturing method or process. The know-how consists entirely of manufacturing know-how used to implement the manufacturing steps that comprise the manufacturing method or process. DC licenses the worldwide rights to the patents, know-how, and the trademark and tradename for product Z to FP in exchange for annual royalties of 60 percent of revenue from sales of product Z. FP manufactures product Z in country X and sells product Z to DC2, a domestic corporation and unrelated party to DC and FP, for resale to customers located within the United States. FP also sells product Z to FP2, a foreign unrelated party with respect to DC and FP, for resale to customers located outside the United States. During the taxable year, FP sells to DC2 $140x of product Z. Also, during the taxable year, FP sells to FP2 $60x of product Z. DC determines under the principles of section 482 that the licensed know-how and the patented manufacturing method or process comprise 10 percent of the arm's length price of the intangible property DC licenses to FP.

Analysis
—(A)
End users.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, FP is treated as the end user of the patent covering the right to use the manufacturing process and the manufacturing know-how used to implement the manufacturing method or process, and is treated as located outside the United States because FP is a foreign unrelated party and DC does not know or have reason to know that the patented process and know-how will be used in the United States. DC2, FP, and FP2 are not the end users of the remaining intangible property under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section because that intangible property is used in the sale of general property (the sale of product Z) and DC2, FP, and FP2 are not the end users of that general property. The unrelated party customers that purchase product Z
from DC2 and FP2 are the end users (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) because those customers are the unrelated party recipients of product Z.
(B)
Foreign use.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, revenue from royalties paid for the intangible property other than the manufacturing method or process is earned from end users outside the United States to the extent the sale of the general property is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. FP2 is a reseller of product Z to end users outside the United States, so all sales of product Z to FP2 are for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. Because DC has determined that 10 percent of the value of the intangible property consists of a manufacturing method or process (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section) used to manufacture product Z, $12x of the $120x royalty FP pays to DC during the taxable year is for foreign use ($120x total royalty × 0.10) based on the location of FP's manufacturing utilizing the know-how or all of the sequence of actions that comprise the manufacturing method or process under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section. Based on the sales of product Z within and outside the United States, $32.4x of the royalties FP pays DC for rights to the licensed intangible property during the taxable year (($60x of revenue from sales to FP2 for resale to customers located outside the United States divided by $200x total worldwide sales revenue FP receives from DC2 and FP2) × ($120x total royalties less $12 of those royalties attributable to the manufacturing method or process)) qualifies as income earned from the sale of intangible property for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore such portion is a FDDEI sale. As a result, $44.40x of royalties ($12x + $32.40x) is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Analysis
—(A)
End users.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, FP is not treated as the end user of the patent covering the right to use the manufacturing process and the manufacturing know-how used to implement the manufacturing method or process because FP is a foreign related party with respect to DC. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, FP2 is also not treated as the end user of the patent covering the right to use the manufacturing process and the manufacturing know-how used to implement the manufacturing method or process because FP2 is using that intangible property to manufacture product Z for FP. DC2 is also not treated as the end user of the patent covering the right to use the manufacturing process and the manufacturing know-how used to implement the manufacturing method or process because DC2 does not use the patent or know-how in manufacturing. DC2, FP, and FP2 are not the end users of the remaining intangible property under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section because that intangible property is used in the sale of general property (the sale of product Z) and DC2, FP, and FP2 are not the end users of that general property. The unrelated party customers that purchase the Product Z from DC2 and FP are the end users (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) of the intangible property because those customers are the persons that ultimately use or consume product Z.
(B)
Foreign use.
Based on the sales of product Z to customers located within and outside the United States, $72x of the royalties FP pays DC for rights to
the licensed intangible property during the taxable year (($120x of revenue from sales to customers located outside the United States divided by $200x total worldwide sales revenue) × $120x total royalties) qualifies as income earned from the sale of intangible property for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and therefore such portion is a FDDEI sale. As a result, $72x of royalties is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Facts.
DC owns 100 percent of the stock of FP, a foreign related party with respect to DC. FP manufactures and sells product A. For the taxable year, DC contributes to FP exclusive worldwide rights to patents, trademarks, know-how, customer lists, and goodwill and going concern value (collectively, intangible property) related to product A in an exchange described in section 351. DC is required to report an annual income inclusion on its Federal income tax return based on the productivity, use, or disposition of the contributed intangible property under section 367(d). DC includes a percentage of FP's revenue in its gross income under section 367(d) each year. In the current taxable year, FP earns $1,000x of revenue from sales of product A. Based on reliable sales records kept by FP for the taxable year, $300x of FP's revenue is earned from sales of product A to customers within the United States, and $700x of its revenue is earned from sales of product A to customers outside the United States.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DC's deemed sale of the intangible property to FP in exchange for payments contingent upon the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible property related to product A under section 367(d) is a sale for purposes of section 250 and this section. See § 1.250(b)-3(b)(16). Based on FP's sales records for the taxable year, 70 percent of DC's deemed sale to FP is for a foreign use, and 70 percent of DC's income inclusion under section 367(d) derived with respect to such portion is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Facts.
DC owns the worldwide rights to a patent on a silicon chip used in computers, tablets, and smartphones. The patent does not qualify as a manufacturing method or process (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section). DC licenses the worldwide rights to the patent to FP in exchange for annual royalties of 30 percent of revenue from sales of the silicon chips. During the taxable year, FP manufactures silicon chips protected by the patent and sells all of those chips to FP2 for $1,000x. FP2 also purchases similar silicon chips from other suppliers. FP2 uses the silicon chips in computers, tablets, smartphones, and motherboards that FP2 manufactures in country X and sells to its customers located within the United States and foreign countries. For purposes of this example, FP2's manufacturing qualifies as subjecting the silicon chips to manufacture, assembly, or other processing outside the United States as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
FP is not the end user or treated as an end user (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) because FP is not the unrelated party recipient of the general property in which the patent is embedded, and the patent does not qualify as a manufacturing method or process. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, revenue from royalties paid for the patent is earned from end users outside the United States to the extent the sale of the general property is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Because FP2 is subjecting the silicon chips to manufacture, assembly, or other processing outside the United States, the revenue from royalties FP pays to DC qualifies for foreign use based on the location of FP2's manufacturing and qualifies as a FDDEI sale. As a result, the entire $300x of annual royalties paid by FP to DC during the taxable year is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

FP2 sells and ships computers, tablets, and smartphones it manufactures with the silicon chips it purchases from FP to unrelated party wholesalers located within and outside the United States. The wholesalers within the United States only sell to retailers located within the United States and the wholesalers outside the United States only sell to retailers located outside the United States. The retailers within the United States only sell to customers located within the United States and the retailers located outside the United States only sell to customers located outside the United States. FP2 earns $15,000x of revenue from sales to unrelated party wholesalers located outside the United States and $10,000x of revenue from sales to unrelated party wholesalers located within the United States. FP2 also sells and ships motherboards with the silicon chips it purchases from FP to unrelated party manufacturers located outside the United States. FP2 does not sell motherboards with the silicon chips it purchases from FP to unrelated party manufacturers located within the United States. FP2 earns $5,000x of revenue from the sales of these motherboards to manufacturers located outside the United States. For purposes of this example, these manufacturers subject the motherboards to manufacture, assembly, or other processing outside the United States as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the customers of the retailers that purchase from the unrelated party wholesalers are the end users. Because the wholesalers located outside the United States only sell to retailers located outside the United States that sell to end users located outside the United States, the location of the wholesalers is a reliable basis for determining the location of the end users. Revenue from royalties paid for the patent is earned from end users outside the United States to the extent the sale of the general property is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A portion of the sales to the unrelated party wholesalers qualify as foreign use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the sales to the unrelated party manufacturers qualify as foreign use under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, revenue from royalties FP pays to DC is from a FDDEI sale to the extent of such sales to the unrelated party manufacturers and such portion of sales to unrelated party wholesalers that qualify for foreign use. As a result, $200x of annual royalties paid by FP to DC during the taxable year ((($15,000x of sales to wholesalers located outside the United States plus $5,000x of sales to manufacturers located outside the United States) divided by $30,000x total sales) × $300x) is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Analysis.
FP is not the end user or treated as an end user (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) because FP is not the unrelated party recipient of the general property in which the patent is embedded (the silicon chips) and the patent does not qualify as a manufacturing method or process. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, revenue from royalties paid for the patent is earned from end users outside the United States to the extent the sale of the general property is for a foreign use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Because FP2 is subjecting the silicon chips to manufacture, assembly,
or other processing within the United States, the revenue from royalties FP pays to DC does not qualify as foreign use based on the location of FP2's manufacturing and therefore does not qualify as a FDDEI sale. As a result, none of the $300x of annual royalties paid by FP to DC during the taxable year is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Example 12: License of intangible property used to provide a service
—(

)
Facts.
DC licenses to FP worldwide rights to the copyrights on movies in exchange for an annual royalty of $100x. FP also licenses copyrights on movies from persons other than DC. FP provides a streaming service that meets the definition of an electronically supplied service in § 1.250(b)-5(c)(5) to its customers within the United States and foreign countries. FP's streaming service provides its customers a catalog of movies to choose to stream. These movies include the copyrighted movies FP licenses from DC. FP does not provide DC with data showing how much revenue FP earned from streaming services during the taxable year, even after DC requests that FP provide it with such information. DC also is unable to determine how much revenue FP earned from streaming services to customers within the United States from the data it has with respect to FP and publicly available data with respect to FP. However, DC's economic analysis of the revenue DC expected it could earn annually from use of the copyrights as part of determining the annual payments DC would receive from FP from the license of the copyrights supports a determination that $10,000x of revenue would be earned during the taxable year from customers worldwide, and that 40 percent of that revenue would be earned from customers located outside the United States. During an examination of DC's return for the taxable year, DC provides the IRS with data explaining the economic analysis, inputs, and results from its valuation of the copyrights used in determining the amount of annual payments agreed to by DC and FP.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's customers are the end users of the copyrights FP licenses from DC because FP uses those copyrights to provide the general service to FP's customers. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, revenue from royalties paid for the copyrights is earned from end users outside the United States to the extent the service qualifies as a FDDEI service under § 1.250(b)-5. DC is allowed to use reliable economic analysis to estimate revenue earned by FP from streaming the licensed movies under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section because DC was unable to obtain actual revenue earned by FP from use of the copyrights during the taxable year after reasonable efforts to obtain the actual revenue data. Based on DC's reliable economic analysis, $40x of the annual royalty payment to DC (0.40 × $100x total annual royalty payment) is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Example 13: License of intangible property used in research and development of other intangible property
— (

)
Facts.
DC owns a patent (“patent A”) for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) approved for treatment of disease A in the United States and in foreign countries. DC licenses to FP worldwide rights to patent A for an annual royalty of $100x. FP uses patent A in research and development of a new API for treatment of disease B. Patent A does not consist of a manufacturing method or process (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section). FP's research and development is successful, resulting in FP obtaining both a patent for the new API for treatment of disease B and approval for use in the United States and foreign countries. FP does not earn any revenue from sales of finished pharmaceutical products containing the API during years 1 through 4 of the license of patent A. In year 5 of the license of patent A, FP earns $800x of revenue from sales of finished pharmaceutical products containing the API to customers located within the United States and $200x of revenue from sales to customers located in foreign countries.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
FP is not the end user (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this section) of patent A because FP is not the end user described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A)
of this section of the product in which the API that was developed from patent A is embedded. The unrelated party customers that purchase the finished pharmaceutical product from FP are the end users (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3(b)(2) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this section) because those customers are the end users described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section of the pharmaceutical product in which the newly developed patent is embedded. During the taxable years that include years 1 through 4 of the license of patent A, FP earns no revenue from sales of the API to a foreign person for a foreign use. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, none of the $100x annual royalty payments to DC for each of the tax years that include years 1 through 4 of the license of patent A is included in DC's gross FDDEI. Based on FP's sales of the API during the tax year that includes year 5 of the license of patent A, $20x of the annual royalty payment to DC ($200x of revenue from sales of API to customers located outside the United States divided by $1,000x total worldwide revenue earned from sales of the API) × $100x annual royalty) is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(3).
(A)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(
1
) DC is a domestic corporation.
(
2
) FP is a foreign person located within Country A that is a foreign unrelated party with respect to DC.
(

Example 1: Substantiation by seller of sale of products to distributor outside the United States with taxpayer statement and corroborating evidence
—(

)
Facts.
DC sells smartphones to FP, a distributor of electronics that sells property to end users. As part of their regular business process and pursuant to DC's terms and conditions of sales, DC issues commercial invoices to FP that contain a condition that any subsequent sales must be to end users outside the United States. At or near the time of the FDII filing date, DC prepares a statement containing the information required in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) of this section. During an examination of DC's return for the taxable year, the IRS requests substantiation information of foreign use. DC submits the commercial invoices issued to FP as supporting information that FP's customers are end users outside the United States and all other corroborating evidence to the IRS.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DC's sale to FP is a sale of general property for resale subject to the substantiation requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. DC satisfies the substantiation requirement by providing the statement that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) of this section. The commercial invoices issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of sales sufficiently corroborate DC's statement that the smartphones will ultimately be sold to end users outside of the United States.

Facts.
DC sells cameras to FP, a distributor of electronics that sells property to end users outside the United States. FP issues sales invoices to its end users. The invoices contain detailed information about the nature of the subsequent sales of the cameras and the location of the end users for value added tax (VAT) purposes. DC is able to obtain copies of FP's VAT invoices with respect to the camera sales that were maintained and submitted pursuant to Country A law. Rather than prepare a statement described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, DC submits FP's invoices to the IRS as substantiation of foreign use.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DC's sale to FP is a sale of general property for resale subject to the substantiation requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. DC satisfies the substantiation requirements by providing the invoices that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. The VAT invoices issued by FP pursuant to Country A law constitute credible evidence from FP that ultimate sales are to end users located outside the United States.
(e)
Sales of interests in a disregarded entity.
Under Federal income tax principles, the sale of any interest in an entity that is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes is considered the sale of the assets of that entity, and this section applies to the sale of each such asset that is general property or
intangible property for purposes of determining whether such sale qualifies as a FDDEI sale.
(f)
FDDEI sales hedging transactions
—(1)
In general.
The amount of a corporation's or partnership's gross FDDEI from FDDEI sales of general property in a taxable year is increased by any gain, or decreased by any loss, taken into account in that taxable year with respect to any FDDEI sales hedging transactions (determined by taking into account the applicable Federal income tax accounting rules, including § 1.446-4).
(2)
FDDEI sales hedging transaction
—The term
FDDEI sales hedging transaction
means a transaction that meets the requirements of § 1.1221-2(a) through (e) and that is identified in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f), except that the transaction must manage risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to ordinary property, as provided in § 1.1221-2(b)(1), and the ordinary property whose price risk is being hedged must be general property that is sold in a FDDEI sale.

(b)
Definition of FDDEI service.
Except as provided in § 1.250(b)-6(d), the term
FDDEI service
means a provision of a service described in any one of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. If only a portion of a service is treated as provided to a person, or with respect to property, outside the United States, the provision of the service is a FDDEI service only to the extent of the gross income derived with respect to such portion.
(1) The provision of a general service to a consumer located outside the United States (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section).
(2) The provision of a general service to a business recipient located outside the United States (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section).
(3) The provision of a proximate service to a recipient located outside the United States (as determined under paragraph (f) of this section).
(4) The provision of a property service with respect to tangible property located outside the United States (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section).
(5) The provision of a transportation service to a recipient, or with respect to property, located outside the United States (as determined under paragraph (h) of this section).
(c)
Definitions.
This paragraph (c) provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section and § 1.250(b)-6.
(1)
Advertising service.
The term
advertising service
means a general service that consists primarily of transmitting or displaying content (including via the internet) with a purpose to generate revenue based on the promotion of a product or service.
(2)
Benefit.
The term
benefit
has the meaning set forth in § 1.482-9(l)(3).
(3)
Business recipient.
The term
business recipient
means a recipient other than a consumer and includes all related parties of the recipient. However, if the recipient is a related party of the taxpayer, the term does not include the taxpayer.
(4)
Consumer.
The term
consumer
means a recipient that is an individual that purchases a general service for personal use.
(5)
Electronically supplied service.
The term
electronically supplied service
means, with respect to a general service other than an advertising service, a service that is delivered primarily over the internet or an electronic network and for which value of the service to the end user is derived primarily from automation or electronic delivery. Electronically supplied services include the provision of access to digital content (as defined in § 1.250(b)-3), such as streaming content; on-demand network access to computing resources, such as networks, servers, storage, and software; the provision or support of a business or personal presence on a network, such as a website or a web page; online intermediation platform services; services automatically generated from a computer via the internet or other network in response to data input by the recipient; and similar services. Electronically supplied services do not include services that primarily involve the application of human effort by the renderer (not considering the human effort involved in the development or maintenance of the technology enabling the electronically supplied services). Accordingly, electronically supplied services do not include certain services (such as legal, accounting, medical, or teaching services) involving primarily human effort that are provided electronically.
(6)
General service.
The term
general service
means any service other than a property service, proximate service, or transportation service. The term
general service
includes advertising services and electronically supplied services.
(7)
Property service.
The term
property service
means a service, other than a transportation service, provided with respect to tangible property, but only if substantially all of the service is performed at the location of the property and results in physical manipulation of the property such as through manufacturing, assembly, maintenance, or repair. Substantially all of a service is performed at the location of property only if the renderer spends more than 80 percent of the time providing the service at or near the location of the property.
(8)
Proximate service.
The term
proximate service
means a service, other than a property service or a transportation service, provided to a consumer or business recipient, but only if substantially all of the service is performed in the physical presence of the consumer or, in the case of a business recipient, substantially all of the service is performed in the physical presence of persons working for the business recipient such as employees, contractors, or agents. Substantially all of a service is performed in the physical presence of a consumer or persons working for a business recipient only if the renderer spends more than 80 percent of the time providing the service in the physical presence of such persons.
(9)
Transportation service.
The term
transportation service
means a service to transport a person or property using aircraft, railroad rolling stock, vessel, motor vehicle, or any other mode of transportation. Transportation services include freight forwarding and similar services.
(d)
General services provided to consumers
—(1)
In general.
A general service is provided to a consumer located outside the United States if the consumer of a general service resides outside of the United States when the service is provided. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if the renderer does not have or cannot after reasonable efforts obtain the consumer's location of residence when the service is provided, the consumer of a general service is treated as residing at the location of the consumer's billing address. However, the rule in the preceding sentence allowing for the use of a consumer's billing address does not apply if the renderer knows or has reason to know that the consumer does not reside outside the United States. A renderer has reason to know that the consumer does not reside outside the United States if the information received as part of the provision of the service indicates that the consumer resides in the United States and the renderer fails to obtain evidence establishing that the consumer resides outside the United States.
(2)
Electronically supplied services.
The consumer of an electronically supplied service is deemed to reside at the location of the device used to receive the service. Such location may be determined based on the location of the IP address when the electronically supplied service is provided. However, if the renderer does not have or cannot after reasonable efforts obtain the consumer's device location, then the location of the device is treated as being outside the United States if the renderer's billing address for the consumer is outside of the United States, subject to the knowledge and reason to know standards described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d) of this section.
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, provides a streaming movie service on its website. The terms of the service allow consumers to watch movies over the internet. The terms of the service permit the consumer to view the movies for personal use, but convey no ownership of movies to the consumers.
(ii)
Analysis.
The streaming service is a FDDEI service under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the extent that the service is provided to consumers that reside outside the United States. The service that DC provides is a general service, provided to consumers that is an electronically supplied service under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Therefore, the consumers are deemed to reside at the location of the devices used to receive the service under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. However, if the renderer cannot reasonably obtain the consumers' device location (such as IP addresses), the device location is treated as being outside the United States if their billing addresses are outside the United States. See § 1.250(b)-4(d)(1)(v)(B)(
7
) for an example of digital content provided to consumers as a sale rather than a service.
(e)
General services provided to business recipients
—(1)
In general.
A general service is provided to a business recipient located outside the United States to the extent that the service confers a benefit on the business recipient's operations outside the United States under the rules in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The location of residence, incorporation, or formation of a business recipient is not relevant to determining the location of the business recipient's operations that benefit from a general service.
(2)
Determination of business operations that benefit from the service
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the determination of which operations of the business recipient located outside the United States benefit from a general service, and the extent to which such operations benefit, is made under the principles of § 1.482-9 by treating the taxpayer as one controlled taxpayer, the portions of the business recipient's operations within the United States (if any) that may benefit from the general service as one or more controlled taxpayers, and the portions of the business recipient's operations outside the United States (if any) that may benefit from the general service, each as one or more controlled taxpayers. The extent to which a business recipient's operations within or outside of the United States are treated as one or more separate controlled taxpayers is determined under any reasonable method (for example, separate controlled taxpayers may be determined on a per entity or per country basis, or by aggregating all of the business recipient's operations outside the United States as one controlled taxpayer). The determination of the amount of the benefit conferred on the business recipient's operations that are treated as controlled taxpayers is determined under a reasonable method consistent with the principles of § 1.482-9(k), treating the renderer's gross income from the services provided to the business recipient as if it were a “cost” as that term is used in § 1.482-9(k). Reasonable methods may include, for example, allocations based on time spent or costs incurred by the renderer or sales, profits, or assets of the business recipient. The determination is made when the service is provided based on information obtained from the business recipient or on the renderer's own records (such as time spent working with the business recipient's offices located outside the United States).
(ii)
Advertising services.
With respect to advertising services, the operations of the business recipient that benefit from the advertising service provided by the renderer are deemed to be located where the advertisements are viewed by individuals. If advertising services are displayed via the internet, the advertising services are viewed at the location of the device on which the advertisements are viewed. For this purpose, the IP address may be used to establish the location of a device on which an advertisement is viewed.
(iii)
Electronically supplied services.
With respect to an electronically supplied service, the operations of the business recipient that benefit from that service provided by the renderer are deemed to be located where the business recipient (including employees, contractors, or agents) accesses or otherwise uses the service. If it cannot be determined whether the location is within or outside the United States (such as where the location of access cannot be reliably determined using the location of the IP address of the device used to receive the service), and the gross receipts from all services with respect to the business recipient are in the aggregate less than $50,000 for the renderer's taxable year, the operations of the business recipient that benefit from the service provided by the renderer are deemed to be located at the recipient's billing address; otherwise, the operations of the business recipient that benefit are deemed to be located in the United States. If the renderer provides a service that is partially an electronically supplied service and partially a general service that is not an electronically supplied service (such as a service that is performed partially online and partially by mail or in person), the location of the business recipient is determined using the rule for electronically supplied services in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) if the primary purpose of the service is to provide electronically supplied services; otherwise, the rule for general services described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section applies.
(3)
Identification of business recipient's operations
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), except with respect to advertising services and electronically supplied services, a business recipient is treated as having operations where it maintains an office or other fixed place of business. In general, an office or other fixed place of business is a fixed facility, that is, a place, site, structure, or other similar facility, through which the business recipient engages in a trade or business. For purposes of making the determination in this paragraph (e)(3)(i), the renderer may make reliable assumptions based on the information available to it.
(ii)
Advertising services and electronically supplied services.
The location of a business recipient that receives advertising services or electronically supplied services will be determined under the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, respectively, even if the business recipient does not maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the locations where the advertisements are viewed (in the case of advertising services) or where the general service is accessed (in the case of electronically supplied services).
(iii)
No office or fixed place of business.
In the case of general services other than advertising services and other than electronically supplied services, if the business recipient does not have an identifiable office or fixed place of business (including the office of a principal manager or managing owner), the business recipient is deemed to be located at its primary billing address.
(4)
Substantiation of the location of a business recipient's operations outside the United States.
Except as provided in § 1.250(b)-3(f)(3) (relating to certain loss transactions), a general service provided to a business recipient is treated as a FDDEI service only if the renderer substantiates its determination of the extent to which the service benefits a business recipient's operations outside the United States. A renderer satisfies the preceding sentence if the renderer maintains one or more of the following items—
(i) Credible evidence obtained or created in the ordinary course of business from the business recipient establishing the extent to which operations of the business recipient outside the United States benefit from the service; or
(ii) A written statement prepared by the renderer containing the information described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section corroborated by evidence that is credible and sufficient to support the information provided.
(A) The name of the business recipient;
(B) The date or dates of the service;
(C) The amount of gross income from the service;
(D) A full description of the service;
(E) A description of how the service will benefit the business recipient; and
(F) An explanation of how the renderer determined what portion of the service will benefit the business recipient's operations located outside the United States.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e).
(i)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(A) DC is a domestic corporation.
(B) A and R are not related parties of DC.
(C) Except as otherwise provided, the substantiation requirements described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section are satisfied.
(ii)
Examples

)
Facts.
For the taxable year, DC provides a consulting service to R, a company that operates restaurants within and outside of the United States, in exchange for $150x. Fifty percent of the sales earned by R and its related parties are from customers located outside of the United States. However, the consulting service that DC provides relates specifically to a single chain of fast food restaurants that R operates. Sales information that R provides to DC indicates that 70 percent of the sales of the fast food restaurant chain are from locations within the United States and 30 percent of the sales are from Country X. DC determines that the use of sales is a reasonable method under the principles of § 1.482-9(k) to allocate the benefit of the consulting service among R's fast food operations.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, DC's service is provided to a person located outside the United States to the extent that DC's service confers a benefit to R's operations outside the United States. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, DC, R's fast food operations within the United States, and R's fast food operations in Country X, are treated as if they were controlled taxpayers because only these operations may benefit from DC's service. The principles of § 1.482-9(k) apply to determine the amount of DC's service that benefits R's operations outside the United States. DC's gross income is allocated based on the sales of the fast food chain of restaurants that benefits from DC's service because using sales is a reasonable method. Therefore, 30 percent of the provision of the consulting service is treated as the provision of a service to a person located outside the United States and a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Accordingly, $45x ($150x × 0.30) of DC's gross income from the provision of the consulting service is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A)(

) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that DC provides an information technology service to R that benefits R's entire business. DC determines that the use of sales is a reasonable method under the principles of § 1.482-9(k) to allocate the benefit of the information technology service among R's entire business.
(
2
)
Analysis.
DC, R's operations within the United States, and R's operations in Country X, are treated as if they were controlled taxpayers because the service that DC provides relates to R's entire business. DC's gross income is allocated based on sales of the entire business because using sales is a reasonable method to determine the amount of DC's service that benefits R's operations outside the United States under the principles of § 1.482-9(k). Therefore, 50 percent of the provision of the information technology service is treated as a service to a person located outside the United States
and a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Accordingly, $75x ($150x × 0.50) of DC's gross income from the provision of the information technology service is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.
(C)
Example 3: Advertising services
—(

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that DC provides an advertising service to R. DC displays advertisements for R's restaurant chain on its social media website and smartphone application. Based on the IP addresses of the devices on which the advertisements are viewed, 20 percent of the views of the advertisements were from devices located outside the United States.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the service that DC provides is an advertising service, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as modified by paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, R's operations that benefit from DC's advertising service are deemed to be where the advertisements are viewed. Therefore, 20 percent of the provision of the advertising service is treated as a service to a person located outside the United States and a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Accordingly, $30x ($150x × 0.20) of DC's gross income from the provision of the advertising service is included in DC's gross FDDEI for the taxable year.
(D)
Example 4: No reliable information about which operations benefit from the service or publicly available information
—(
1
)
Facts.
For the taxable year, DC provides a consulting service to R, a business-facing company that does not advertise its business. All of DC's interaction with R is through R's employees that report to an office in the United States. Statements made by R's employees indicate that the service will benefit R's business operations located within and outside the United States, but do not provide information that would allow DC to reliably determine the extent to which its service will confer a benefit on R's business operations located outside the United States.
(
2
)
Analysis.
DC is unable to determine the extent to which its service will confer a benefit on R's business operations located outside the United States under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, DC cannot substantiate a determination of the extent to which the service benefits a business recipient's operations outside the United States under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Therefore, no portion of DC's service is a FDDEI service.
(E)
Example 5: Electronically supplied services that are accessed by the business recipient's employees
—(
1
)
Facts.
DC provides payroll services for R. As part of this service, DC maintains a website through which R can enter payroll information for its employees and through which R's employees can enter and change their personal information. DC also causes R's employees' paychecks to be directly deposited into their bank accounts and pays R's employment taxes on R's behalf. The primary purpose of the service is to pay R's employees. R has 100 user accounts that access DC's website. Sixty of the user accounts that access DC's website access the website from devices that are located outside the United States and forty of the user accounts access the website from devices that are located inside the United States.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, DC's service is provided to a person located outside the United States to the extent that DC's service confers a benefit to R's operations outside the United States. The service that DC provides to R is an electronically supplied service under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as modified by paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, R's operations that benefit from DC's services are deemed to be located where R accesses the service, which is where R's employees access the website. See paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, the portion of the payroll service that is treated as a service to a person located outside the United States and a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is determined based on the extent to which the locations where R accesses the website are located outside the United States. Because 60 percent (60/100) of user accounts access DC's website from locations outside the United States, 60 percent of the provision of the payroll
service is treated as a service to a person located outside the United States and a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(F)
Example 6: Electronically supplied services that are accessed by the business recipient's customers
— (

)
Facts.
DC maintains an inventory management website for R, a company that sells consumer goods online. R's offices and all of its employees, who use the website, are located in the United States, but R sells its products to customers both within and outside the United States.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, DC's service is provided to a person located outside the United States to the extent that DC's service confers a benefit to R's operations outside the United States. The service that DC provides to R is an electronically supplied service under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as modified by paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, R's operations that benefit from DC's services are deemed to be located where the service is accessed by employees. Therefore, none of the provision of the inventory management website is treated as a service to a person located outside the United States and none is a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(G)
Example 7: Service provided to a domestic person
—(
1
)
Facts.
A, a domestic corporation that operates solely in the United States, enters into a services agreement with R, a company that operates solely outside the United States. Under the agreement, A agrees to perform a consulting service for R. A hires DC to provide a service to A that A will use in the provision of a consulting service to R.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because DC provides a service to A, a person located within the United States, DC's provision of the service to A is not a FDDEI service under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, even though the service is used by A in providing a service to R, a person located outside the United States. See also section 250(b)(5)(B)(ii). However, A's provision of the consulting service to R may be a FDDEI service, in which case A's gross income from the provision of such service would be included in A's gross FDDEI.
(f)
Proximate services.
A proximate service is provided to a recipient located outside the United States if the proximate service is performed outside the United States. In the case of a proximate service performed partly within the United States and partly outside of the United States, a proportionate amount of the service is treated as provided to a recipient located outside the United States corresponding to the portion of time the renderer spends providing the service outside of the United States.
(g)
Property services
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a property service is provided with respect to tangible property located outside the United States only if the property is located outside the United States for the duration of the period the service is performed.
(2)
Exception for services provided with respect to property temporarily in the United States.
A property service is deemed to be provided with respect to tangible property located outside the United States if the following conditions are satisfied—
(i) The property is temporarily in the United States for the purpose of receiving the property service;
(ii) After the completion of the service, the property will be primarily hangared, stored, or used outside the United States;
(iii) The property is not used to generate revenue in the United States at any point during the duration of the service; and
(iv) The property is owned by a foreign person that resides or primarily operates outside the United States.
(h)
Transportation services.
Except as provided in this paragraph (h), a transportation service is provided to a recipient, or with respect to property, located outside the United States only if both the origin and the destination of the service are outside of the United States. However, in the case of a transportation service provided to a recipient, or with respect to property, where either the origin or the destination of the service is outside of the United States, but not both, then 50 percent of
the gross income from the transportation service is considered derived from services provided to a recipient, or with respect to property, located outside the United States.

§ 1.250(b)-6
Related party transactions.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for determining whether a sale of property or a provision of a service to a related party is a FDDEI transaction. Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions relevant for determining whether a sale of property or a provision of a service to a related party is a FDDEI transaction. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a sale of general property to a foreign related party is a FDDEI sale. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining whether the provision of a general service to a business recipient that is a related party is a FDDEI service.
(b)
Definitions.
This paragraph (b) provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Related party sale.
The term
related party sale
means a sale of general property to a foreign related party. See § 1.250(b)-1(e)(3)(ii)(D) (
Example 4
) for an illustration of a related party sale in the case of a seller that is a partnership.
(2)
Related party service.
The term
related party service
means a provision of a general service to a business recipient that is a related party of the renderer and that is described in § 1.250(b)-5(b)(2) without regard to paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Unrelated party transaction.
The term
unrelated party transaction
means, with respect to property purchased by a foreign related party (the “purchased property”) in a related party sale from a seller—
(i) A sale of the purchased property by the foreign related party in the ordinary course of its business to a foreign unrelated party with respect to the seller;
(ii) A sale of property by the foreign related party to a foreign unrelated party with respect to the seller, if the purchased property is a constituent part of the property sold to the foreign unrelated party;
(iii) A sale of property by the foreign related party to a foreign unrelated party with respect to the seller, if the purchased property is not a constituent part of the product sold to the foreign unrelated party but rather is used in connection with producing the property sold to the foreign unrelated party; or
(iv) A provision of a service by the foreign related party to a foreign unrelated party with respect to the seller, if the purchased property was used in connection with the provision of the service.
(c)
Related party sales
—(1)
In general.
A related party sale of general property is a FDDEI sale only if the requirements described in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section are satisfied with respect to the related party sale. This paragraph (c) does not apply in determining whether a sale of intangible property to a foreign related party is a FDDEI sale.
(i)
Sale of property in an unrelated party transaction.
A related party sale is a FDDEI sale if an unrelated party transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section occurs with respect to the property purchased in the related party sale and such unrelated party transaction is described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) (definition of FDDEI sale). The seller in the related party sale may establish that an unrelated party transaction will occur with respect to the property, or what portion of the property will be sold in an unrelated party transaction in the case of sale of a fungible mass of general property, based on contractual terms (including, for example, that the related party is contractually bound to only sell the product to foreign unrelated parties), past practices of the foreign related party (such as practices to only sell products to foreign unrelated parties), a showing that the product sold is designed specifically for a foreign market, or books and records otherwise evidencing that sales will be made to foreign unrelated parties.
(ii)
Use of property in an unrelated party transaction.
A related party sale
is a FDDEI sale if one or more unrelated party transactions described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section occurs with respect to the property purchased in the related party sale and such unrelated party transaction or transactions would be described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) or § 1.250(b)-5(b) (definition of FDDEI service). If the property purchased in the related party sale will be used in unrelated party transactions described in the preceding sentence and other transactions, the amount of gross income from the related party sale that is attributable to a FDDEI sale is equal to the gross income from the related party sale multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the revenue that the related party reasonably expects (as of the FDII filing date) to earn from all unrelated party transactions with respect to the property purchased in the related party sale that would be described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) or § 1.250(b)-5(b) and the denominator of which is the total revenue that the related party reasonably expects (as of the FDII filing date) to earn from all transactions with respect to the property purchased in the related party sale.
(2)
Treatment of foreign related party as seller or renderer.
For purposes of determining whether a sale of property or provision of a service by a foreign related party is, or would be, described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) or § 1.250(b)-5(b), the foreign related party that sells the property or provides the service is treated as a seller or renderer, as applicable, and the foreign unrelated party is treated as the recipient.
(3)
Transactions between related parties.
For purposes of determining whether an unrelated party sale has occurred and satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to a sale to a foreign related party (and not for purposes of determining whether a sale is to a foreign person as required by § 1.250(b)-4(b)), the seller and all related parties of the seller are treated as if they are part of a single foreign related party. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in determining whether a United States person is a member of the seller's modified affiliated group, and therefore a related party of the seller, the definition of the term
modified affiliated group
in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(17) applies without the substitution of “more than 50 percent” for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears. Accordingly, if a foreign related party sells or uses property purchased in a related party sale in a transaction with a second related party of the seller, transactions between the second related party and an unrelated party may be treated as an unrelated party transaction for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1) of this section to a related party sale.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c).
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, sells a machine to FC, a foreign related party of DC in a transaction described in § 1.250(b)-4(b) (without regard to this paragraph (c)). FC uses the machine solely to manufacture product A. As of the FDII filing date for the taxable year, 75 percent of future revenue from sales by FC to unrelated parties of product A will be from sales that would be described in § 1.250(b)-4(b).
(ii)
Analysis.
The sale by DC to FC is a related party sale. Because FC uses the machine to make product A, but the machine is not a constituent part of product A because FC does not undertake further manufacturing with respect to the machine itself, FC's sale of product A is an unrelated party transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Therefore, DC's sale of the machine is only a FDDEI sale if the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. Because 75 percent of the revenue from future sales of product A will be from unrelated party transactions that would be described in § 1.250(b)-4(b), 75 percent of the revenues from DC's sale of the machine to FC constitute FDDEI sales.
(d)
Related party services
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (d)(1), a related party service is a FDDEI service only if the related party service is not substantially similar to a service that has been provided or will be provided by the related party to a person located within the United States. However, if a related party service is substantially similar to a service provided (in whole or in part)
by the related party to a person located in the United States solely by reason of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of gross income from the related party service attributable to a FDDEI service is equal to the difference between the gross income from the related party service and the amount of the price paid by persons located within the United States that is attributable to the related party service. Section 250(b)(5)(C)(ii) and this paragraph (d)(1) apply only to a general service provided to a related party that is a business recipient and are not applicable with respect to any other service provided to a related party.
(2)
Substantially similar services.
A related party service is substantially similar to a service provided by the related party to a person located within the United States only if the related party service is used by the related party in whole or part to provide a service to a person located within the United States and either—
(i) 60 percent or more of the benefits conferred by the related party service are directly used by the related party to confer benefits on consumers or business recipients located within the United States; or
(ii) 60 percent or more of the price paid by consumers or business recipients located within the United States for the service provided by the related party is attributable to the related party service.
(3)
Special rules.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the rules in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.
(i)
Rules for determining the location of and price paid by recipients of a service provided by a related party.
The location of a consumer or business recipient with respect to services provided by the related party is determined under § 1.250(b)-5(d) and (e)(2), respectively, but treating the related party as the renderer. Accordingly, if the related party provides a service to a business recipient, the related party is treated as conferring benefits on a person located within the United States to the extent that the service confers a benefit on the business recipient's operations located within the United States. Similarly, for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to business recipients, the price paid by a business recipient to the related party for services is allocated proportionally based on the locations of the business recipient that benefit from the services provided by the related party.
(ii)
Rules for allocating the benefits provided by and price paid to the renderer of a related party service.
For purposes of applying paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section with respect to benefits that are directly used by the related party to confer benefits on its recipients, the benefits provided by the renderer to the related party are allocated to the related party's consumers or business recipients within the United States based on the proportion of benefits conferred by the related party on consumers or business recipients located within the United States. For purposes of determining the amount of the price paid by persons located within the United States that is attributable to the related party service in applying paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, if the related party provides services that confer benefits on persons located within the United States and outside the United States, the price paid for the related party service by the related party to the renderer is allocated proportionally based on the benefits conferred on each location by the related party to its recipients.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d).
(i)
Assumed facts.
The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples—
(A) DC is a domestic corporation.
(B) FC is a foreign corporation and a foreign related party of DC that operates solely outside the United States.
(C) The service DC provides to FC is a general service provided to a business recipient located outside the United States as described in § 1.250(b)-5(b)(2) without regard to the application of paragraph (d) of this section.
(D) The benefits conferred by DC's service to FC's customers are not indirect or remote within the meaning of § 1.482-9(l)(3)(ii).
(ii)
Examples
—
(A)
Example 1: Services that are substantially similar services under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section
—(

)
Facts.
FC enters into a services agreement with R, a company that operates restaurant chains within and outside the United States. Under the agreement, FC agrees to furnish a design for the renovation of a chain of restaurants that R owns; the design will include architectural plans. FC hires DC to provide an architectural service to FC that FC will use in the provision of its design service to R. The architectural service that DC provides to FC will serve no other purpose than to enable FC to provide its service to R. The service that FC provides will benefit only R's operations within the United States. FC pays an arm's length price of $50x to DC for the architectural service and DC recognizes $50x of gross income from the service. FC incurs additional costs to add additional design elements to the plans and charges R a total of $100x for its service.
(
2
)
Analysis.
All of the service that DC provides to FC is directly used in the provision of a service to R because FC uses DC's architectural service to provide its design service to R, and the architectural service that DC provides to FC will serve no purpose other than to enable FC to provide its service to R. In addition, FC is treated as conferring benefits only to persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section because only R's operations within the United States benefit from the service provided by FC that used the service provided by DC. Therefore, the service provided by DC to FC is substantially similar to the service provided by FC to R under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, DC's provision of the architectural service to FC is not a FDDEI service under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and DC's gross income from the architectural service ($50x) is not included in its gross FDDEI.

)
Analysis under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
All of the service that DC provides to FC is directly used in the provision of a service to R. However, because 90 percent of R's operations that will benefit from FC's service are located outside the United States under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, only 10 percent of the benefits of FC's service are conferred on persons located within the United States.Further, because FC's service confers a benefit on R's operations located within and outside the United States, the benefit provided by DC to FC is allocated proportionately based on the locations of R that benefit from the services provided by FC under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Therefore, only 10 percent of DC's architectural service are directly used by FC to confer benefits on persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the architectural service provided by DC to FC is not substantially similar to the design service provided by FC to persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

Analysis
—(
i
)
Price paid by persons located within the United States.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, FC is treated as conferring benefits on a person located within the United States to the extent that R's operations that will benefit from FC's service are located within the United States. Further, because FC's service confers a benefit on R's operations located within and outside the United States, the price paid by R to FC ($100x) is allocated proportionately based on the locations of R that benefit from the services provided
by FC under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, because 10 percent of R's operations that will benefit from FC's services are located within the United States, persons located within the United States are treated as paying $10x ($100x × 0.10) for FC's services for purposes of applying the test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(
ii
)
Amount attributable to the related party service.
The service that FC provides to R is attributable in part to DC's service because FC uses the architectural plans that DC provides to provide a service to R. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because the benefits of the service provided by FC are conferred on persons located within the United States and outside the United States, a proportionate amount (10 percent) of the price paid to DC for the related party service ($75x), or $7.5x, is treated as attributable to the services provided to persons located within the United States.

Application of test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

). Accordingly, of the price treated as paid to FC by persons located within the United States, 75 percent ($7.5x/$10x) is attributable to the related party service. Because more than 60 percent of the price treated as paid by persons within the United States for FC's service is attributable to DC's service, the service provided by DC to FC is substantially similar to the design service provided by FC to persons located within the United States under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

Conclusion.
Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, because the related party service provided by DC is substantially similar to the service provided by FC to a person located in the United States solely by reason of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the difference between DC's gross income from the related party service and the amount of the price paid by persons located within the United States that is attributable to the related party service is treated as a FDDEI service. Accordingly, $67.5x ($75x—$7.5x) of DC's gross income from the provision of the service to FC is treated as a FDDEI service.

# Items Not Deductible
§ 1.261-1
General rule for disallowance of deductions.
In computing taxable income, no deduction shall be allowed, except as otherwise expressly provided in Chapter 1 of the Code, in respect of any of the items specified in Part IX (section 262 and following), Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.262-1
Personal, living, and family expenses.
(a)
In general.
In computing taxable income, no deduction shall be allowed, except as otherwise expressly provided in chapter 1 of the Code, for personal, living, and family expenses.
(b)
Examples of personal, living, and family expenses.
Personal, living, and family expenses are illustrated in the following examples:
(1) Premiums paid for life insurance by the insured are not deductible. See also section 264 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The cost of insuring a dwelling owned and occupied by the taxpayer as a personal residence is not deductible.
(3) Expenses of maintaining a household, including amounts paid for rent, water, utilities, domestic service, and the like, are not deductible. A taxpayer who rents a property for residential purposes, but incidentally conducts business there (his place of business being elsewhere) shall not deduct any part of the rent. If, however, he uses part of the house as his place of business, such portion of the rent and other similar expenses as is properly attributable to such place of business is deductible as a business expense.
(4) Losses sustained by the taxpayer upon the sale or other disposition of property held for personal, living, and family purposes are not deductible. But see section 165 and the regulations thereunder for deduction of losses sustained to such property by reason of casualty, etc.
(5) Expenses incurred in traveling away from home (which include transportation expenses, meals, and lodging) and any other transportation expenses are not deductible unless they qualify as expenses deductible under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses), section 170 (relating to charitable contributions), section 212 (relating to expenses for production of income), section 213 (relating to medical expenses), or section 217 (relating to moving expenses), and the regulations under those sections. The taxpayer's costs of commuting to his place of business or employment are personal expenses and do not qualify as deductible expenses. For expenses paid or incurred before October 1, 2014, a taxpayer's expenses for lodging when not traveling away from home (local lodging) are nondeductible personal expenses. However, taxpayers may deduct local lodging expenses that qualify under section 162 and are paid or incurred in taxable years for which the period of limitation on credit or refund under section 6511 has not expired. For expenses paid or incurred on or after October 1, 2014, a taxpayer's local lodging expenses are personal expenses and are not deductible unless they qualify as deductible expenses under section 162. Except as permitted under section 162 or 212, the costs of a taxpayer's meals not incurred in traveling away from home are nondeductible personal expenses.
(6) Amounts paid as damages for breach of promise to marry, and attorney's fees and other costs of suit to recover such damages, are not deductible.
(7) Generally, attorney's fees and other costs paid in connection with a divorce, separation, or decree for support are not deductible by either the husband or the wife. However, the part of an attorney's fee and the part of the other costs paid in connection with a divorce, legal separation, written separation agreement, or a decree for support, which are properly attributable to the production or collection of amounts includible in gross income under section 71 are deductible by the wife under section 212.
(8) The cost of equipment of a member of the armed services is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds nontaxable allowances received for such equipment and to the extent that such equipment is especially required by his profession and does not merely take the place of articles required in civilian life. For example, the cost of a sword is an allowable deduction in computing taxable income, but the cost of a uniform is not. However, amounts expended by a reservist for the purchase and maintenance of uniforms which may be worn only when on active duty for training for temporary periods, when attending service school courses, or when attending training assemblies are deductible except to the extent that nontaxable allowances are received for such amounts.
(9) Expenditures made by a taxpayer in obtaining an education or in furthering his education are not deductible unless they qualify under section 162 and § 1.162-5 (relating to trade or business expenses).
(c)
Cross references.
Certain items of a personal, living, or family nature are deductible to the extent expressly provided under the following sections, and the regulations under those sections:
(1) Section 163 (interest).
(2) Section 164 (taxes).
(3) Section 165 (losses).
(4) Section 166 (bad debts).
(5) Section 170 (charitable, etc., contributions and gifts).
(6) Section 213 (medical, dental, etc., expenses).
(7) Section 214 (expenses for care of certain dependents).
(8) Section 215 (alimony, etc., payments).
(9) Section 216 (amounts representing taxes and interest paid to cooperative housing corporation).
(10) Section 217 (moving expenses).

§ 1.263(a)-1
Capital expenditures; in general.
(a)
General rule for capital expenditures.
Except as provided in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, no deduction is allowed for—
(1) Any amount paid for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate; or
(2) Any amount paid in restoring property or in making good the exhaustion thereof for which an allowance is or has been made.
(b)
Coordination with other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Nothing in this section changes the treatment of any amount that is specifically provided for under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the Treasury Regulations other than section 162(a) or section 212 and the regulations under those sections. For example, see section 263A, which requires taxpayers to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs to property produced by the taxpayer and property acquired for resale. See also section 195 requiring taxpayers to capitalize certain costs as start-up expenditures.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Amount paid.
In the case of a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, the terms
amount paid
and
payment
mean a liability incurred (within the meaning of § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)). A liability may not be taken into account under this section prior to the taxable year during which the liability is incurred.
(2)
Produce
means construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, create, raise, or grow. This definition is intended to have the same meaning as the definition used for purposes of section 263A(g)(1) and § 1.263A-2(a)(1)(i), except that improvements are excluded from the definition in this paragraph
(c)(2) and are separately defined and addressed in § 1.263(a)-3.
(d)
Examples of capital expenditures.
The following amounts paid are examples of capital expenditures:
(1) An amount paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal tangible property. See § 1.263(a)-2.
(2) An amount paid to improve a unit of real or personal tangible property. See § 1.263(a)-3.
(3) An amount paid to acquire or create intangibles. See § 1.263(a)-4.
(4) An amount paid or incurred to facilitate an acquisition of a trade or business, a change in capital structure of a business entity, and certain other transactions. See § 1.263(a)-5.
(5) An amount paid to acquire or create interests in land, such as easements, life estates, mineral interests, timber rights, zoning variances, or other interests in land.
(6) An amount assessed and paid under an agreement between bondholders or shareholders of a corporation to be used in a reorganization of the corporation or voluntary contributions by shareholders to the capital of the corporation for any corporate purpose. See section 118 and § 1.118-1.
(7) An amount paid by a holding company to carry out a guaranty of dividends at a specified rate on the stock of a subsidiary corporation for the purpose of securing new capital for the subsidiary and increasing the value of its stockholdings in the subsidiary. This amount must be added to the cost of the stock in the subsidiary.
(e)
Amounts paid to sell property
—(1)
In general.
Commissions and other transaction costs paid to facilitate the sale of property are not currently deductible under section 162 or 212. Instead, the amounts are capitalized costs that reduce the amount realized in the taxable year in which the sale occurs or are taken into account in the taxable year in which the sale is abandoned if a deduction is permissible. These amounts are not added to the basis of the property sold or treated as an intangible asset under § 1.263(a)-4. See § 1.263(a)-5(g) for the treatment of amounts paid to facilitate the disposition of assets that constitute a trade or business.
(2)
Dealer in property.
In the case of a dealer in property, amounts paid to facilitate the sale of such property are treated as ordinary and necessary business expenses.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples, which assume the sale is not an installment sale under section 453, illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1. Sales costs of real property
A owns a parcel of real estate. A sells the real estate and pays legal fees, recording fees, and sales commissions to facilitate the sale. A must capitalize the fees and commissions and, in the taxable year of the sale, must reduce the amount realized from the sale of the real estate by the fees and commissions.

# Example 2. Sales costs of dealers
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A is a dealer in real estate. The commissions and fees paid to facilitate the sale of the real estate may be deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses under section 162.

# Example 3. Sales costs of personal property used in a trade or business
B owns a truck for use in B's trade or business. B decides to sell the truck on November 15, Year 1. B pays for an appraisal to determine a reasonable asking price. On February 15, Year 2, B sells the truck to C. In Year 1, B must capitalize the amount paid to appraise the truck, and in Year 2, must reduce the amount realized from the sale of the truck by the amount paid for the appraisal.

# Example 4. Costs of abandoned sale of personal property used in a trade or business
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that, instead of selling the truck on February 15, Year 2, B decides on that date not to sell the truck and takes the truck off the market. In Year 1, B must capitalize the amount paid to appraise the truck. However, B may recognize the amount paid to appraise the truck as a loss under section 165 in Year 2, the taxable year when the sale is abandoned.

# Example 5. Sales costs of personal property not used in a trade or business
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that B does not use the truck in B's trade or business but instead uses it for personal purposes. In Year 1, B must capitalize the amount paid to appraise the truck, and in Year 2, must reduce the amount realized from the sale of the truck by the amount paid for the appraisal.

# Example 6. Costs of abandoned sale of personal property not used in a trade or business
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that, instead of selling the truck on February 15, Year 2, B decides on that date not to sell the truck and takes the truck off the market. In Year 1, B must capitalize the amount paid to appraise the truck. Although B abandons the sale in Year 2, B may not
treat the amount paid to appraise the truck as a loss under section 165 because the truck was not used in B's trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit.
(f)
De minimis safe harbor election
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) may not capitalize under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) or § 1.263(a)-3(d) any amount paid in the taxable year for the acquisition or production of a unit of tangible property nor treat as a material or supply under § 1.162-3(a) any amount paid in the taxable year for tangible property if the amount specified under this paragraph (f)(1) meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this section. However, section 263A and the regulations under section 263A require taxpayers to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs of property produced by the taxpayer (for example, property improved by the taxpayer) and property acquired for resale.
(i)
Taxpayer with applicable financial statement.
A taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor may not capitalize under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) or § 1.263(a)-3(d) nor treat as a material or supply under § 1.162-3(a) any amount paid in the taxable year for property described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if—
(A) The taxpayer has an applicable financial statement (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section);
(B) The taxpayer has at the beginning of the taxable year written accounting procedures treating as an expense for non-tax purposes—
(
1
) Amounts paid for property costing less than a specified dollar amount; or
(
2
) Amounts paid for property with an economic useful life (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)(4)) of 12 months or less;
(C) The taxpayer treats the amount paid for the property as an expense on its applicable financial statement in accordance with its written accounting procedures; and
(D) The amount paid for the property does not exceed $5,000 per invoice (or per item as substantiated by the invoice) or other amount as identified in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(ii)
Taxpayer without applicable financial statement.
A taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor may not capitalize under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) or § 1.263(a)-3(d) nor treat as a material or supply under § 1.162-3(a) any amount paid in the taxable year for property described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if—
(A) The taxpayer does not have an applicable financial statement (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section);
(B) The taxpayer has at the beginning of the taxable year accounting procedures treating as an expense for non-tax purposes—
(
1
) Amounts paid for property costing less than a specified dollar amount; or
(
2
) Amounts paid for property with an economic useful life (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)(4)) of 12 months or less;
(C) The taxpayer treats the amount paid for the property as an expense on its books and records in accordance with these accounting procedures; and
(D) The amount paid for the property does not exceed $500 per invoice (or per item as substantiated by the invoice) or other amount as identified in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iii)
Taxpayer with both an applicable financial statement and a non-qualifying financial statement.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), if a taxpayer has an applicable financial statement defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section in addition to a financial statement that does not meet requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to qualify to elect the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f).
(2)
Exceptions to de minimis safe harbor.
The de minimis safe harbor in paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to the following:
(i) Amounts paid for property that is or is intended to be included in inventory property;
(ii) Amounts paid for land;
(iii) Amounts paid for rotable, temporary, and standby emergency spare
parts that the taxpayer elects to capitalize and depreciate under § 1.162-3(d); and
(iv) Amounts paid for rotable and temporary spare parts that the taxpayer accounts for under the optional method of accounting for rotable parts pursuant to § 1.162-3(e).
(3)
Additional rules
—(i)
Transaction and other additional costs.
A taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1) of this section is not required to include in the cost of the tangible property the additional costs of acquiring or producing such property if these costs are not included in the same invoice as the tangible property. However, the taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must include in the cost of such property all additional costs (for example, delivery fees, installation services, or similar costs) if these additional costs are included on the same invoice with the tangible property. For purposes of this paragraph, if the invoice includes amounts paid for multiple tangible properties and such invoice includes additional invoice costs related to these multiple properties, then the taxpayer must allocate the additional invoice costs to each property using a reasonable method, and each property, including allocable labor and overhead, must meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is applicable. Reasonable allocation methods include, but are not limited to specific identification, a pro rata allocation, or a weighted average method based on the property's relative cost. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(i), additional costs consist of the costs of facilitating the acquisition or production of such tangible property under § 1.263(a)-2(f) and the costs for work performed prior to the date that the tangible property is placed in service under § 1.263(a)-2(d).
(ii)
Materials and supplies.
If a taxpayer elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor provided under this paragraph (f), then the taxpayer must also apply the de minimis safe harbor to amounts paid for all materials and supplies (as defined under § 1.162-3) that meet the requirements of § 1.263(a)-1(f). See paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section for treatment of materials and supplies under the de minimis safe harbor.
(iii)
Sale or disposition.
Property to which a taxpayer applies the de minimis safe harbor contained in this paragraph (f) is not treated upon sale or other disposition as a capital asset under section 1221 or as property used in the trade or business under section 1231.
(iv)
Treatment of de minimis amounts.
An amount paid for property to which a taxpayer properly applies the de minimis safe harbor contained in this paragraph (f) is not treated as a capital expenditure under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) or § 1.263(a)-3(d) or as a material and supply under § 1.162-3, and may be deducted under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amount is paid provided the amount otherwise constitutes an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in carrying on a trade or business.
(v)
Coordination with section 263A.
Amounts paid for tangible property described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if the amounts paid for tangible property comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of other property produced by the taxpayer or property acquired for resale. See, for example, § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(R) requiring taxpayers to capitalize the cost of tools and equipment allocable to property produced or property acquired for resale.
(vi)
Written accounting procedures for groups of entities.
If the taxpayer's financial results are reported on the applicable financial statement (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) for a group of entities then, for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the group's applicable financial statement may be treated as the applicable financial statement of the taxpayer, and for purposes of paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(B) and (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section, the written accounting procedures provided for the group and utilized for the group's applicable financial statement may be treated as the written accounting procedures of the taxpayer.
(vii)
Combined expensing accounting procedures.
For purposes of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(1)(ii) of this section, if
the taxpayer has, at the beginning of the taxable year, accounting procedures treating as an expense for non-tax purposes amounts paid for property costing less than a specified dollar amount and amounts paid for property with an economic useful life (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)(4)) of 12 months or less, then a taxpayer electing to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) must apply the provisions of this paragraph (f) to amounts qualifying under either accounting procedure.
(4)
Definition of applicable financial statement.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the taxpayer's applicable financial statement (AFS) is the taxpayer's financial statement listed in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section that has the highest priority (including within paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section). The financial statements are, in descending priority—
(i) A financial statement required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the 10-K or the Annual Statement to Shareholders);
(ii) A certified audited financial statement that is accompanied by the report of an independent certified public accountant (or in the case of a foreign entity, by the report of a similarly qualified independent professional) that is used for—
(A) Credit purposes;
(B) Reporting to shareholders, partners, or similar persons; or
(C) Any other substantial non-tax purpose; or
(iii) A financial statement (other than a tax return) required to be provided to the federal or a state government or any federal or state agency (other than the SEC or the Internal Revenue Service).
(5)
Time and manner of election.
A taxpayer that makes the election under this paragraph (f) must make the election for all amounts paid during the taxable year for property described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, as applicable. A taxpayer makes the election by attaching a statement to the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which these amounts are paid. Sections 301.9100-1 through 301.9100-3 of this chapter provide the rules governing extensions of the time to make regulatory elections. The statement must be titled “Section 1.263(a)-1(f) de minimis safe harbor election” and include the taxpayer's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and a statement that the taxpayer is making the de minimis safe harbor election under § 1.263(a)-1(f). In the case of a consolidated group filing a consolidated income tax return, the election is made for each member of the consolidated group by the common parent, and the statement must also include the names and taxpayer identification numbers of each member for which the election is made. In the case of an S corporation or a partnership, the election is made by the S corporation or the partnership and not by the shareholders or partners. An election may not be made through the filing of an application for change in accounting method or, before obtaining the Commissioner's consent to make a late election, by filing an amended Federal tax return. A taxpayer may not revoke an election made under this paragraph (f). The manner of electing the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) may be modified through guidance of general applicability (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(6)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a taxpayer acts to manipulate transactions with the intent to achieve a tax benefit or to avoid the application of the limitations provided under paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(B)(
1
), (f)(1)(i)(D), (f)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
), and (f)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of this section. For example, a taxpayer is deemed to act to manipulate transactions with an intent to avoid the purposes and requirements of this section if—
(i) The taxpayer applies the de minimis safe harbor to amounts substantiated with invoices created to componentize property that is generally acquired or produced by the taxpayer (or other taxpayers in the same or similar trade or business) as a single unit of tangible property; and
(ii) This property, if treated as a single unit, would exceed any of the limitations provided under paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(B)(
1
), (f)(1)(i)(D), (f)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
), and (f)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, as applicable.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). Unless otherwise provided, assume that section 263A does not apply to the amounts described.

# Example 1. De minimis safe harbor; taxpayer without AFS.
In Year 1, A purchases 10 printers at $250 each for a total cost of $2,500 as indicated by the invoice. Assume that each printer is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). A does not have an AFS. A has accounting procedures in place at the beginning of Year 1 to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $500, and A treats the amounts paid for the printers as an expense on its books and records. The amounts paid for the printers meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. If A elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) in Year 1, A may not capitalize the amounts paid for the 10 printers or any other amounts meeting the criteria for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1). Instead, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, A may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 2. De minimis safe harbor; taxpayer without AFS.
In Year 1, B purchases 10 computers at $600 each for a total cost of $6,000 as indicated by the invoice. Assume that each computer is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). B does not have an AFS. B has accounting procedures in place at the beginning of Year 1 to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $1,000 and B treats the amounts paid for the computers as an expense on its books and records. The amounts paid for the printers do not meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section because the amount paid for the property exceeds $500 per invoice (or per item as substantiated by the invoice). B may not apply the de minimis safe harbor election to the amounts paid for the 10 computers under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

# Example 3. De minimis safe harbor; taxpayer with AFS.
C is a member of a consolidated group for Federal income tax purposes. C's financial results are reported on the consolidated applicable financial statements for the affiliated group. C's affiliated group has a written accounting policy at the beginning of Year 1, which is followed by C, to expense amounts paid for property costing $5,000 or less. In Year 1, C pays $6,250,000 to purchase 1,250 computers at $5,000 each. C receives an invoice from its supplier indicating the total amount due ($6,250,000) and the price per item ($5,000). Assume that each computer is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). The amounts paid for the computers meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. If C elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) for Year 1, C may not capitalize the amounts paid for the 1,250 computers or any other amounts meeting the criteria for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Instead, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, C may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 4. De minimis safe harbor; taxpayer with AFS.
D is a member of a consolidated group for Federal income tax purposes. D's financial results are reported on the consolidated applicable financial statements for the affiliated group. D's affiliated group has a written accounting policy at the beginning of Year 1, which is followed by D, to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $15,000. In Year 1, D pays $4,800,000 to purchase 800 elliptical machines at $6,000 each. D receives an invoice from its supplier indicating the total amount due ($4,800,000) and the price per item ($6,000). Assume that each elliptical machine is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). D may not apply the de minimis safe harbor election to the amounts paid for the 800 elliptical machines under paragraph (f)(1) of this section because the amount paid for the property exceeds $5,000 per invoice (or per item as substantiated by the invoice).

# Example 5. De minimis safe harbor; additional invoice costs.
E is a member of a consolidated group for Federal income tax purposes. E's financial results are reported on the consolidated applicable financial statements for the affiliated group. E's affiliated group has a written accounting policy at the beginning of Year 1, which is followed by E, to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $5,000. In Year 1, E pays $45,000 for the purchase and installation of wireless routers in each of its 10 office locations. Assume that each wireless router is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). E receives an invoice from its supplier indicating the total amount due ($45,000), including the material price per item ($2,500), and total delivery and installation ($20,000). E allocates the additional invoice costs to the materials on a pro rata basis, bringing the cost of each router to $4,500 ($2,500 materials + $2,000 labor and overhead). The amounts paid for each router,
including the allocable additional invoice costs, meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. If E elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) for Year 1, E may not capitalize the amounts paid for the 10 routers (including the additional invoice costs) or any other amounts meeting the criteria for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Instead, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, E may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 6. De minimis safe harbor; non-invoice additional costs.
F is a corporation that provides consulting services to its customer. F does not have an AFS, but F has accounting procedures in place at the beginning of Year 1 to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $500. In Year 1, F pays $600 to an interior designer to shop for, evaluate, and make recommendations regarding purchasing new furniture for F's conference room. As a result of the interior designer's recommendations, F acquires a conference table for $500 and 10 chairs for $300 each. In Year 1, F receives an invoice from the interior designer for $600 for his services, and F receives a separate invoice from the furniture supplier indicating a total amount due of $500 for the table and $300 for each chair. For Year 1, F treats the amount paid for the table and each chair as an expense on its books and records, and F elects to use the de minimis safe harbor for amounts paid for tangible property that qualify under the safe harbor. The amount paid to the interior designer is a cost of facilitating the acquisition of the table and chairs under § 1.263(a)-2(f). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, F is not required to include in the cost of tangible property the additional costs of acquiring such property if these costs are not included in the same invoice as the tangible property. Thus, F is not required to include a pro rata allocation of the amount paid to the interior designer to determine the application of the de minimis safe harbor to the table and the chairs. Accordingly, the amounts paid by F for the table and each chair meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, and F may not capitalize the amounts paid for the table or each chair under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, F is not required to capitalize the amounts paid to the interior designer as a cost that facilitates the acquisition of tangible property under § 1.263(a)-2(f)(3)(i). Instead, F may deduct the amounts paid for the table, chairs, and interior designer under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 7. De minimis safe harbor; 12-month economic useful life.
G operates a restaurant. In Year 1, G purchases 10 hand-held point-of-service devices at $300 each for a total cost of $3,000 as indicated by invoice. G also purchases 3 tablet computers at $500 each for a total cost of $1,500 as indicated by invoice. Assume each point-of-service device and each tablet computer has an economic useful life of 12 months or less, beginning when they are used in G's business. Assume that each device and each tablet is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). G does not have an AFS, but G has accounting procedures in place at the beginning of Year 1 to expense amounts paid for property costing $300 or less and to expense amounts paid for property with an economic useful life of 12 months or less. Thus, G expenses the amounts paid for the hand-held devices on its books and records because each device costs $300. G also expenses the amounts paid for the tablet computers on its books and records because the computers have an economic useful life of 12 months of less, beginning when they are used. The amounts paid for the hand-held devices and the tablet computers meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. If G elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) in Year 1, G may not capitalize the amounts paid for the hand-held devices, the tablet computers, or any other amounts meeting the criteria for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Instead, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, G may deduct the amounts paid for the hand-held devices and tablet computers under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 8. De minimis safe harbor; limitation.
Assume the facts as in
Example 7,
except G purchases the 3 tablet computers at $600 each for a total cost of $1,800. The amounts paid for the tablet computers do not meet the de minimis rule safe harbor under paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(3)(vii) of this section because the cost of each computer exceeds $500. Therefore, the amounts paid for the tablet computers may not be deducted under the safe harbor.

# Example 9. De minimis safe harbor; materials and supplies.
H is a corporation that provides consulting services to its customers. H has an AFS and a written accounting policy at the beginning of the taxable year to expense amounts paid for property costing $5,000 or less. In Year 1, H purchases 1,000 computers
at $500 each for a total cost of $500,000. Assume that each computer is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e) and is not a material or supply under § 1.162-3. In addition, H purchases 200 office chairs at $100 each for a total cost of $20,000 and 250 customized briefcases at $80 each for a total cost of $20,000. Assume that each office chair and each briefcase is a material or supply under § 1.162-3(c)(1). H treats the amounts paid for the computers, office chairs, and briefcases as expenses on its AFS. The amounts paid for computers, office chairs, and briefcases meet the requirements for the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. If H elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under this paragraph (f) in Year 1, H may not capitalize the amounts paid for the 1,000 computers, the 200 office chairs, and the 250 briefcases under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. H may deduct the amounts paid for the computers, the office chairs, and the briefcases under § 1.162-1 in the taxable year the amounts are paid provided the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.

# Example 10. De minimis safe harbor; coordination with section 263A.
J is a member of a consolidated group for Federal income tax purposes. J's financial results are reported on the consolidated AFS for the affiliated group. J's affiliated group has a written accounting policy at the beginning of Year 1, which is followed by J, to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $1,000 or that has an economic useful life of 12 months or less. In Year 1, J acquires jigs, dies, molds, and patterns for use in the manufacture of J's products. Assume each jig, die, mold, and pattern is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e) and costs less than $1,000. In Year 1, J begins using the jigs, dies, molds and patterns to manufacture its products. Assume these items are materials and supplies under § 1.162-3(c)(1)(iii), and J elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to amounts qualifying under the safe harbor in Year 1. Under paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section, the amounts paid for the jigs, dies, molds, and patterns may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if the amounts paid for these tangible properties comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of other property produced by the taxpayer or property acquired for resale.

# Example 11. De minimis safe harbor; anti-abuse rule.
K is a corporation that provides hauling services to its customers. In Year 1, K decides to purchase a truck to use in its business. K does not have an AFS. K has accounting procedures in place at the beginning of Year 1 to expense amounts paid for property costing less than $500. K arranges to purchase a used truck for a total of $1,500. Prior to the acquisition, K requests the seller to provide multiple invoices for different parts of the truck. Accordingly, the seller provides K with four invoices during Year 1—one invoice of $500 for the cab, one invoice of $500 for the engine, one invoice of $300 for the trailer, and a fourth invoice of $200 for the tires. K treats the amounts paid under each invoice as an expense on its books and records. K elects to apply the de minimis safe harbor under paragraph (f) of this section in Year 1 and does not capitalize the amounts paid for each invoice pursuant to the safe harbor. Under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, K has applied the de minimis rule to amounts substantiated with invoices created to componentize property that is generally acquired as a single unit of tangible property in the taxpayer's type of business, and this property, if treated as single unit, would exceed the limitations provided under the de minimis rule. Accordingly, K is deemed to manipulate the transaction to acquire the truck with the intent to avoid the purposes of this paragraph (f). As a result, K may not apply the de minimis rule to these amounts and is subject to appropriate adjustments.
(g)
Accounting method changes.
Except for paragraph (f) of this section (the de minimis safe harbor election), a change to comply with this section is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the accompanying regulations apply. A taxpayer seeking to change to a method of accounting permitted in this section must secure the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with § 1.446-1(e) and follow the administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change its accounting method.

§ 1.263(a)-2
Amounts paid to acquire or produce tangible property.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules for applying section 263(a) to amounts paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal property. Paragraph (b) of this section contains definitions. Paragraph (c) of this section contains the rules for coordinating this section with other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Paragraph (d) of this section provides the general requirement to capitalize amounts paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal property. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the requirement to capitalize amounts paid to defend or perfect title to real or personal property. Paragraph (f) of this section provides the rules for determining the extent to which taxpayers must capitalize transaction costs related to the acquisition of tangible property. Paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section address the treatment and recovery of capital expenditures. Paragraph (i) of this section provides for changes in methods of accounting to comply with this section, and paragraph (j) of this section provides the effective and applicability dates for the rules under this section.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Amount paid.
In the case of a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, the terms
amount paid
and
payment
mean a liability incurred (within the meaning of § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)). A liability may not be taken into account under this section prior to the taxable year during which the liability is incurred.
(2)
Personal property
means tangible personal property as defined in § 1.48-1(c).
(3)
Real property
means land and improvements thereto, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components of the buildings or structures) that are not personal property as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Any property that constitutes other tangible property under § 1.48-1(d) is treated as real property for purposes of this section. Local law is not controlling in determining whether property is real property for purposes of this section.
(4)
Produce
means construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, create, raise, or grow. This definition is intended to have the same meaning as the definition used for purposes of section 263A(g)(1) and § 1.263A-2(a)(1)(i), except that improvements are excluded from the definition in this paragraph (b)(4) and are separately defined and addressed in § 1.263(a)-3.
(c)
Coordination with other provisions of the Code
—(1)
In general.
Nothing in this section changes the treatment of any amount that is specifically provided for under any provision of the Code or the Treasury Regulations other than section 162(a) or section 212
and the regulations under those sections. For example, see section 263A requiring taxpayers to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs of property produced by the taxpayer and property acquired for resale. See also section 195 requiring taxpayers to capitalize certain costs as start-up expenditures.
(2)
Materials and supplies.
Nothing in this section changes the treatment of amounts paid to acquire or produce property that is properly treated as materials and supplies under § 1.162-3.
(d)
Acquired or produced tangible property

Requirement to capitalize.
Except as provided in § 1.162-3 (relating to materials and supplies) and in § 1.263(a)-1(f) (providing a de minimis safe harbor election), a taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal property (as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e)), including leasehold improvements, land and land improvements, buildings, machinery and equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Section 1.263(a)-3(f) provides the rules for determining whether amounts are for leasehold improvements. Amounts paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal property include the invoice price, transaction costs as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, and costs for work performed prior to the date that the unit of property is placed in service by the taxpayer (without regard to any applicable convention under section 168(d)). A taxpayer also must capitalize amounts paid to acquire real or personal property for resale.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d). Unless otherwise provided, assume that the taxpayer does not elect the de minimis safe harbor under § 1.263(a)-1(f) and that the property is not acquired for resale under section 263A.

# Example 1. Acquisition of personal property.
A purchases new cash registers for use in its retail store located in leased space in a shopping mall. Assume each cash register is a unit of property as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e) and is not a material or supply under § 1.162-3. A must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amount paid to acquire each cash register.

# Example 2. Acquisition of personal property that is a material or supply; coordination with § 1.162-3.
B operates a fleet of aircraft. In Year 1, B acquires a stock of component parts, which it intends to use to maintain and repair its aircraft. Assume that each component part is a material or supply under § 1.162-3(c)(1) and B does not make elections under § 1.162-3(d) to treat the materials and supplies as capital expenditures. In Year 2, B uses the component parts in the repair and maintenance of its aircraft. Because the parts are materials and supplies under § 1.162-3, B is not required to capitalize the amounts paid for the parts under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Rather, to determine the treatment of these amounts, B must apply the rules under § 1.162-3, governing the treatment of materials and supplies.

# Example 3. Acquisition of unit of personal property; coordination with § 1.162-3.
C operates a rental business that rents out a variety of small individual items to customers (rental items). C maintains a supply of rental items on hand to replace worn or damaged items. C purchases a large quantity of rental items to be used in its business. Assume that each of these rental items is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e). Also assume that a portion of the rental items are materials and supplies under § 1.162-3(c)(1). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must capitalize the amounts paid for the rental items that are not materials and supplies under § 1.162-3(c)(1). However, C must apply the rules in § 1.162-3 to determine the treatment of the rental items that are materials and supplies under § 1.162-3(c)(1).

# Example 4. Acquisition or production cost.
D purchases and produces jigs, dies, molds, and patterns for use in the manufacture of D's products. Assume that each of these items is a unit of property as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e) and is not a material and supply under § 1.162-3(c)(1). D is required to capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amounts paid to acquire and produce the jigs, dies, molds, and patterns.

# Example 5. Acquisition of land.
F purchases a parcel of undeveloped real estate. F must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amount paid to acquire the real estate. See paragraph (f) of this section for the treatment of amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of real property.

# Example 6. Acquisition of building.
G purchases a building. G must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amount paid to acquire the building. See paragraph (f) of this section for the treatment of amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of real property.

# Example 7. Acquisition of property for resale and production of property for sale; coordination with section 263A.
H purchases goods for resale and produces other goods for sale. H must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amounts paid to acquire and produce the goods. See section 263A for the
amounts required to be capitalized to the property produced or to the property acquired for resale.

# Example 8. Production of building; coordination with section 263A.
J constructs a building. J must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amount paid to construct the building. See section 263A for the costs required to be capitalized to the real property produced by J.

# Example 9. Acquisition of assets constituting a trade or business.
K owns tangible and intangible assets that constitute a trade or business. L purchases all the assets of K in a taxable transaction. L must capitalize under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the amount paid for the tangible assets of K. See § 1.263(a)-4 for the treatment of amounts paid to acquire or create intangibles and § 1.263(a)-5 for the treatment of amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of assets that constitute a trade or business. See section 1060 for special allocation rules for certain asset acquisitions.

# Example 10. Work performed prior to placing the property in service.
In Year 1, M purchases a building for use as a business office. Prior to placing the building in service, M pays amounts to repair cement steps, refinish wood floors, patch holes in walls, and paint the interiors and exteriors of the building. In Year 2, M places the building in service and begins using the building as its business office. Assume that the work that M performs does not constitute an improvement to the building or its structural components under § 1.263(a)-3. Under § 1.263-3(e)(2)(i), the building and its structural components is a single unit of property. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amounts paid must be capitalized as amounts to acquire the building unit of property because they were for work performed prior to M's placing the building in service.

# Example 11. Work performed prior to placing the property in service.
In January Year 1, N purchases a new machine for use in an existing production line of its manufacturing business. Assume that the machine is a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-3(e) and is not a material or supply under § 1.162-3. N pays amounts to install the machine, and after the machine is installed, N pays amounts to perform a critical test on the machine to ensure that it will operate in accordance with quality standards. On November 1, Year 1, the critical test is complete, and N places the machine in service on the production line. N pays amounts to perform periodic quality control testing after the machine is placed in service. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amounts paid for the installation and the critical test performed before the machine is placed in service must be capitalized by N as amounts to acquire the machine. However, amounts paid for periodic quality control testing after N placed the machine in service are not required to be capitalized as amounts paid to acquire the machine.
(e)
Defense or perfection of title to property
—(1)
In general.
Amounts paid to defend or perfect title to real or personal property are amounts paid to acquire or produce property within the meaning of this section and must be capitalized.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1. Amounts paid to contest condemnation
X owns real property located in County. County files an eminent domain complaint condemning a portion of X's property to use as a roadway. X hires an attorney to contest the condemnation. The amounts that X paid to the attorney must be capitalized because they were to defend X's title to the property.

# Example 2. Amounts paid to invalidate ordinance.
Y is in the business of quarrying and supplying for sale sand and stone in a certain municipality. Several years after Y establishes its business, the municipality in which it is located passes an ordinance that prohibits the operation of Y's business. Y incurs attorney's fees in a successful prosecution of a suit to invalidate the municipal ordinance. Y prosecutes the suit to preserve its business activities and not to defend Y's title in the property. Therefore, the attorney's fees that Y paid are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

# Example 3. Amounts paid to challenge building line.
The board of public works of a municipality establishes a building line across Z's business property, adversely affecting the value of the property. Z incurs legal fees in unsuccessfully litigating the establishment of the building line. The amounts Z paid to the attorney must be capitalized because they were to defend Z's title to the property.
(f)
Transaction costs
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.263(a)-1(f)(3)(i) (for purposes of the de minimis safe harbor), a taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of real or personal property. See § 1.263(a)-5 for the treatment of amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of assets that constitute a trade or business. See § 1.167(a)-5 for allocations of facilitative costs between depreciable and non-depreciable property.
(2)
Scope of facilitate
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, an amount is paid to facilitate the acquisition of real or personal property if the amount is paid in the process of investigating or otherwise
pursuing the acquisition. Whether an amount is paid in the process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the acquisition is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances. In determining whether an amount is paid to facilitate an acquisition, the fact that the amount would (or would not) have been paid but for the acquisition is relevant but is not determinative. Amounts paid to facilitate an acquisition include, but are not limited to, inherently facilitative amounts specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Inherently facilitative amounts.
An amount is paid in the process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the acquisition of real or personal property if the amount is inherently facilitative. An amount is inherently facilitative if the amount is paid for—
(A) Transporting the property (for example, shipping fees and moving costs);
(B) Securing an appraisal or determining the value or price of property;
(C) Negotiating the terms or structure of the acquisition and obtaining tax advice on the acquisition;
(D) Application fees, bidding costs, or similar expenses;
(E) Preparing and reviewing the documents that effectuate the acquisition of the property (for example, preparing the bid, offer, sales contract, or purchase agreement);
(F) Examining and evaluating the title of property;
(G) Obtaining regulatory approval of the acquisition or securing permits related to the acquisition, including application fees;
(H) Conveying property between the parties, including sales and transfer taxes, and title registration costs;
(I) Finders' fees or brokers' commissions, including contingency fees (defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section);
(J) Architectural, geological, survey, engineering, environmental, or inspection services pertaining to particular properties; or
(K) Services provided by a qualified intermediary or other facilitator of an exchange under section 1031.
(iii)
Special rule for acquisitions of real property
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section (relating to inherently facilitative amounts), an amount paid by the taxpayer in the process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the acquisition of real property does not facilitate the acquisition if it relates to activities performed in the process of determining whether to acquire real property and which real property to acquire.
(B)
Acquisitions of real and personal property in a single transaction.
An amount paid by the taxpayer in the process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the acquisition of personal property facilitates the acquisition of such personal property, even if such property is acquired in a single transaction that also includes the acquisition of real property subject to the special rule set out in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. A taxpayer may use a reasonable allocation method to determine which costs facilitate the acquisition of personal property and which costs relate to the acquisition of real property and are subject to the special rule of paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
(iv)
Employee compensation and overhead costs
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, amounts paid for employee compensation (within the meaning of § 1.263(a)-4(e)(4)(ii)) and overhead are treated as amounts that do not facilitate the acquisition of real or personal property. However, section 263A provides rules for employee compensation and overhead costs required to be capitalized to property produced by the taxpayer or to property acquired for resale.
(B)
Election to capitalize.
A taxpayer may elect to treat amounts paid for employee compensation or overhead as amounts that facilitate the acquisition of property. The election is made separately for each acquisition and applies to employee compensation or overhead, or both. For example, a taxpayer may elect to treat overhead, but not employee compensation, as amounts that facilitate the acquisition of property. A taxpayer makes the election by treating the amounts to which the election applies as amounts that facilitate the acquisition in the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year during which the amounts are
paid. Sections 301.9100-1 through 301.9100-3 of this chapter provide the rules governing extensions of the time to make regulatory elections. In the case of an S corporation or a partnership, the election is made by the S corporation or by the partnership, and not by the shareholders or partners. A taxpayer may revoke an election made under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) with respect to each acquisition only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke this election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The manner of electing and revoking the election to capitalize under this paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) may be modified through guidance of general applicability (see §§ 606.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this section). An election may not be made or revoked through the filing of an application for change in accounting method or, before obtaining the Commissioner's consent to make the late election or to revoke the election, by filing an amended Federal tax return.
(3)
Treatment of transaction costs
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided under § 1.263(a)-1(f)(3)(i) (for purposes of the de minimis safe harbor), all amounts paid to facilitate the acquisition of real or personal property are capital expenditures. Facilitative amounts allocable to real or personal property must be included in the basis of the property acquired.
(ii)
Treatment of inherently facilitative amounts allocable to property not acquired.
Inherently facilitative amounts allocable to real or personal property are capital expenditures related to such property, even if the property is not eventually acquired. Except for contingency fees as defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, inherently facilitative amounts allocable to real or personal property not acquired may be allocated to those properties and recovered as appropriate in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations (for example, sections 165, 167, or 168). See paragraph (h) of this section for the recovery of capitalized amounts.
(iii)
Contingency fees.
For purposes of this section, a contingency fee is an amount paid that is contingent on the successful closing of the acquisition of real or personal property. Contingency fees must be included in the basis of the property acquired and may not be allocated to the property not acquired.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (f) of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer does not elect the de minimis safe harbor under § 1.263(a)-1(f):

# Example 1. Broker's fees to facilitate an acquisition
A decides to purchase a building in which to relocate its offices and hires a real estate broker to find a suitable building. A pays fees to the broker to find property for A to acquire. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(I) of this section, A must capitalize the amounts paid to the broker because these costs are inherently facilitative of the acquisition of real property.

# Example 2. Inspection and survey costs to facilitate an acquisition
B decides to purchase Building X and pays amounts to third-party contractors for a termite inspection and an environmental survey of Building X. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(J) of this section, B must capitalize the amounts paid for the inspection and the survey of the building because these costs are inherently facilitative of the acquisition of real property.

# Example 3. Moving costs to facilitate an acquisition
C purchases all the assets of D and, in connection with the purchase, hires a transportation company to move storage tanks from D's plant to C's plant. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, C must capitalize the amount paid to move the storage tanks from D's plant to C's plant because this cost is inherently facilitative to the acquisition of personal property.

# Example 4. Geological and geophysical costs; coordination with other provisions
E is in the business of exploring, purchasing, and developing properties in the United States for the production of oil and gas. E considers acquiring a particular property but first incurs costs for the services of an engineering firm to perform geological and geophysical studies to determine if the property is suitable for oil or gas production. Assume that the amounts that E paid to the engineering firm constitute geological and geophysical expenditures under section 167(h). Although the amounts that E paid for the geological and geophysical services are inherently facilitative to the acquisition of real property under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(J) of this section, E is not required to include those amounts in
the basis of the real property acquired. Rather, under paragraph (c) of this section, E must capitalize these costs separately and amortize such costs as required under section 167(h) (addressing the amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures).

# Example 5. Scope of facilitate
F is in the business of providing legal services to clients. F is interested in acquiring a new conference table for its office. F hires and incurs fees for an interior designer to shop for, evaluate, and make recommendations to F regarding which new table to acquire. Under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, F must capitalize the amounts paid to the interior designer to provide these services because they are paid in the process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the acquisition of personal property.

# Example 6. Transaction costs allocable to multiple properties
G, a retailer, wants to acquire land for the purpose of building a new distribution facility for its products. G considers various properties on Highway X in State Y. G incurs fees for the services of an architect to advise and evaluate the suitability of the sites for the type of facility that G intends to construct on the selected site. G must capitalize the architect fees as amounts paid to acquire land because these amounts are inherently facilitative to the acquisition of land under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(J) of this section.

# Example 7. Transaction costs; coordination with section 263A
H, a retailer, wants to acquire land for the purpose of building a new distribution facility for its products. H considers various properties on Highway X in State Y. H incurs fees for the services of an architect to prepare preliminary floor plans for a building that H could construct at any of the sites. Under these facts, the architect's fees are not facilitative to the acquisition of land under paragraph (f) of this section. Therefore, H is not required to capitalize the architect fees as amounts paid to acquire land. However, the amounts paid for the architect's fees may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if these amounts comprise the direct or allocable indirect cost of property produced by H, such as the building.

# Example 8. Special rule for acquisitions of real property
J owns several retail stores. J decides to examine the feasibility of opening a new store in City X. In October, Year 1, J hires and incurs costs for a development consulting firm to study City X and perform market surveys, evaluate zoning and environmental requirements, and make preliminary reports and recommendations as to areas that J should consider for purposes of locating a new store. In December, Year 1, J continues to consider whether to purchase real property in City X and which property to acquire. J hires, and incurs fees for, an appraiser to perform appraisals on two different sites to determine a fair offering price for each site. In March, Year 2, J decides to acquire one of these two sites for the location of its new store. At the same time, J determines not to acquire the other site. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, J is not required to capitalize amounts paid to the development consultant in Year 1 because the amounts relate to activities performed in the process of determining whether to acquire real property and which real property to acquire, and the amounts are not inherently facilitative costs under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. However, J must capitalize amounts paid to the appraiser in Year 1 because the appraisal costs are inherently facilitative costs under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. In Year 2, J must include the appraisal costs allocable to property acquired in the basis of the property acquired. In addition, J may recover the appraisal costs allocable to the property not acquired in accordance with paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (h) of this section. See, for example, § 1.165-2 for losses on the permanent withdrawal of non-depreciable property.

# Example 9. Contingency fee
K owns several restaurant properties. K decides to open a new restaurant in City X. In October, Year 1, K hires a real estate consultant to identify potential property upon which K may locate its restaurant, and is obligated to compensate the consultant upon the acquisition of property. The real estate consultant identifies three properties, and K decides to acquire one of those properties. Upon closing of the acquisition of that property, K pays the consultant its fee. The amount paid to the consultant constitutes a contingency fee under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section because the payment is contingent on the successful closing of the acquisition of property. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, K must include the amount paid to the consultant in the basis of the property acquired. K is not permitted to allocate the amount paid between the properties acquired and not acquired.

# Example 10. Employee compensation and overhead
L, a freight carrier, maintains an acquisition department whose sole function is to arrange for the purchase of vehicles and aircraft from manufacturers or other parties to be used in its freight carrying business. As provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, L is not required to capitalize any portion of the compensation paid to employees in its acquisition department or any portion of its overhead allocable to its acquisition department. However, under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, L may elect to capitalize the compensation and/or overhead costs allocable to the acquisition of a vehicle or aircraft by treating these amounts as costs that facilitate the acquisition of that property in its timely filed original Federal tax return for the year the amounts are paid.
(g)
Treatment of capital expenditures.
Amounts required to be capitalized under this section are capital expenditures and must be taken into account through a charge to capital account or basis, or in the case of property that is inventory in the hands of a taxpayer, through inclusion in inventory costs.
(h)
Recovery of capitalized amounts
—(1)
In general.
Amounts that are capitalized under this section are recovered through depreciation, cost of goods sold, or by an adjustment to basis at the time the property is placed in service, sold, used, or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer. Cost recovery is determined by the applicable provisions of the Code and regulations relating to the use, sale, or disposition of property.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of paragraph (h)(1) of this section. For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer does not elect the de minimis safe harbor under § 1.263(a)-1(f).

# Example 1. Recovery when property placed in service
X owns a 10-unit apartment building. The refrigerator in one of the apartments stops functioning, and X purchases a new refrigerator to replace the old one. X pays for the acquisition, delivery, and installation of the new refrigerator. Assume that the refrigerator is the unit of property, as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e), and is not a material or supply under § 1.162-3. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X is required to capitalize the amounts paid for the acquisition, delivery, and installation of the refrigerator. Under this paragraph (h), the capitalized amounts are recovered through depreciation, which begins when the refrigerator is placed in service by X.

# Example 2. Recovery when property used in the production of property
Y operates a plant where it manufactures widgets. Y purchases a tractor loader to move raw materials into and around the plant for use in the manufacturing process. Assume that the tractor loader is a unit of property, as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e), and is not a material or supply under § 1.162-3. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Y is required to capitalize the amounts paid to acquire the tractor loader. Under this paragraph (h), the capitalized amounts are recovered through depreciation, which begins when Y places the tractor loader in service. However, because the tractor loader is used in the production of property, under section 263A the cost recovery (that is, the depreciation) may also be capitalized to Y's property produced, and, consequently, recovered through cost of goods sold. See § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(I).
(i)
Accounting method changes.
Unless otherwise provided under this section, a change to comply with this section is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the accompanying regulations apply. A taxpayer seeking to change to a method of accounting permitted in this section must secure the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with § 1.446-1(e) and follow the administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change its accounting method.
(j)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except for paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), and (f)(3)(ii) of this section, this section generally applies to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), and (f)(3)(ii) of this section apply to amounts paid in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(2) of this section, § 1.263(a)-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2011, applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2014.

(ii)
Transition rule for election to capitalize employee compensation and overhead costs on 2012 or 2013 returns.
If under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayer chooses to make the election to capitalize employee compensation and overhead costs under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section for amounts paid in its taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and ending on or before September 19, 2013 (applicable taxable year), and the taxpayer did not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this
section on its timely filed original Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year, the taxpayer must make the election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section for the applicable taxable year by filing an amended Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year on or before 180 days from the due date including extensions of the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year, notwithstanding that the taxpayer may not have extended the due date.
(3)
Optional application of TD 9564.
Except for § 1.263(a)-2T(f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), (f)(3)(ii), and (g), a taxpayer may choose to apply § 1.263(a)-2T as contained in TD 9564 (76 FR 81060) December 27, 2011, to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and before January 1, 2014.

(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Amount paid.
In the case of a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, the terms
amounts paid
and
payment
mean a liability incurred (within the meaning of § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)). A liability may not be taken into account under this section prior to the taxable year during which the liability is incurred.
(2)
Personal property
means tangible personal property as defined in § 1.48-1(c).
(3)
Real property
means land and improvements thereto, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components of the buildings or structures) that are not personal property as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Any property that constitutes other tangible property under § 1.48-1(d) is also treated as real property for purposes of this section. Local law is not controlling in determining whether property is real property for purposes of this section.
(4)
Owner
means the taxpayer that has the benefits and burdens of ownership of the unit of property for Federal income tax purposes.
(c)
Coordination with other provisions of the Code
—(1)
In general.
Nothing in
this section changes the treatment of any amount that is specifically provided for under any provision of the Code or the regulations other than section 162(a) or section 212 and the regulations under those sections. For example, see section 263A requiring taxpayers to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs of property produced and property acquired for resale.
(2)
Materials and supplies.
A material or supply as defined in § 1.162-3(c)(1) that is acquired and used to improve a unit of tangible property is subject to this section and is not treated as a material or supply under § 1.162-3.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c):

# Example. Railroad rolling stock
X is a railroad that properly treats amounts paid for the rehabilitation of railroad rolling stock as deductible expenses under section 263(d). X is not required to capitalize the amounts paid because nothing in this section changes the treatment of amounts specifically provided for under section 263(d).
(d)
Requirement to capitalize amounts paid for improvements.
Except as provided in paragraph (h) or paragraph (n) of this section or under § 1.263(a)-1(f), a taxpayer generally must capitalize the related amounts (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) paid to improve a unit of property owned by the taxpayer. However, paragraph (f) of this section applies to the treatment of amounts paid to improve leased property. Section 263A provides the requirement to capitalize the direct and allocable indirect costs of property produced by the taxpayer and property acquired for resale. Section 1016 provides for the addition of capitalized amounts to the basis of the property, and section 168 governs the treatment of additions or improvements for depreciation purposes. For purposes of this section, a unit of property is improved if the amounts paid for activities performed after the property is placed in service by the taxpayer—
(1) Are for a betterment to the unit of property (see paragraph (j) of this section);
(2) Restore the unit of property (see paragraph (k) of this section); or
(3) Adapt the unit of property to a new or different use (see paragraph (l) of this section).
(e)
Determining the unit of property
—(1)
In general.
The unit of property rules in this paragraph (e) apply only for purposes of section 263(a) and §§ 1.263(a)-1, 1.263(a)-2, 1.263(a)-3, and 1.162-3. Unless otherwise specified, the unit of property determination is based upon the functional interdependence standard provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. However, special rules are provided for buildings (see paragraph (e)(2) of this section), plant property (see paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section), network assets (see paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section), leased property (see paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section for leased buildings and paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section for leased property other than buildings), and improvements to property (see paragraph (e)(4) of this section). Additional rules are provided if a taxpayer has assigned different MACRS classes or depreciation methods to components of property or subsequently changes the class or depreciation method of a component or other item of property (see paragraph (e)(5) of this section). Property that is aggregated or subject to a general asset account election or accounted for in a multiple asset account (that is, pooled) may not be treated as a single unit of property.
(2)
Building
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(4), and (e)(5)(ii) of this section, in the case of a building (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1)), each building and its structural components (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2)) is a single unit of property (“building”). Paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section provides the unit of property for condominiums, paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section provides the unit of property for cooperatives, and paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section provides the unit of property for leased buildings.
(ii)
Application of improvement rules to a building.
An amount is paid to improve a building under paragraph (d) of this section if the amount is paid for an improvement under paragraphs (j), (k), or paragraph (l) of this section to any of the following:
(A)
Building structure.
A building structure consists of the building (as
defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1)), and its structural components (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2)), other than the structural components designated as buildings systems in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Building system.
Each of the following structural components (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2)), including the components thereof, constitutes a building system that is separate from the building structure, and to which the improvement rules must be applied—
(
1
) Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) systems (including motors, compressors, boilers, furnace, chillers, pipes, ducts, radiators);
(
2
) Plumbing systems (including pipes, drains, valves, sinks, bathtubs, toilets, water and sanitary sewer collection equipment, and site utility equipment used to distribute water and waste to and from the property line and between buildings and other permanent structures);
(
3
) Electrical systems (including wiring, outlets, junction boxes, lighting fixtures and associated connectors, and site utility equipment used to distribute electricity from the property line to and between buildings and other permanent structures);
(
4
) All escalators;
(
5
) All elevators;
(
6
) Fire-protection and alarm systems (including sensing devices, computer controls, sprinkler heads, sprinkler mains, associated piping or plumbing, pumps, visual and audible alarms, alarm control panels, heat and smoke detection devices, fire escapes, fire doors, emergency exit lighting and signage, and fire fighting equipment, such as extinguishers, and hoses);
(
7
) Security systems for the protection of the building and its occupants (including window and door locks, security cameras, recorders, monitors, motion detectors, security lighting, alarm systems, entry and access systems, related junction boxes, associated wiring and conduit);
(
8
) Gas distribution system (including associated pipes and equipment used to distribute gas to and from the property line and between buildings or permanent structures); and
(
9
) Other structural components identified in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) that are excepted from the building structure under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and are specifically designated as building systems under this section.
(iii)
Condominium
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer that is the owner of an individual unit in a building with multiple units (such as a condominium), the unit of property (“condominium”) is the individual unit owned by the taxpayer and the structural components (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2)) that are part of the unit.
(B)
Application of improvement rules to a condominium.
An amount is paid to improve a condominium under paragraph (d) of this section if the amount is paid for an improvement under paragraphs (j), (k), or paragraph (l) of this section to the building structure (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) that is part of the condominium or to the portion of any building system (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) that is part of the condominium. In the case of the condominium management association, the association must apply the improvement rules to the building structure or to any building system described under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Cooperative
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer that has an ownership interest in a cooperative housing corporation, the unit of property (“cooperative”) is the portion of the building in which the taxpayer has possessory rights and the structural components (as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2)) that are part of the portion of the building subject to the taxpayer's possessory rights (cooperative).
(B)
Application of improvement rules to a cooperative.
An amount is paid to improve a cooperative under paragraph (d) of this section if the amount is paid for an improvement under paragraphs (j), (k), or (l) of this section to the portion of the building structure (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) in which the taxpayer has possessory rights or to the portion of any building system (as defined in
paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) that is part of the portion of the building structure subject to the taxpayer's possessory rights. In the case of a cooperative housing corporation, the corporation must apply the improvement rules to the building structure or to any building system as described under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(v)
Leased building
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer that is a lessee of all or a portion of a building (such as an office, floor, or certain square footage), the unit of property (“leased building property”) is each building and its structural components or the portion of each building subject to the lease and the structural components associated with the leased portion.
(B)
Application of improvement rules to a leased building.
An amount is paid to improve a leased building property under paragraphs (d) and (f)(2) of this section if the amount is paid for an improvement, under paragraphs (j), (k), or (l) of this section, to any of the following:
(
1
)
Entire building.
In the case of a taxpayer that is a lessee of an entire building, the building structure (as defined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) or any building system (as defined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) that is part of the leased building.
(
2
)
Portion of a building.
In the case of a taxpayer that is a lessee of a portion of a building (such as an office, floor, or certain square footage), the portion of the building structure (as defined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) subject to the lease or the portion of any building system (as defined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) subject to the lease.
(3)
Property other than building
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4), (e)(5), and (f)(1) of this section, in the case of real or personal property other than property described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, all the components that are functionally interdependent comprise a single unit of property. Components of property are functionally interdependent if the placing in service of one component by the taxpayer is dependent on the placing in service of the other component by the taxpayer.
(ii)
Plant property
—(A)
Definition.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
plant property
means functionally interdependent machinery or equipment, other than network assets, used to perform an industrial process, such as manufacturing, generation, warehousing, distribution, automated materials handling in service industries, or other similar activities.
(B)
Unit of property for plant property.
In the case of plant property, the unit of property determined under the general rule of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is further divided into smaller units comprised of each component (or group of components) that performs a discrete and major function or operation within the functionally interdependent machinery or equipment.
(iii)
Network assets
—(A)
Definition.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
network assets
means railroad track, oil and gas pipelines, water and sewage pipelines, power transmission and distribution lines, and telephone and cable lines that are owned or leased by taxpayers in each of those respective industries. The term includes, for example, trunk and feeder lines, pole lines, and buried conduit. It does not include property that would be included as building structure or building systems under paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, nor does it include separate property that is adjacent to, but not part of a network asset, such as bridges, culverts, or tunnels.
(B)
Unit of property for network assets.
In the case of network assets, the unit of property is determined by the taxpayer's particular facts and circumstances except as otherwise provided in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). For these purposes, the functional interdependence standard provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is not determinative.
(iv)
Leased property other than buildings.
In the case of a taxpayer that is a lessee of real or personal property other than property described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the unit of
property for the leased property is determined under paragraphs (e)(3)(i),(ii), (iii), and (e)(5) of this section except that, after applying the applicable rules under those paragraphs, the unit of property may not be larger than the property subject to the lease.
(4)
Improvements to property.
An improvement to a unit of property generally is not a unit of property separate from the unit of property improved. For the unit of property for lessee improvements, see also paragraph (f)(2)(ii)) of this section. If a taxpayer elects to treat as a capital expenditure under § 1.162-3(d) the amount paid for a rotable spare part, temporary spare part, or standby emergency spare part, and such part is used in an improvement to a unit of property, then for purposes of applying paragraph (d) of this section to the unit of property improved, the part is not a unit of property separate from the unit of property improved.
(5)
Additional rules
—(i)
Year placed in service.
Notwithstanding the unit of property determination under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a component (or a group of components) of a unit property must be treated as a separate unit of property if, at the time the unit of property is initially placed in service by the taxpayer, the taxpayer has properly treated the component as being within a different class of property under section 168(e) (MACRS classes) than the class of the unit of property of which the component is a part, or the taxpayer has properly depreciated the component using a different depreciation method than the depreciation method of the unit of property of which the component is a part.
(ii)
Change in subsequent taxable year.
Notwithstanding the unit of property determination under paragraphs (e)(2), (3), (4), or (5)(i) of this section, in any taxable year after the unit of property is initially placed in service by the taxpayer, if the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service changes the treatment of that property (or any portion thereof) to a proper MACRS class or a proper depreciation method (for example, as a result of a cost segregation study or a change in the use of the property), then the taxpayer must change the unit of property determination for that property (or the portion thereof) under this section to be consistent with the change in treatment for depreciation purposes. Thus, for example, if a portion of a unit of property is properly reclassified to a MACRS class different from the MACRS class of the unit of property of which it was previously treated as a part, then the reclassified portion of the property should be treated as a separate unit of property for purposes of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e) and assume that the taxpayer has not made a general asset account election with regard to property or accounted for property in a multiple asset account. In addition, unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the additional rules in paragraph (e)(5) of this section do not apply:

# Example 1. Building systems
A owns an office building that contains a HVAC system. The HVAC system incorporates ten roof-mounted units that service different parts of the building. The roof-mounted units are not connected and have separate controls and duct work that distribute the heated or cooled air to different spaces in the building's interior. A pays an amount for labor and materials for work performed on the roof-mounted units. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, A must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a building if it is for an improvement to the building structure or any designated building system. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the entire HVAC system, including all of the roof-mounted units and their components, comprise a building system. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if an amount paid by A for work on the roof-mounted units is an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the HVAC system, A must treat this amount as an improvement to the building.

# Example 2. Building systems
B owns a building that it uses in its retail business. The building contains two elevator banks in different locations in its building. Each elevator bank contains three elevators. B pays an amount for labor and materials for work performed on the elevators. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, B must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an
amount is paid to improve a building if it is for an improvement to the building structure or any designated building system. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
5
) of this section, all six elevators, including all their components, comprise a building system. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if an amount paid by B for work on the elevators is an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the elevator system, B must treat this amount as an improvement to the building.

# Example 3. Building structure and systems; condominium
C owns a condominium unit in a condominium office building. C uses the condominium unit in its business of providing medical services. The condominium unit contains two restrooms, each of which contains a sink, a toilet, water and drainage pipes and other bathroom fixtures. C pays an amount for labor and materials to perform work on the pipes, sinks, toilets, and plumbing fixtures that are part of the condominium. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, C must treat the individual unit that it owns, including the structural components that are part of that unit, as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, an amount is paid to improve the condominium if it is for an improvement to the building structure that is part of the condominium or to a portion of any designated building system that is part of the condominium. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, the pipes, sinks, toilets, and plumbing fixtures that are part of C's condominium comprise the plumbing system for the condominium. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, if an amount paid by C for work on pipes, sinks, toilets, and plumbing fixtures is an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the portion of the plumbing system that is part of C's condominium, C must treat this amount as an improvement to the condominium.

# Example 4. Building structure and systems; property other than buildings
D, a manufacturer, owns a building adjacent to its manufacturing facility that contains office space and related facilities for D's employees that manage and administer D's manufacturing operations. The office building contains equipment, such as desks, chairs, computers, telephones, and bookshelves that are not building structure or building systems. D pays an amount to add an extension to the office building. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, D must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a building if it is for an improvement to the building structure or any designated building system. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if an amount paid by D for the addition of an extension to the office building is an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the building structure or any of the building systems, D must treat this amount as an improvement to the building. In addition, because the equipment contained within the office building constitutes property other than the building, the units of property for the office equipment are initially determined under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and are comprised of all the components that are functionally interdependent (for example, each desk, each chair, and each book shelf).

# Example 5. Plant property; discrete and major function
E is an electric utility company that operates a power plant to generate electricity. The power plant includes a structure that is not a building under § 1.48-1(e)(1), and, among other things, one pulverizer that grinds coal, a single boiler that produces steam, one turbine that converts the steam into mechanical energy, and one generator that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. In addition, the turbine contains a series of blades that cause the turbine to rotate when affected by the steam. Because the plant is composed of real and personal tangible property other than a building, the unit of property for the generating equipment is initially determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and is comprised of all the components that are functionally interdependent. Under this rule, the initial unit of property is the entire plant because the components of the plant are functionally interdependent. However, because the power plant is plant property under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the initial unit of property is further divided into smaller units of property by determining the components (or groups of components) that perform discrete and major functions within the plant. Under this paragraph, E must treat the structure, the boiler, the turbine, the generator, and the pulverizer each as a separate unit of property because each of these components performs a discrete and major function within the power plant. E may not treat components, such as the turbine blades, as separate units of property because each of these components does not perform a discrete and major function within the plant.

# Example 6. Plant property; discrete and major function
F is engaged in a uniform and linen rental business. F owns and operates a plant that utilizes many different machines and equipment in an assembly line-like process to treat, launder, and prepare rental items for its customers. F utilizes two laundering lines in its plant, each of which can operate independently. One line is used for uniforms and another line is used for linens. Both lines incorporate a sorter, boiler, washer, dryer, ironer, folder, and waste water treatment system. Because the laundering equipment contained within the plant is property
other than a building, the unit of property for the laundering equipment is initially determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and is comprised of all the components that are functionally interdependent. Under this rule, the initial units of property are each laundering line because each line is functionally independent and is comprised of components that are functionally interdependent. However, because each line is comprised of plant property under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, F must further divide these initial units of property into smaller units of property by determining the components (or groups of components) that perform discrete and major functions within the line. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, F must treat each sorter, boiler, washer, dryer, ironer, folder, and waste water treatment system in each line as a separate unit of property because each of these components performs a discrete and major function within the line.

# Example 7. Plant property; industrial process
G operates a restaurant that prepares and serves food to retail customers. Within its restaurant, G has a large piece of equipment that uses an assembly line-like process to prepare and cook tortillas that G serves only to its restaurant customers. Because the tortilla-making equipment is property other than a building, the unit of property for the equipment is initially determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and is comprised of all the components that are functionally interdependent. Under this rule, the initial unit of property is the entire tortilla-making equipment because the various components of the equipment are functionally interdependent. The equipment is not plant property under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section because the equipment is not used in an industrial process, as it performs a small-scale function in G's restaurant operations. Thus, G is not required to further divide the equipment into separate units of property based on the components that perform discrete and major functions.

# Example 8. Personal property
H owns locomotives that it uses in its railroad business. Each locomotive consists of various components, such as an engine, generators, batteries, and trucks. H acquired a locomotive with all its components. Because H's locomotive is property other than a building, the initial unit of property is determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and is comprised of the components that are functionally interdependent. Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the locomotive is a single unit of property because it consists entirely of components that are functionally interdependent.

# Example 9. Personal property
J provides legal services to its clients. J purchased a laptop computer and a printer for its employees to use in providing legal services. Because the computer and printer are property other than a building, the initial units of property are determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and are comprised of the components that are functionally interdependent. Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the computer and the printer are separate units of property because the computer and the printer are not components that are functionally interdependent (that is, the placing in service of the computer is not dependent on the placing in service of the printer).

# Example 10. Building structure and systems; leased building
K is a retailer of consumer products. K conducts its retail sales in a building that it leases from L. The leased building consists of the building structure (including the floor, walls, and roof) and various building systems, including a plumbing system, an electrical system, an HVAC system, a security system, and a fire protection and prevention system. K pays an amount for labor and materials to perform work on the HVAC system of the leased building. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(A) of this section, because K leases the entire building, K must treat the leased building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a leased building property if it is for an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the leased building structure or to any building system within the leased building. Therefore, under paragraphs (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) and (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, if an amount paid by K for work on the HVAC system is for an improvement to the HVAC system in the leased building, K must treat this amount as an improvement to the entire leased building property.

# Example 11. Production of real property related to leased property
Assume the same facts as in
Example 10,
except that K receives a construction allowance from L, and K uses the construction allowance to build a driveway adjacent to the leased building. Assume that under the terms of the lease, K, the lessee, is treated as the owner of any property that it constructs on or nearby the leased building. Also assume that section 110 does not apply to the construction allowance. Finally, assume that the driveway is not plant property or a network asset. Because the construction of the driveway consists of the production of real property other than a building, all the components of the driveway are functionally interdependent and are a single unit of property under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(iv) of this section.

# Example 12. Leasehold improvements; construction allowance used for lessor-owned improvements
Assume the same facts as
Example 11,
except that, under the terms of the lease, L, the lessor, is treated as the owner of any
property constructed on the leased premises. Because L, the lessor, is the owner of the driveway and the driveway is real property other than a building, all the components of the driveway are functionally interdependent and are a single unit of property under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 13. Buildings and structural components; leased office space
M provides consulting services to its clients. M conducts its consulting services business in two office spaces in the same building, each of which it leases from N under separate lease agreements. Each office space contains a separate HVAC system, which is part of the leased property. Both lease agreements provide that M is responsible for maintaining, repairing, and replacing the HVAC system that is part of the leased property. M pays amounts to perform work on the HVAC system in each office space. Because M leases two separate office spaces subject to two leases, M must treat the portion of the building structure and the structural components subject to each lease as a separate unit of property under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(A) of this section. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a leased building property, if it is for an improvement to the leased portion of the building structure or the portion of any designated building system subject to each lease. Under paragraphs (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) and (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, M must treat the HVAC system associated with each leased office space as a building system of that leased building property. Thus, M must treat the HVAC system associated with the first leased office space as a building system of the first leased office space and the HVAC system associated with the second leased office space as a building system of the second leased office space. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, if the amount paid by M for work on the HVAC system in one leased office space is for an improvement (for example, a betterment) to the HVAC system that is part of that leased space, then M must treat the amount as an improvement to that individual leased property.

# Example 14. Leased property; personal property
N is engaged in the business of transporting passengers on private jet aircraft. To conduct its business, N leases several aircraft from O. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (referencing paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section), N must treat all of the components of each leased aircraft that are functionally interdependent as a single unit of property. Thus, N must treat each leased aircraft as a single unit of property.

# Example 15. Improvement property
(i) P is a retailer of consumer products. In Year 1, P purchases a building from Q, which P intends to use as a retail sales facility. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, P must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a building if it is for an improvement to the building structure or any designated building system.
(ii) In Year 2, P pays an amount to construct an extension to the building to be used for additional warehouse space. Assume that the extension involves the addition of walls, floors, roof, and doors, but does not include the addition or extension of any building systems described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Also assume that the amount paid to build the extension is a betterment to the building structure under paragraph (j) of this section, and is therefore treated as an amount paid for an improvement to the entire building under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, P capitalizes the amount paid as an improvement to the building under paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the extension is not a unit of property separate from the building, the unit of property improved. Thus, to determine whether any future expenditure constitutes an improvement to the building under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, P must determine whether the expenditure constitutes an improvement to the building structure, including the building extension, or to any of the designated building systems.

# Example 16. Additional rules; year placed in service
R is engaged in the business of transporting freight throughout the United States. To conduct its business, R owns a fleet of truck tractors and trailers. Each tractor and trailer is comprised of various components, including tires. R purchased a truck tractor with all of its components, including tires. The tractor tires have an average useful life to R of more than one year. At the time R placed the tractor in service, it treated the tractor tires as a separate asset for depreciation purposes under section 168. R properly treated the tractor (excluding the cost of the tires) as 3-year property and the tractor tires as 5-year property under section 168(e). Because R's tractor is property other than a building, the initial units of property for the tractor are determined under the general rule in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and are comprised of all the components that are functionally interdependent. Under this rule, R must treat the tractor, including its tires, as a single unit of property because the tractor and the tires are functionally interdependent (that is, the placing in service of the tires is dependent upon the placing in service of the tractor). However, under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, R must treat the tractor and tires as separate units of property because R properly treated the tires as being within a different class of property under section 168(e).

# Example 17. Additional rules; change in subsequent year
S is engaged in the business of
leasing nonresidential real property to retailers. In Year 1, S acquired and placed in service a building for use in its retail leasing operation. In Year 5, to accommodate the needs of a new lessee, S incurred costs to improve the building structure. S capitalized the costs of the improvement under paragraph (d) of this section and depreciated the improvement in accordance with section 168(i)(6) as nonresidential real property under section 168(e). In Year 7, S determined that the structural improvement made in Year 5 qualified under section 168(e)(8) as qualified retail improvement property and, therefore, was 15-year property under section 168(e). In Year 7, S changed its method of accounting to use a 15-year recovery period for the improvement. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, in Year 7, S must treat the improvement as a unit of property separate from the building.

# Example 18. Additional rules; change in subsequent year
In Year 1, T acquired and placed in service a building and parking lot for use in its retail operations. Under § 1.263(a)-2 of the regulations, T capitalized the cost of the building and the parking lot and began depreciating the building and the parking lot as nonresidential real property under section 168(e). In Year 3, T completed a cost segregation study under which it properly determined that the parking lot qualified as 15-year property under section 168(e). In Year 3, T changed its method of accounting for the parking lot to use a 15-year recovery period and the 150-percent declining balance method of depreciation. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, beginning in Year 3, T must treat the parking lot as a unit of property separate from the building.

# Example 19. Additional rules; change in subsequent year
In Year 1, U acquired and placed in service a building for use in its manufacturing business. U capitalized the costs allocable to the building's wiring separately from the building and depreciated the wiring as 7-year property under section 168(e). U capitalized the cost of the building and all other structural components of the building and began depreciating them as nonresidential real property under section 168(e). In Year 3, U completed a cost segregation study under which it properly determined that the wiring is a structural component of the building and, therefore, should have been depreciated as nonresidential real property. In Year 3, U changed its method of accounting to treat the wiring as nonresidential real property. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, U must change the unit of property for the wiring in a manner that is consistent with the change in treatment for depreciation purposes. Therefore, U must change the unit of property for the wiring to treat it as a structural component of the building, and as part of the building unit of property, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
(f)
Improvements to leased property
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section (safe harbor for small taxpayers) and under § 1.263(a)-1(f) (de minimis safe harbor), this paragraph (f) provides the exclusive rules for determining whether amounts paid by a taxpayer are for an improvement to a leased property and must be capitalized. In the case of a leased building or a leased portion of a building, an amount is paid to improve a leased property if the amount is paid for an improvement to any of the properties specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section (for lessor improvements) or in paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section (for lessee improvements, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section). Section 1.263(a)-4 does not apply to amounts paid for improvements to leased property or to amounts paid for the acquisition or production of leasehold improvement property.
(2)
Lessee improvements
—(i)
Requirement to capitalize.
A taxpayer lessee must capitalize the related amounts, as determined under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, that it pays to improve, as defined under paragraph (d) of this section, a leased property except to the extent that section 110 applies to a construction allowance received by the lessee for the purpose of such improvement or when the improvement constitutes a substitute for rent. See § 1.61-8(c) for the treatment of lessee expenditures that constitute a substitute for rent. A taxpayer lessee must also capitalize the related amounts that a lessor pays to improve, as defined under paragraph (d) of this section, a leased property if the lessee is the owner of the improvement, except to the extent that section 110 applies to a construction allowance received by the lessee for the purpose of such improvement. An amount paid for a lessee improvement under this paragraph (f)(2)(i) is treated as an amount paid to acquire or produce a unit of real or personal property under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) of the regulations.
(ii)
Unit of property for lessee improvements.
For purposes of determining whether an amount paid by a lessee constitutes a lessee improvement to a
leased property under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the unit of property and the improvement rules are applied to the leased property in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) (leased buildings) or paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (leased property other than buildings) of this section and include previous lessee improvements. However, if a lessee improvement is comprised of an entire building erected on leased property, then the unit of property for the building and the application of the improvement rules to the building are determined under paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Lessor improvements
—(i)
Requirement to capitalize.
A taxpayer lessor must capitalize the related amounts, as determined under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, that it pays directly, or indirectly through a construction allowance to the lessee, to improve, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, a leased property when the lessor is the owner of the improvement or to the extent that section 110 applies to the construction allowance. A lessor must also capitalize the related amounts that the lessee pays to improve a leased property, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, when the lessee's improvement constitutes a substitute for rent. See § 1.61-8(c) for treatment of expenditures by lessees that constitute a substitute for rent. Amounts capitalized by the lessor under this paragraph (f)(3)(i) may not be capitalized by the lessee. If a lessor improvement is comprised of an entire building erected on leased property, then the amount paid for the building is treated as an amount paid by the lessor to acquire or produce a unit of property under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1). See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the unit of property for a building and paragraph (e)(3) of this section for the unit of property for real or personal property other than a building.
(ii)
Unit of property for lessor improvements.
In general, an amount capitalized as a lessor improvement under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section is not a unit of property separate from the unit of property improved. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section. However, if a lessor improvement is comprised of an entire building erected on leased property, then the unit of property for the building and the application of the improvement rules to the building are determined under paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f) and do not address whether capitalization is required under another provision of the Code (for example, section 263A). For purposes of the following examples, assume that section 110 does not apply to the lessee and the amounts paid by the lessee are not a substitute for rent.

# Example 1. Lessee improvements; additions to building
(i) T is a retailer of consumer products. In Year 1, T leases a building from L, which T intends to use as a retail sales facility. The leased building consists of the building structure under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and various building systems under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, including a plumbing system, an electrical system, and an HVAC system. Under the terms of the lease, T is permitted to improve the building at its own expense. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(A) of this section, because T leases the entire building, T must treat the leased building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a leased building property if the amount is paid for an improvement to the leased building structure or to any building system within the leased building. Therefore, under paragraphs (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if T pays an amount that improves the building structure, the plumbing system, the electrical system, or the HVAC system, then T must treat this amount as an improvement to the entire leased building property.
(ii) In Year 2, T pays an amount to construct an extension to the building to be used for additional warehouse space. Assume that this amount is for a betterment (as defined under paragraph (j) of this section) to T's leased building structure and does not affect any building systems. Accordingly, the amount that T pays for the building extension is for a betterment to the leased building structure, and thus, under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section, is treated as an improvement to the entire leased building under paragraph (d) of this section. Because T, the lessee, paid an amount to improve a leased building property, T is required to capitalize the amount paid for the building extension as a leasehold improvement under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. In addition, paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section requires T to treat the amount paid for the improvement as the acquisition or production
of a unit of property (leasehold improvement property) under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1).
(iii) In Year 5, T pays an amount to add a large overhead door to the building extension that it constructed in Year 2 to accommodate the loading of larger products into the warehouse space. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, to determine whether the amount paid by T is for a leasehold improvement, the unit of property and the improvement rules are applied in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section and include T's previous improvements to the leased property. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(A) of this section, the unit of property is the entire leased building, including the extension built in Year 2. In addition, under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, the leased building property is improved if the amount is paid for an improvement to the building structure or any building system. Assume that the amount paid to add the overhead door is for a betterment, under paragraph (j) of this section, to the building structure, which includes the extension. Accordingly, T must capitalize the amounts paid to add the overhead door as a leasehold improvement to the leased building property. In addition, paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section requires T to treat the amount paid for the improvement as the acquisition or production of a unit of property (leasehold improvement property) under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1). However, to determine whether a future amount paid by T is for a leasehold improvement to the leased building, the unit of property and the improvement rules are again applied in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section and include the new overhead door.

# Example 2. Lessee improvements; additions to certain structural components of buildings
(i) Assume the same facts as
Example 1
except that in Year 2, T also pays an amount to construct an extension of the HVAC system into the building extension. Assume that the extension is a betterment, under paragraph (j) of this section, to the leased HVAC system (a building system under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section). Accordingly, the amount that T pays for the extension of the HVAC system is for a betterment to the leased building system, the HVAC system, and thus, under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section, is treated as an improvement to the entire leased building property under paragraph (d) of this section. Because T, the lessee, pays an amount to improve a leased building property, T is required to capitalize the amount paid as a leasehold improvement under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, T must treat the amount paid for the HVAC extension as the acquisition and production of a unit of property (leasehold improvement property) under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1).
(ii) In Year 5, T pays an amount to add an additional chiller to the portion of the HVAC system that it constructed in Year 2 to accommodate the climate control requirements for new product offerings. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, to determine whether the amount paid by T is for a leasehold improvement, the unit of property and the improvement rules are applied in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section and include T's previous improvements to the leased building property. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, the leased building property is improved if the amount is paid for an improvement to the building structure or any building system. Assume that the amount paid to add the chiller is for a betterment, under paragraph (j) of this section, to the HVAC system, which includes the extension of the system in Year 2. Accordingly, T must capitalize the amounts paid to add the chiller as a leasehold improvement to the leased building property. In addition, paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section requires T to treat the amount paid for the chiller as the acquisition or production of a unit of property (leasehold improvement property) under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1). However, to determine whether a future amount paid by T is for a leasehold improvement to the leased building, the unit of property and the improvement rules are again applied in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section and include the new chiller.

# Example 3. Lessor Improvements; additions to building
(i) T is a retailer of consumer products. In Year 1, T leases a building from L, which T intends to use as a retail sales facility. Pursuant to the lease, L provides a construction allowance to T, which T intends to use to construct an extension to the retail sales facility for additional warehouse space. Assume that the amount paid for any improvement to the building does not exceed the construction allowance and that L is treated as the owner of any improvement to the building. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, L must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. As provided under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, an amount is paid to improve a building if it is paid for an improvement to the building structure or to any building system.
(ii) In Year 2, T uses L's construction allowance to construct an extension to the leased building to provide additional warehouse space in the building. Assume that the extension is a betterment (as defined under paragraph (j) of this section) to the building structure, and therefore, the amount paid for the extension results in an improvement to the building under paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, L, the lessor and owner of the improvement, must capitalize the amounts paid to T to
construct the extension to the retail sales facility. T is not permitted to capitalize the amounts paid for the lessor-owned improvement. Finally, under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the extension to L's building is not a unit of property separate from the building and its structural components.

# Example 4. Lessee property; personal property added to leased building
T is a retailer of consumer products. T leases a building from L, which T intends to use as a retail sales facility. Pursuant to the lease, L provides a construction allowance to T, which T uses to acquire and construct partitions for fitting rooms, counters, and shelving. Assume that each partition, counter, and shelving unit is a unit of property under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Assume that for Federal income tax purposes T is treated as the owner of the partitions, counters, and shelving. T's expenditures for the partitions, counters, and shelving are not improvements to the leased property under paragraph (d) of this section, but rather constitute amounts paid to acquire or produce separate units of personal property under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1).

# Example 5. Lessor property; buildings on leased property
L is the owner of a parcel of unimproved real property that L leases to T. Pursuant to the lease, L provides a construction allowance to T of $500,000, which T agrees to use to construct a building costing not more than $500,000 on the leased real property and to lease the building from L after it is constructed. Assume that for Federal income tax purposes, L is treated as the owner of the building that T will construct. T uses the $500,000 to construct the building as required under the lease. The building consists of the building structure and the following building systems: (1) a plumbing system; (2) an electrical system; and (3) an HVAC system. Because L provides a construction allowance to T to construct a building and L is treated as the owner of the building, L must capitalize the amounts that it pays indirectly to T to construct the building as a lessor improvement under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, the amounts paid by L for the construction allowance are treated as amounts paid by L to acquire and produce the building under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1). Further, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, L must treat the building and its structural components as a single unit of property. Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, T, the lessee, may not capitalize the amounts paid (with the construction allowance received from L) for construction of the building.

# Example 6. Lessee contribution to construction costs
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except T spends $600,000 to construct the building. T uses the $500,000 construction allowance provided by L plus $100,000 of its own funds to construct the building that L will own pursuant to the lease. Also assume that the additional $100,000 that T pays is not a substitute for rent. For the reasons discussed in
Example 5,
L must capitalize the $500,000 it paid T to construct the building under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1). In addition, because T spends its own funds to complete the building, T has a depreciable interest of $100,000 in the building and must capitalize the $100,000 it paid to construct the building as a leasehold improvement under § 1.263(a)-2(d)(1) of the regulations. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, L must treat the building as a single unit of property to the extent of its depreciable interest of $500,000. In addition, under paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and (e)(2)(i) of this section, T must also treat the building as a single unit of property to the extent of its depreciable interest of $100,000.
(g)
Special rules for determining improvement costs
—(1)
Certain costs incurred during an improvement
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer must capitalize all the direct costs of an improvement and all the indirect costs (including, for example, otherwise deductible repair costs) that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of an improvement. Indirect costs arising from activities that do not directly benefit and are not incurred by reason of an improvement are not required to be capitalized under section 263(a), regardless of whether the activities are performed at the same time as an improvement.
(ii)
Exception for individuals' residences.
A taxpayer who is an individual may capitalize amounts paid for repairs and maintenance that are made at the same time as capital improvements to units of property not used in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the production of income if the amounts are paid as part of an improvement (for example, a remodeling) of the taxpayer's residence.
(2)
Removal costs
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer disposes of a depreciable asset, including a partial disposition under Prop. Reg. § 1.168(i)-1(e)(2)(ix) (September 19, 2013), or § 1.168(i)-8(d), for Federal income tax purposes and has taken into account the adjusted basis of the asset or component of the asset in realizing gain or loss, then the costs of removing the asset or component are not required to be capitalized under this section. If a depreciable asset is included in a general asset account under section 168(i)(4), and neither the regulations under section 168(i)(4) and § 1.168(i)-1(e)(3), apply to a
disposition of such asset, or a portion of such asset under § 1.168(i)-1(e)(1)(ii), a loss is treated as being realized in the amount of zero upon the disposition of the asset solely for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(i). If a taxpayer disposes of a component of a unit of property, but the disposal of the component is not a disposition for Federal tax purposes, then the taxpayer must deduct or capitalize the costs of removing the component based on whether the removal costs directly benefit or are incurred by reason of a repair to the unit of property or an improvement to the unit of property. But see § 1.280B-1 for the rules applicable to demolition of structures.
(ii)
Examples.
Thefollowing examples illustrate the application of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and, unless otherwise stated, do not address whether capitalization is required under another provision of this section or another provision of the Code (for example, section 263A). For purposes of the following examples, assume that § 1.168(i)-1(e) or § 1.168(i)-8, applies and that § 1.280B-1 does not apply.

# Example 1. Component removed during improvement; no disposition
X owns a factory building with a storage area on the second floor. X pays an amount to remove the original columns and girders supporting the second floor and replace them with new columns and girders to permit storage of supplies with a gross weight 50 percent greater than the previous load-carrying capacity of the storage area. Assume that the replacement of the columns and girders constitutes a betterment to the building structure and is therefore an improvement to the building unit of property under paragraphs (d)(1) and (j) of this section. Assume that X disposes of the original columns and girders and the disposal of these structural components is not a disposition under § 1.168(i)-1(e) or § 1.168(i)-8. Under paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (j) of this section, the amount paid to remove the columns and girders must be capitalized as a cost of the improvement, because it directly benefits and is incurred by reason of the improvement to the building.

# Example 2. Component removed during improvement; disposition
Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except X disposes of the original columns and girders and elects to treat the disposal of these structural components as a partial disposition of the factory building under § 1.168(i)-8(d), taking into account the adjusted basis of the components in realizing loss on the disposition. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the amount paid to remove the columns and girders is not required to be capitalized as part of the cost of the improvement regardless of their relation to the improvement. However, all the remaining costs of replacing the columns and girders must be capitalized as improvements to the building unit of property under paragraphs (d)(1), (j), and (g)(1) of this section.

# Example 3. Component removed during repair or maintenance; no disposition
Y owns a building in which it conducts its retail business. The roof over Y's building is covered with shingles. Over time, the shingles begin to wear and Y begins to experience leaks into its retail premises. However, the building still functions in Y's business. To eliminate the problems, a contractor recommends that Y remove the original shingles and replace them with new shingles. Accordingly, Y pays the contractor to replace the old shingles with new but comparable shingles. The new shingles are comparable to original shingles but correct the leakage problems. Assume that replacement of old shingles with new shingles to correct the leakage is not a betterment or a restoration of the building structure or systems under paragraph (j) or (k) of this section and does not adapt the building structure or systems to a new or different use under paragraph (l) of this section. Thus, the amounts paid by Y to replace the shingles are not improvements to the building unit of property under paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the amounts paid to remove the shingles are not required to be capitalized because they directly benefit and are incurred by reason of repair or maintenance to the building structure.

# Example 4. Component removed with disposition and restoration
Assume the same facts as
Example 3
except Y disposes of the original shingles, and Y elects to treat the disposal of these components as a partial disposition of the building under § 1.168(i)-8(d), and deducts the adjusted basis of the components as a loss on the disposition. Under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section, amounts paid for replacement of the shingles constitute a restoration of the building structure because the amounts are paid for the replacement of a component of the structure and the taxpayer has properly deducted a loss for that component. Thus, under paragraphs (d)(2) and (k) of this section, Y is required to capitalize the amounts paid for the replacement of the shingles as an improvement to the building unit of property. However, under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the amounts paid by Y to remove the original shingles are not required to be capitalized as part of the costs of the improvement, regardless of their relation to the improvement.
(3)
Related amounts.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, amounts paid to improve a unit of property include amounts paid over a period of more than one taxable year. Whether amounts are related to the same improvement depends on the facts and circumstances of the activities being performed.
(4)
Compliance with regulatory requirements.
For purposes of this section, a Federal, state, or local regulator's requirement that a taxpayer perform certain repairs or maintenance on a unit of property to continue operating the property is not relevant in determining whether the amount paid improves the unit of property.
(h)
Safe harbor for small taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
A qualifying taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) may elect to not apply paragraph (d) or paragraph (f) of this section to an eligible building property (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) if the total amount paid during the taxable year for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on the eligible building property does not exceed the lesser of—
(i) 2 percent of the unadjusted basis (as defined under paragraph (h)(5) of this section) of the eligible building property; or
(ii) $10,000.
(2)
Application with other safe harbor provisions.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on eligible building property include those amounts not capitalized under the de minimis safe harbor election under § 1.263(a)-1(f) and those amounts deemed not to improve property under the safe harbor for routine maintenance under paragraph (i) of this section.
(3)
Qualifying taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (h), the term
qualifying taxpayer
means a taxpayer whose average annual gross receipts as determined under this paragraph (h)(3) for the three preceding taxable years is less than or equal to $10,000,000.
(ii)
Application to new taxpayers.
If a taxpayer has been in existence for less than three taxable years, the taxpayer determines its average annual gross receipts for the number of taxable years (including short taxable years) that the taxpayer (or its predecessor) has been in existence.
(iii)
Treatment of short taxable year.
In the case of any taxable year of less than 12 months (a short taxable year), the gross receipts shall be annualized by—
(A) Multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12; and
(B) Dividing the product determined in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section by the number of months in the short period.
(iv)
Definition of gross receipts.
For purposes of applying paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the term
gross receipts
means the taxpayer's receipts for the taxable year that are properly recognized under the taxpayer's methods of accounting used for Federal income tax purposes for the taxable year. For this purpose, gross receipts include total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (including original issue discount and tax-exempt interest within the meaning of section 103), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether such amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade of business. Gross receipts are not reduced by cost of goods sold or by the cost of property sold if such property is described in section 1221(a)(1), (3), (4), or (5). With respect to sales of capital assets as defined in section 1221, or sales of property described in section 1221(a)(2) (relating to property used in a trade or business), gross receipts shall be reduced by the taxpayer's adjusted basis in such property. Gross receipts do not include the repayment of a loan or similar instrument (for example, a repayment of the principal amount of a loan held by a commercial lender) and, except to the extent of gain recognized, do not include gross receipts derived from a non-recognition transaction, such as a section 1031 exchange. Finally, gross receipts do not include amounts received by the taxpayer with respect to sales tax or other similar state and local taxes if, under
the applicable state or local law, the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the tax to the taxing authority. If, in contrast, the tax is imposed on the taxpayer under the applicable law, then gross receipts include the amounts received that are allocable to the payment of such tax.
(4)
Eligible building property.
For purposes of this section, the term
eligible building property
refers to each unit of property defined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (building), paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) (condominium), paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(A) (cooperative), or paragraph (e)(2)(v)(A) (leased building or portion of building) of this section, as applicable, that has an unadjusted basis of $1,000,000 or less.
(5)
Unadjusted basis
—(i)
Eligible building property owned by taxpayer.
For purposes of this section, the unadjusted basis of eligible building property owned by the taxpayer means the basis as determined under section 1012, or other applicable sections of Chapter 1, including subchapters O (relating to gain or loss on dispositions of property), C (relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), K (relating to partners and partnerships), and P (relating to capital gains and losses). Unadjusted basis is determined without regard to any adjustments described in section 1016(a)(2) or (3) or to amounts for which the taxpayer has elected to treat as an expense (for example, under sections 179, 179B, or 179C).
(ii)
Eligible building property leased to the taxpayer.
For purposes of this section, the unadjusted basis of eligible building property leased to the taxpayer is the total amount of (undiscounted) rent paid or expected to be paid by the lessee under the lease for the entire term of the lease, including renewal periods if all the facts and circumstances in existence during the taxable year in which the lease is entered indicate a reasonable expectancy of renewal. Section 1.263(a)-4(f)(5)(ii) provides the factors that are significant in determining whether there exists a reasonable expectancy of renewal for purposes of this paragraph.
(6)
Time and manner of election.
A taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section by attaching a statement to the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which amounts are paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on the eligible building property providing that such amounts qualify under the safe harbor provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Sections 301.9100-1 through 301.9100-3 of this chapter provide the rules governing extensions of the time to make regulatory elections. The statement must be titled, “Section 1.263(a)-3(h) Safe Harbor Election for Small Taxpayers” and include the taxpayer's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and a description of each eligible building property to which the taxpayer is applying the election. In the case of an S corporation or a partnership, the election is made by the S corporation or by the partnership, and not by the shareholders or partners. An election may not be made through the filing of an application for change in accounting method or, before obtaining the Commissioner's consent to make a late election, by filing an amended Federal tax return. A taxpayer may not revoke an election made under this paragraph (h). The time and manner of making the election under this paragraph (h) may be modified through guidance of general applicability (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(7)
Treatment of safe harbor amounts.
Amounts paid by the taxpayer for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities to which the taxpayer properly applies the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(1) of this section and for which the taxpayer properly makes the election under paragraph (h)(6) of this section are not treated as improvements under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section and may be deducted under § 1.162-1 or § 1.212-1, as applicable, in the taxable year these amounts are paid, provided the amounts otherwise qualify for a deduction under these sections.
(8)
Safe harbor exceeded.
If total amounts paid by a qualifying taxpayer during the taxable year for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on an eligible
building property exceed the safe harbor limitations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, then the safe harbor election is not available for that eligible building property and the taxpayer must apply the general improvement rules under this section to determine whether amounts are for improvements to the unit of property, including the safe harbor for routine maintenance under paragraph (i) of this section. The taxpayer may also elect to apply the de minimis safe harbor under § 1.263(a)-1(f) to amounts qualifying under that safe harbor irrespective of the application of this paragraph (h).

Modification of safe harbor amounts.
The amount limitations provided in paragraphs (h)(1)(i), (h)(1)(ii), and (h)(3) of this section may be modified through published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(10)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (h). Assume that § 1.212-1 does not apply to the amounts paid.

# Example 1. Safe harbor for small taxpayers applicable
A is a qualifying taxpayer under paragraph (h)(3) of this section. A owns an office building in which A provides consulting services. In Year 1, A's building has an unadjusted basis of $750,000 as determined under paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section. In Year 1, A pays $5,500 for repairs, maintenance, improvements and similar activities to the office building. Because A's building unit of property has an unadjusted basis of $1,000,000 or less, A's building constitutes eligible building property under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. The aggregate amount paid by A during Year 1 for repairs, maintenance, improvements and similar activities on this eligible building property does not exceed the lesser of $15,000 (2 percent of the building's unadjusted basis of $750,000) or $10,000. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, A may elect to not apply the capitalization rule of paragraph (d) of this section to the amounts paid for repair, maintenance, improvements, or similar activities on the office building in Year 1. If A properly makes the election under paragraph (h)(6) of this section for the office building and the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business, A may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1 in Year 1.

# Example 2. Safe harbor for small taxpayers inapplicable
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A pays $10,500 for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on its office building in Year 1. Because this amount exceeds $10,000, the lesser of the two limitations provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, A may not apply the safe harbor for small taxpayers under paragraph (h)(1) of this section to the total amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on the building. Therefore, A must apply the general improvement rules under this section to determine which of the aggregate amounts paid are for improvements and must be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section and which of the amounts are for repair and maintenance under § 1.162-4.

# Example 3. Safe harbor applied building-by-building
(i) B is a qualifying taxpayer under paragraph (h)(3) of this section. B owns two rental properties, Building M and Building N. Building M and Building N are both multi-family residential buildings. In Year 1, each property has an unadjusted basis of $300,000 under paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Because Building M and Building N each have an unadjusted basis of $1,000,000 or less, Building M and Building N each constitute eligible building property in Year 1 under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. In Year 1, B pays $5,000 for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on Building M. In Year 1, B also pays $7,000 for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on Building N.
(ii) The total amount paid by B during Year 1 for repairs, maintenance, improvements and similar activities on Building M ($5,000) does not exceed the lesser of $6,000 (2 percent of the building's unadjusted basis of $300,000) or $10,000. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for Year 1, B may elect to not apply the capitalization rule under paragraph (d) of this section to the amounts it paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities on Building M. If B properly makes the election under paragraph (h)(6) of this section for Building M and the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on B's trade or business, B may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1.
(iii) The total amount paid by B during Year 1 for repairs, maintenance, improvements and similar activities on Building N ($7,000) exceeds $6,000 (2 percent of the building's unadjusted basis of $300,000), the lesser of the two limitations provided under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Therefore, B may not apply the safe harbor under paragraph (h)(1) of this section to the total amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on Building N. Instead, B must apply the general improvement rules under this section to
determine which of the total amounts paid for work performed on Building N are for improvements and must be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section and which amounts are for repair and maintenance under § 1.162-4.

# Example 4. Safe harbor applied to leased building property
C is a qualifying taxpayer under paragraph (h)(3) of this section. C is the lessee of a building in which C operates a retail store. The lease is a triple-net lease, and the lease term is 20 years, including reasonably expected renewals. C pays $4,000 per month in rent. In Year 1, C pays $7,000 for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities performed on the building. Under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, the unadjusted basis of C's leased unit of property is $960,000 ($4,000 monthly rent × 12 months × 20 years). Because C's leased building has an unadjusted basis of $1,000,000 or less, the building is eligible building property for Year 1 under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. The total amount paid by C during Year 1 for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities on the leased building ($7,000) does not exceed the lesser of $19,200 (2 percent of the building's unadjusted basis of $960,000) or $10,000. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for Year 1, C may elect to not apply the capitalization rule under paragraph (d) of this section to the amounts it paid for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar activities on the leased building. If C properly makes the election under paragraph (h)(6) of this section for the leased building and the amounts otherwise constitute deductible ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on C's trade or business, C may deduct these amounts under § 1.162-1.
(i)
Safe harbor for routine maintenance on property
—(1)
In general.
An amount paid for routine maintenance (as defined in paragraph (i)(1)(i) or (i)(1)(ii) of this section, as applicable) on a unit of tangible property, or in the case of a building, on any of the properties designated in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii)(B), (e)(2)(iv)(B), or paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, is deemed not to improve that unit of property.
(i)
Routine maintenance for buildings.
Routine maintenance for a building unit of property is the recurring activities that a taxpayer expects to perform as a result of the taxpayer's use of any of the properties designated in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii)(B), (e)(2)(iv)(B), or (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section to keep the building structure or each building system in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. Routine maintenance activities include, for example, the inspection, cleaning, and testing of the building structure or each building system, and the replacement of damaged or worn parts with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Routine maintenance may be performed any time during the useful life of the building structure or building systems. However, the activities are routine only if the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform the activities more than once during the 10-year period beginning at the time the building structure or the building system upon which the routine maintenance is performed is placed in service by the taxpayer. A taxpayer's expectation will not be deemed unreasonable merely because the taxpayer does not actually perform the maintenance a second time during the 10-year period, provided that the taxpayer can otherwise substantiate that its expectation was reasonable at the time the property was placed in service. Factors to be considered in determining whether maintenance is routine and whether a taxpayer's expectation is reasonable include the recurring nature of the activity, industry practice, manufacturers' recommendations, and the taxpayer's experience with similar or identical property. With respect to a taxpayer that is a lessor of a building or a part of the building, the taxpayer's use of the building unit of property includes the lessee's use of its unit of property.
(ii)
Routine maintenance for property other than buildings.
Routine maintenance for property other than buildings is the recurring activities that a taxpayer expects to perform as a result of the taxpayer's use of the unit of property to keep the unit of property in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. Routine maintenance activities include, for example, the inspection, cleaning, and testing of the unit of property, and the replacement of damaged or worn parts of the unit of property with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Routine maintenance may be performed any time during the useful life of the unit of property. However, the activities are routine only if, at the time the unit of property is placed in
service by the taxpayer, the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform the activities more than once during the class life (as defined in paragraph (i)(4) of this section) of the unit of property. A taxpayer's expectation will not be deemed unreasonable merely because the taxpayer does not actually perform the maintenance a second time during the class life of the unit of property, provided that the taxpayer can otherwise substantiate that its expectation was reasonable at the time the property was placed in service. Factors to be considered in determining whether maintenance is routine and whether the taxpayer's expectation is reasonable include the recurring nature of the activity, industry practice, manufacturers' recommendations, and the taxpayer's experience with similar or identical property. With respect to a taxpayer that is a lessor of a unit of property, the taxpayer's use of the unit of property includes the lessee's use of the unit of property.
(2)
Rotable and temporary spare parts.
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, amounts paid for routine maintenance include routine maintenance performed on (and with regard to) rotable and temporary spare parts.
(3)
Exceptions.
Routine maintenance does not include the following:
(i) Amounts paid for a betterment to a unit of property under paragraph (j) of this section;
(ii) Amounts paid for the replacement of a component of a unit of property for which the taxpayer has properly deducted a loss for that component (other than a casualty loss under § 1.165-7) (see paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section);
(iii) Amounts paid for the replacement of a component of a unit of property for which the taxpayer has properly taken into account the adjusted basis of the component in realizing gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of the component (see paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section);
(iv) Amounts paid for the restoration of damage to a unit of property for which the taxpayer is required to take a basis adjustment as a result of a casualty loss under section 165, or relating to a casualty event described in section 165, subject to the limitation in paragraph (k)(4) of this section (see paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section);
(v) Amounts paid to return a unit of property to its ordinarily efficient operating condition, if the property has deteriorated to a state of disrepair and is no longer functional for its intended use (see paragraph (k)(1)(iv) of this section);
(vi) Amounts paid to adapt a unit of property to a new or different use under paragraph (l) of this section;
(vii) Amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, or improvement of network assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section); or
(viii) Amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, or improvement of rotable and temporary spare parts to which the taxpayer applies the optional method of accounting for rotable and temporary spare parts under § 1.162-3(e).
(4)
Class life.
The class life of a unit of property is the recovery period prescribed for the property under sections 168(g)(2) and (3) for purposes of the alternative depreciation system, regardless of whether the property is depreciated under section 168(g). For purposes of determining class life under this section, section 168(g)(3)(A) (relating to tax-exempt use property subject to lease) does not apply. If the unit of property is comprised of components with different class lives, then the class life of the unit of property is deemed to be the same as the component with the longest class life.
(5)
Coordination with section 263A.
Amounts paid for routine maintenance under this paragraph (i) may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if these amounts comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of other property produced by the taxpayer or property acquired for resale. See, for example, § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(O) requiring taxpayers to capitalize the cost of repairing equipment or facilities allocable to property produced or property acquired for resale.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (i) and, unless otherwise stated, do not address the treatment under other provisions of the Code (for example, section 263A). In addition, unless
otherwise stated, assume that the taxpayer has not applied the optional method of accounting for rotable and temporary spare parts under § 1.162-3(e).

# Example 1. Routine maintenance on component
(i) A is a commercial airline engaged in the business of transporting passengers and freight throughout the United States and abroad. To conduct its business, A owns or leases various types of aircraft. As a condition of maintaining its airworthiness certification for these aircraft, A is required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish and adhere to a continuous maintenance program for each aircraft within its fleet. These programs, which are designed by A and the aircraft's manufacturer and approved by the FAA, are incorporated into each aircraft's maintenance manual. The maintenance manuals require a variety of periodic maintenance visits at various intervals. One type of maintenance visit is an engine shop visit (ESV), which A expects to perform on its aircraft engines approximately every 4 years to keep its aircraft in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. In Year 1, A purchased a new aircraft, which included four new engines attached to the airframe. The four aircraft engines acquired with the aircraft are not materials or supplies under § 1.162-3(c)(1)(i) because they are acquired as part of a single unit of property, the aircraft. In Year 5, A performs its first ESV on the aircraft engines. The ESV includes disassembly, cleaning, inspection, repair, replacement, reassembly, and testing of the engine and its component parts. During the ESV, the engine is removed from the aircraft and shipped to an outside vendor who performs the ESV. If inspection or testing discloses a discrepancy in a part's conformity to the specifications in A's maintenance program, the part is repaired, or if necessary, replaced with a comparable and commercially available replacement part. After the ESVs, the engines are returned to A to be reinstalled on another aircraft or stored for later installation. Assume that the class life for A's aircraft, including the engines, is 12 years. Assume that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the costs of performing the ESVs.
(ii) Because the ESVs involve the recurring activities that A expects to perform as a result of its use of the aircraft to keep the aircraft in ordinarily efficient operating condition and consist of maintenance activities that A expects to perform more than once during the 12 year class life of the aircraft, A's ESVs are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the ESVs are deemed not to improve the aircraft and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 2. Routine maintenance after class life
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that in year 15 A pays amounts to perform an ESV on one of the original aircraft engines after the end of the class life of the aircraft. Because this ESV involves the same routine maintenance activities that were performed on aircraft engines in
Example 1,
this ESV also is within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for this ESV, even though performed after the class life of the aircraft, are deemed not to improve the aircraft and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 3. Routine maintenance on rotable spare parts
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that in addition to the four engines purchased as part of the aircraft, A separately purchases four additional new engines that A intends to use in its aircraft fleet to avoid operational downtime when ESVs are required to be performed on the engines previously installed on an aircraft. Later in Year 1, A installs these four engines on an aircraft in its fleet. In Year 5, A performs the first ESVs on these four engines. Assume that these ESVs involve the same routine maintenance activities that were performed on the engines in
Example 1,
and that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to these ESVs. After the ESVs were performed, these engines were reinstalled on other aircraft or stored for later installation.
(ii) The additional aircraft engines are rotable spare parts under § 1.162-3(c)(2) because they were acquired separately from the aircraft, are removable from the aircraft, and are repaired and reinstalled on other aircraft or stored for later installation. Assume the class life of an engine is the same as the airframe, 12 years. Because the ESVs involve the recurring activities that A expects to perform as a result of its use of the engines to keep the engines in ordinarily efficient operating condition, and consist of maintenance activities that A expects to perform more than once during the 12 year class life of the engine, the ESVs fall within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the ESVs for the four additional engines are deemed not to improve these engines and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section. For the treatment of amounts paid to acquire the engines, see § 1.162-3(a).

# Example 4. Routine maintenance resulting from prior owner's use
(i) In January, Year 1, B purchases a used machine for use in its manufacturing operations. Assume that the machine is the unit of property and has a class life of 10 years. B places the machine in
service in January, Year 1, and at that time, B expects to perform manufacturer recommended scheduled maintenance on the machine approximately every three years. The scheduled maintenance includes the cleaning and oiling of the machine, the inspection of parts for defects, and the replacement of minor items such as springs, bearings, and seals with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. At the time B purchased the machine, the machine was approaching the end of a three-year scheduled maintenance period. As a result, in February, Year 1, B pays amounts to perform the manufacturer recommended scheduled maintenance. Assume that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance.
(ii) The majority of B's costs do not qualify under the routine maintenance safe harbor in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section because the costs were incurred primarily as a result of the prior owner's use of the property and not B's use. B acquired the machine just before it had received its three-year scheduled maintenance. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance resulted from the prior owner's, and not B's, use of the property and must be capitalized if those amounts result in a betterment under paragraph (i) of this section, including the amelioration of a material condition or defect, or otherwise result in an improvement under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 5. Routine maintenance resulting from new owner's use
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4,
except that after B pays amounts for the maintenance in Year 1, B continues to operate the machine in its manufacturing business. In Year 4, B pays amounts to perform the next scheduled manufacturer recommended maintenance on the machine. Assume that the scheduled maintenance activities performed are the same as those performed in
Example 4
and that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance. Because the scheduled maintenance performed in Year 4 involves the recurring activities that B performs as a result of its use of the machine, keeps the machine in an ordinarily efficient operating condition, and consists of maintenance activities that B expects to perform more than once during the 10-year class life of the machine, B's scheduled maintenance costs are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance in Year 4 are deemed not to improve the machine and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 6. Routine maintenance; replacement of substantial structural part; coordination with section 263A
C is in the business of producing commercial products for sale. As part of the production process, C places raw materials into lined containers in which a chemical reaction is used to convert raw materials into the finished product. The lining, which comprises 60 percent of the total physical structure of the container, is a substantial structural part of the container. Assume that each container, including its lining, is the unit of property and that a container has a class life of 12 years. At the time that C placed the container into service, C was aware that approximately every three years, the container lining would need to be replaced with comparable and commercially available replacement materials. At the end of three years, the container will continue to function, but will become less efficient and the replacement of the lining will be necessary to keep the container in an ordinarily efficient operating condition. In Year 1, C acquired 10 new containers and placed them into service. In Year 4, Year 7, Year 9, and Year 12, C pays amounts to replace the containers' linings with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Assume that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the amounts paid for the replacement linings. Because the replacement of the linings involves recurring activities that C expects to perform as a result of its use of the containers to keep the containers in their ordinarily efficient operating condition and consists of maintenance activities that C expects to perform more than once during the 12-year class life of the containers, C's lining replacement costs are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts that C paid for the replacement of the container linings are deemed not to improve the containers and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section. However, the amounts paid to replace the lining may be subject to capitalization under section 263A if the amounts paid for this maintenance comprise the direct or allocable indirect costs of the property produced by C. See § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(O).

# Example 7. Routine maintenance once during class life
D is a Class I railroad that owns a fleet of freight cars. Assume that a freight car, including all its components, is a unit of property and has a class life of 14 years. At the time that D places a freight car into service, D expects to perform cyclical reconditioning to the car every 8 to 10 years to keep the freight car in ordinarily efficient operating condition. During this reconditioning, D pays amounts to disassemble, inspect, and recondition or replace components of the freight car with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Ten years after D places the freight car in service, D pays amounts to perform a cyclical reconditioning on the car. Because D expects
to perform the reconditioning only once during the 14 year class life of the freight car, the amounts D pays for the reconditioning do not qualify for the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, D must capitalize the amounts paid for the reconditioning of the freight car if these amounts result in an improvement under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 8. Routine maintenance; reasonable expectation
Assume the same facts as
Example 7,
except in Year 1, D acquires and places in service several refrigerated freight cars, which also have a class life of 14 years. Because of the special requirements of these cars, at the time they are placed in service, D expects to perform a reconditioning of the refrigeration components of the freight car every 6 years to keep the freight car in an ordinarily efficient operating condition. During the reconditioning, D pays amounts to disassemble, inspect, and recondition or replace the refrigeration components of the freight car with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Assume that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the amounts paid for the reconditioning of these freight cars. In Year 6, D pays amounts to perform a reconditioning on the refrigeration components on one of the freight cars. However, because of changes in the frequency that D utilizes this freight car, D does not perform the second reconditioning on the same freight car until Year 15, after the end of the 14-year class life of the car. Under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, D's reasonable expectation that it would perform the reconditioning every 6 years will not be deemed unreasonable merely because D did not actually perform the reconditioning a second time during the 14-year class life, provided that D can substantiate that its expectation was reasonable at the time the property was placed in service. If D can demonstrate that its expectation was reasonable in Year 1 using the factors provided in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, then the amounts paid by D to recondition the refrigerated freight car components in Year 6 and in Year 15 are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section.

# Example 9. Routine maintenance on non-rotable part
E is a towboat operator that owns and leases a fleet of towboats. Each towboat is equipped with two diesel-powered engines. Assume that each towboat, including its engines, is the unit of property and that a towboat has a class life of 18 years. At the time that E places its towboats into service, E is aware that approximately every three to four years E will need to perform scheduled maintenance on the two towboat engines to keep the engines in their ordinarily efficient operating condition. This maintenance is completed while the engines are attached to the towboat and involves the cleaning and inspecting of the engines to determine which parts are within acceptable operating tolerances and can continue to be used, which parts must be reconditioned to be brought back to acceptable tolerances, and which parts must be replaced. Engine parts replaced during these procedures are replaced with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Assume the towboat engines are not rotable spare parts under § 1.162-3(c)(2). In Year 1, E acquired a new towboat, including its two engines, and placed the towboat into service. In Year 5, E pays amounts to perform scheduled maintenance on both engines in the towboat. Assume that none of the exceptions set out in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the scheduled maintenance costs. Because the scheduled maintenance involves recurring activities that E expects to perform more than once during the 18-year class life of the towboat, the maintenance results from E's use of the towboat, and the maintenance is performed to keep the towboat in an ordinarily efficient operating condition, the scheduled maintenance on E's towboat is within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance to its towboat engines in Year 5 are deemed not to improve the towboat and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 10. Routine maintenance with related betterments
Assume the same facts as
Example 9,
except that in Year 9 E's towboat engines are due for another scheduled maintenance visit. At this time, E decides to upgrade the engines to increase their horsepower and propulsion, which would permit the towboats to tow heavier loads. Accordingly, in Year 9, E pays amounts to perform many of the same activities that it would perform during the typical scheduled maintenance activities such as cleaning, inspecting, reconditioning, and replacing minor parts, but at the same time, E incurs costs to upgrade certain engine parts to increase the towing capacity of the boats in excess of the capacity of the boats when E placed them in service. In combination with the replacement of parts with new and upgraded parts, the scheduled maintenance must be completed to perform the horsepower and propulsion upgrade. Thus, the work done on the engines encompasses more than the recurring activities that E expected to perform as a result of its use of the towboats and did more than keep the towboat in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. Rather under paragraph (j) of this section, the amounts paid to increase the horsepower and propulsion of the engines are for a betterment to the towboat, and such amounts are excepted from the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph
(i)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the scheduled maintenance procedures directly benefit the upgrades. Therefore, the amounts that E paid in Year 9 for the maintenance and upgrade of the engines do not qualify for the routine maintenance safe harbor described under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section. Rather, E must capitalize the amounts paid for maintenance and upgrades of the engines as an improvement to the towboats under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 11. Routine maintenance with unrelated improvements
Assume the same facts as
Example 9,
except in Year 5, in addition to paying amounts to perform the scheduled engine maintenance on both engines, E also incurs costs to upgrade the communications and navigation systems in the pilot house of the towboat with new state-of-the-art systems. Assume the amounts paid to upgrade the communications and navigation systems are for betterments under paragraph (j) of this section, and therefore result in an improvement to the towboat under paragraph (d) of this section. In contrast with
Example 9,
the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance on E's towboat engines are not otherwise related to the upgrades to the navigation systems. Because the scheduled maintenance on the towboat engines does not directly benefit and is not incurred by reason of the upgrades to the communication and navigation systems, the amounts paid for the scheduled engine maintenance are not a direct or indirect cost of the improvement under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the scheduled maintenance to its towboat engines in Year 5 are routine maintenance deemed not to improve the towboat and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 12. Exceptions to routine maintenance
F owns and operates a farming and cattle ranch with an irrigation system that provides water for crops. Assume that each canal in the irrigation system is a single unit of property and has a class life of 20 years. At the time F placed the canals into service, F expected to have to perform major maintenance on the canals every three years to keep the canals in their ordinarily efficient operating condition. This maintenance includes draining the canals, and then cleaning, inspecting, repairing, and reconditioning or replacing parts of the canal with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. F placed the canals into service in Year 1 and did not perform any maintenance on the canals until Year 6. At that time, the canals had fallen into a state of disrepair and no longer functioned for irrigation. In Year 6, F pays amounts to drain the canals and do extensive cleaning, repairing, reconditioning, and replacing parts of the canals with comparable and commercially available replacement parts. Although the work performed on F's canals was similar to the activities that F expected to perform, but did not perform, every three years, the costs of these activities do not fall within the routine maintenance safe harbor. Specifically, under paragraph (i)(3)(v) of this section, routine maintenance does not include activities that return a unit of property to its former ordinarily efficient operating condition if the property has deteriorated to a state of disrepair and is no longer functional for its intended use. Accordingly, amounts that F pays for work performed on the canals in Year 6 must be capitalized if they result in improvements under paragraph (d) of this section (for example, restorations under paragraph (k) of this section).

# Example 13. Routine maintenance on a building; escalator system
In Year 1, G acquires a large retail mall in which it leases space to retailers. The mall contains an escalator system with 40 escalators, which includes landing platforms, trusses, tracks, steps, handrails, and safety brushes. In Year 1, when G placed its building into service, G reasonably expected that it would need to replace the handrails on the escalators approximately every four years to keep the escalator system in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. After a routine inspection and test of the escalator system in Year 4, G determines that the handrails need to be replaced and pays an amount to replace the handrails with comparable and commercially available handrails. The escalator system, including the handrails, is a building system under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section. Assume that none of the exceptions in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the scheduled maintenance costs. Because the replacement of the handrails involves recurring activities that G expects to perform as a result of its use of the escalator system to keep the escalator system in an ordinarily efficient operating condition, and G reasonably expects to perform these activities more than once during the 10-year period beginning at the time building system was placed in service, the amounts paid by G for the handrail replacements are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the amounts paid for the replacement of the handrails in Year 4 are deemed not to improve the building unit of property and are not required to be capitalized under paragraph (d) of this section.

# Example 14. Not routine maintenance; escalator system
Assume the same facts as in
Example 13,
except that in Year 9, G pays amounts to replace the steps of the escalators. In Year 1, when G placed its building into service, G reasonably expected that approximately every 18 to 20 years G would
need to replace the steps to keep the escalator system in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. Because the replacement does not involve recurring activities that G expects to perform more than once during the 10-year period beginning at the time the building structure or the building system was placed in service, the costs of these activities do not fall within the routine maintenance safe harbor. Accordingly, amounts that G pays to replace the steps in Year 9 must be capitalized if they result in improvements under paragraph (d) of this section (for example, restorations under paragraph (k) of this section).

# Example 15. Routine maintenance on building; reasonable expectation
In Year 1, H acquires a new office building, which it uses to provide services. The building contains an HVAC system, which is a building system under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. In Year 1, when H placed its building into service, H reasonably expected that every four years H would need to pay an outside contractor to perform detailed testing, monitoring, and preventative maintenance on its HVAC system to keep the HVAC system in its ordinarily efficient operating condition. This scheduled maintenance includes disassembly, cleaning, inspection, repair, replacement, reassembly, and testing of the HVAC system and many of its component parts. If inspection or testing discloses a problem with any component, the part is repaired, or if necessary, replaced with a comparable and commercially available replacement part. The scheduled maintenance at these intervals is recommended by the manufacturer of the HVAC system and is routinely performed on similar systems in similar buildings. Assume that none of the exceptions in paragraph (i)(3) of this section apply to the amounts paid for the maintenance on the HVAC system. In Year 4, H pays amounts to a contractor to perform the scheduled maintenance. However, H does not perform this scheduled maintenance on its building again until Year 11. Under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, H's reasonable expectation that it would perform the maintenance every 4 years will not be deemed unreasonable merely because H did not actually perform the maintenance a second time during the 10-year period, provided that H can substantiate that its expectation was reasonable at the time the property was placed in service. If H can demonstrate that its expectation was reasonable in Year 1 using the other factors considered in paragraph (i)(1)(i), then the amounts H paid for the maintenance of the HVAC system in Year 4 and in Year 11 are within the routine maintenance safe harbor under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section.

Capitalization of betterments
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer must capitalize as an improvement an amount paid for a betterment to a unit of property. An amount is paid for a betterment to a unit of property only if it—
(i) Ameliorates a material condition or defect that either existed prior to the taxpayer's acquisition of the unit of property or arose during the production of the unit of property, whether or not the taxpayer was aware of the condition or defect at the time of acquisition or production;
(ii) Is for a material addition, including a physical enlargement, expansion, extension, or addition of a major component (as defined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section) to the unit of property or a material increase in the capacity, including additional cubic or linear space, of the unit of property; or
(iii) Is reasonably expected to materially increase the productivity, efficiency, strength, quality, or output of the unit of property.
