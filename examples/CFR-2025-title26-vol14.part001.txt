If an application for a withholding certificate with respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is submitted to the Internal Revenue Service by the Transferor on the day of or any time prior to the transfer, such transferor must provide notice to the transferee prior to the transfer. No particular form is required but the notice must set forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the transferor, a brief description of the property which is the subject of the application, and the date the application was submitted to the Service. The transferee must withhold 15 percent (10 percent in the case of dispositions described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) of the amount realized as required in paragraph (b) of this section but need not report or pay over to the Service such amount (or a lesser amount as determined by the Service) until the 20th day following the Service's final determination with respect to the application. The Service will send a copy of the withholding certificate or copy of the notification denying the request for a withholding certificate to the transferee. For this purpose, the Service's final determination will be deemed to occur on the day
when the copy of the withholding certificate or the copy of the notification denying the request for a withholding certificate is mailed by the Service to the transferee (or transferees). An application is submitted to the Service on the day it is actually received by the Service at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the rules of § 7502, on the day it is mailed to the Service at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10).
(ii)
Anti-abuse rule
—(A)
In general.
A transferee that in reliance upon the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) fails to report and pay over amounts withheld by the 20th day following the date of the transfer, shall be subject to the payment of interest and penalties if the relevant application for a withholding certificate (or an amendment to the application for a withholding certificate) was submitted for a principal purpose of delaying the transferee's payment to the IRS of the amount withheld. Interest and penalties shall be assessed on the amount that is ultimately paid over (or collected pursuant to the agreement) with respect to the period between the 20th day after the date of the transfer and the date on which payment is made (or collected).
(B)
Presumption.
A principal purpose of delaying payment of the amount withheld shall be presumed if—
(
1
) The transferee applies for a withholding certificate pursuant to § 1.1445-3(c) based on a determination of the transferor's maximum tax liability, and
(
2
) Such liability is ultimately determined to be equal to 90 percent or more of the amount that was otherwise required to be withheld and paid over. However, the presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by evidence establishing that delaying payment of the amount withheld was not a principal purpose of the transaction.

(e)
Liability of transferee upon failure to withhold
—(1)
In general.
Every person required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 is made liable for that tax by section 1461. Therefore, a person that is required to deduct and withhold tax but fails to do so may be held liable for the payment of the tax and any applicable penalties and interest.
(2)
Transferor's liability not otherwise satisfied
—(i)
Tax and penalties.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, if a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then the tax shall be assessed against and collected from that transferee. Such person may also be subject to any of the civil and criminal penalties that apply. Corporate officers or other responsible persons may be subject to a civil penalty under section 6672 equal to the amount that should have been withheld and paid over.
(ii)
Interest.
If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such transferee shall be liable for the payment of interest pursuant to section 6601 and the regulations thereunder. Interest shall be payable with respect to the period between—
(A) The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was required to be paid over by the transferee, and
(B) The date on which such tax is actually paid. Interest shall be payable with respect to the entire amount that is required to be deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a withholding certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount, then, for the period after the issuance of the certificate, interest shall be payable with respect to that reduced amount.
(3)
Transferor's liability otherwise satisfied
—(i)
Tax and penalties.
If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, and the transferor's tax liability with respect to the transfer was satisfied (or was established to be zero) by—
(A) The transferor's filing of an income tax return (and payment of any tax due) with respect to the transfer, or
(B) The issuance of a withholding certificate by the Internal Revenue Service establishing that the transferor's maximum tax liability is zero,
then the tax required to be withheld under section 1445 shall not be collected from the transferee. Such transferee's liability for tax, and the requirement that such person file Forms 8288 and 8288-A, shall be deemed to have been satisfied as of the date on which the transferor's income tax return was filed or the withholding certificate was issued. No penalty shall be imposed on or collected from such person for failure to return or pay the tax, unless such failure was fraudulent and for the purpose of evading payment. A transferee that seeks to avoid liability for tax and penalties pursuant to the rule of paragraph (e)(3)(i) must provide sufficient information for the Service to determine whether the transferor's tax liability was satisfied (or was established to be zero).
(ii)
Interest.
If a transferee is required to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 but fails to do so, then such person shall be liable for the payment of interest under section 6601 and regulations thereunder. Such transferee's liability for the payment of interest shall not be excused by reason of the deemed satisfaction, pursuant to subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(3), of the transferee's liability under section
1445, because the deemed satisfaction of that liability is the equivalent of the late payment of a liability, on which interest must be paid. Interest shall be payable with respect to the period between—
(A) The last date on which the tax imposed under section 1445 was required to be paid over, and
(B) The date (established from information supplied to the Service by the transferee) on which any tax due is paid with respect to the transferor's relevant income tax return, or the date the withholding certificate is issued establishing that the transferor's maximum tax liability is zero.
Interest shall be payable with respect to the entire amount that is required to be deducted and withheld. However, if the Service issues a withholding certificate providing for withholding of a reduced amount, then for the period after the issuance of the certificate interest shall be payable with respect to that reduced amount.
(4)
Coordination with entity with holding rules.
For purposes of section 1445(e) and §§ 1.1445-5, 1.1445-6, 1.1445-7, and 1.1445-8T, the rules of this paragraph (e) shall be applied by—
(i) Substituting the words “person required to withhold” for the word “transferee” each place it appears in this paragraph (e), and
(ii) Substituting the words “person subject to withholding” for the word “transferor” each place it appears in this paragraph (e).
(f)
Effect of withholding on transferor
—(1)
In general.
The withholding of tax under section 1445(a) does not excuse a foreign person that disposes of a U.S. real property interest from filing a U.S. tax return with respect to the income arising from the disposition. Form 1040NR, 1041, or 1120F, as appropriate, must be filed, and any tax due must be paid, by the filing deadline generally applicable to such person. (The return may be filed by such later date as is provided in an extension granted by the Internal Revenue Service.) Any tax withheld under section 1445(a) shall be credited against the amount of income tax as computed in such return.
(2)
Manner of obtaining credit or refund.
A stamped copy of Form 8288-A will be provided to the transferor by the Service (under paragraph (c) of this section) if the Form 8288-A is complete, including the transferor's identifying number. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, a stamped copy of Form 8288-A must be attached to the transferor's return to establish the amount withheld that is available as a credit. If the amount withheld under section 1445(a) constitutes less than the full amount of the transferor's U.S. tax liability for that taxable year, then a payment of estimated tax may be required to be made pursuant to section 6154 or 6654 prior to the filing of the income tax return for that year. Alternatively, if the amount withheld under section 1445(a) exceeds the transferor's maximum tax liability with respect to the disposition (as determined by the IRS), then the transferor may seek an early refund of the excess pursuant to § 1.1445-3(g), or a normal refund upon the filing of a tax return.
(3)
Special rules
—(i)
Failure to receive Form 8288-A.
If a stamped copy of Form 8288-A has not been provided to the transferor by the Service, the transferor may establish the amount of tax withheld by the transferee by attaching to its return substantial evidence (e.g., closing documents) of such amount. Such a transferor must attach to its return a statement which supplies all of the information required by § 1.1445-1(d), including the transferor's identifying number.
(ii)
U.S. persons subjected to withholding.
If a transferee withholds tax under section 1445(a) with respect to a person who is not a foreign person, such person may credit the amount of any tax withheld against his income tax liability in accordance with the provisions of this § 1.1145-1(f) or apply for an early refund under § 1.1445-3(g).
(iii)
Refund in case of installment sale.
A transferor that takes gain into account in accordance with the provisions of section 453 shall not be entitled to a refund of the amount withheld, unless a withholding certificate providing for such a refund is obtained from the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1445-3.
(iv)
Joint foreign transferors.
If two or more foreign persons jointly transfer a
U.S. real property interest, each transferor shall be credited with such portion of the amount withheld as such transferors mutually agree. Such transferors must request that the transferee reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the amount withheld on the Forms 8288-A filed by the transferee. If the foreign transferors fail to request that the transferee reflect the agreed-upon crediting of the amount withheld by the 10th day after the date of transfer, the transferee must credit the amount withheld equally between (or among) the foreign transferors. In such case, the transferee is indemnified pursuant to section 1461 against any claim by a transferor objecting to the resulting division of credits. For rules regarding the amount realized allocated to joint foreign and non-foreign transferors, see § 1.1445-1(b)(2).
(g)
Definitions
—(1)
In general.
Unless otherwise specified, the definitions of terms provided in § 1.897-1 shall apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.1445-2 through 1.1445-7. For purposes of section 1445 and the regulations thereunder, definitions of other relevant terms are provided in this paragraph (g). In addition, the term “residence” is defined in 1.1445-2(d)(1), the terms “transferor's agent” and “transferee's agent” are defined in 1.1445-4(f), and the term “relevant taxpayer” is defined in 1.1445-6(a)(2).
(2)
Transfer.
The term “transfer” means any transaction that would constitute a disposition for any purpose, of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. For purposes of §§ 1.1445-5 and 1.1445-6, the term includes distribution to shareholders of a corporation, partners of a partnership and beneficiaries of a trust or estate.
(3)
Transferor.
The term “transferor” means any person, foreign or domestic, that disposes of a U.S. real property interest by sale, exchange, gift, or any other transfer. The term “U.S. real property interest” is defined in § 1.897-1(c).
(4)
Transferee.
The term “transferee” means any person, foreign or domestic, that acquires a U.S. real property interest by purchase, exchange, gift, or any other transfer.
(5)
Amount realized.
The amount realized by the transferor for the transfer of a U.S. real property interest is the sum of.
(i) The cash paid, or to be paid.
(ii) The fair market value of other property transferred, or to be transferred, and
(iii) The outstanding amount of any liability assumed by the transferee or to which the U.S. real property interest is subject immediately before and after the transfer.
The term “cash paid or to be paid” does not include stated or unstated interest or original issue discount (as determined under the rules of sections 1271 through 1275).
(6)
Contract price.
The contract price of a U.S. real property interest is the sum that is agreed to by the transferee and transferor as the total amount of consideration to be paid for the property. That amount will generally be equal to the amount realized by the transferor, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(7)
Fair market value.
The fair market value of property means the price at which the property would change hands between an unrelated willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts.
(8)
Date of transfer.
The date of transfer of a U.S. real property interest is the first date on which consideration is paid (or a liability assumed) by the transferee. However, for purposes of section 1445(e) (2), (3), and (4) and §§ 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii) and 1.1445-5(c)(3) only, the date of transfer is the date of the distribution that gives rise to the obligation to withhold. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(8), the payment of consideration does not include the payment, prior to the passage of legal or equitable title (other than pursuant to an initial contract for purchase), of earnest money, a good-faith deposit, or any similar sum that is primarily intended to bind the transferee or transferor to the entering or performance of a contract. Such a payment will not constitute a payment of consideration solely because it may ultimately be applied against the amount owed to the transferor by the transferee. Such a payment is presumed to be earnest
money, a good faith deposit, or a similar sum if it is subject to forfeiture in the event of a failure to enter into a contract or a breach of contract. However, a payment that is not forfeitable may nevertheless be found to constitute earnest money, a good faith deposit, or a similar sum.
(9)
Identifying number.
Pursuant to § 1.897-1(p), an individual's identifying number is the social security number or the identification number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 301.6109-1 of this chapter). The identifying number of any other person is its United States employer identification number.
(10)
Address for correspondence.
Any written communication to the Internal Revenue Service described in this section is to be mailed to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading “Where To File.”
(11)
Withholding qualified holder.
A withholding qualified holder means a qualified holder (under § 1.897(l)-1(d)), and a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders (under § 1.897(l)-1(d)), including through one or more partnerships.
(h)
Applicability dates.
The requirement in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B), (d)(1)(i) and (ii), (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(iv)(B), and (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring after November 3, 2003. The withholding rates set forth in paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(iii), (c)(2)(i)(A), and (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section apply to dispositions after February 16, 2016. For dispositions on or before February 16, 2016, see paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(3)(iii), (c)(2)(i)(A), and (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2015.
[T.D. 8113, 51 FR 46629, Dec. 24, 1986; 52 FR 3796, 3916, Feb. 6, 1987, as amended by T.D. 8647, 60 FR 66076, Dec. 21, 1995; T.D. 9082, 68 FR 46084, Aug. 5, 2003; T.D. 9751, 81 FR 8400, Feb. 19, 2016; T.D. 9971, 87 FR 80065, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 1.1445-2
Situations in which withholding is not required under section 1445(a).
(a)
Purpose and scope of section.
This section provides rules concerning various situations in which withhold is not required under section 1445(a). In general, a transferee has a duty to withhold under section 1445(a) only if both of the following are true:
(1) The transferor is a foreign person; and
(2) The transferee is acquiring a U.S. real property interest.
Thus, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provide rules under which a transferee of property can ascertain that he has no duty to withhold because one or the other of the two key elements is missing. Under paragraph (b), a transferee may determine that no withholding is required because the transferor is not a foreign person. Under paragraph (c), a transferee may determine that no withholding is required because the property acquired is not a U.S. real property interest. Finally, paragraph (d) of this section provides rules concerning exceptions to the withholding requirement.
(b)
Transferor not a foreign person
—(1)
In general.
No withholding is required under section 1445 if the transferor of a U.S. real property interest is not a foreign person. Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides rules pursuant to which the transferor can provide a certification of non-foreign status to inform the transferee that withholding is not required. A transferee that obtains such a certification must retain that document for five years, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the obtaining of this certification excuses the transferee from any liability otherwise imposed by section 1445 and § 1.1445-1(e). However, section 1445 and the rules of this section do not impose any obligation upon a transferee to obtain a certification from the transferor, thus, a transferee may instead rely upon other means to ascertain the non-foreign status of the transferor. If, however, the transferee relies upon other means and the transferor was, in
fact, a foreign person, then the transferee is subject to the liability imposed by section 1445 and § 1.1445-1(e).
A transferee is in no event required to rely upon other means to ascertain the non-foreign status of the transferor and may demand a certification of non-foreign status. If the certification is not provided, the transferee may withhold tax under section 1445 and will be considered, for purposes of sections 1461 through 1463, to have been required to withhold such tax.
(2)
Transferor's certification of non-foreign status
—(i)
In general.
The rules in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) apply for purposes of the transferor's certification of non-foreign status (including a certification of non-foreign status provided by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)).
(A) A transferee of a U.S. real property interest is not required to withhold under section 1445(a) if, before or at the time of the transfer, the transferor furnishes to the transferee a certification that is signed under penalties of perjury and—
(
1
) States that the transferor is not a foreign person; and
(
2
) Sets forth the transferor's name, identifying number and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity).
(B) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a foreign person is a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate, except that a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) is not a foreign person. Additionally, a foreign corporation that has made a valid election under section 897(i) is generally not treated as a foreign person for purposes of section 1445. In this regard, see § 1.1445-7. Pursuant to § 1.897-1(p), an individual's identifying number is the individual's Social Security number and any other person's identifying number is its U.S. employer identification number (EIN), or, if the transferor is a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) that does not have a U.S. taxpayer identification number, a foreign tax identification number issued by its jurisdiction of residence. A certification pursuant to this paragraph (b) must be verified as true and signed under penalties of perjury by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee, executor, or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. No particular form is needed for a certification pursuant to this paragraph (b), nor is any particular language required, so long as the document meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), except that, with respect to a certification submitted by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)), the transferor must state on the certification that it is treated as a non-foreign person because it is a withholding qualified holder and must further specify whether it qualifies as a withholding qualified holder because it is a qualified holder under § 1.897(l)-1(d) or a foreign partnership that satisfies the requirements of § 1.1445-1(g)(11). Samples of acceptable certifications are provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Foreign corporation that “has made election under section 897(i).
A foreign corporation that has made a valid election under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 897 may provide a certification of non-foreign status pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2). However, an electing foreign corporation must attach to such certification a copy of the acknowledgment of the election provided to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 1.897-3(d)(4).
An acknowledgment is valid for this purpose only if it states that the information required by § 1.897-3 has been determined to be complete.
(iii)
Disregarded entities.
A disregarded entity may not certify that it is the transferor of a U.S. real property interest, as the disregarded entity is not the transferor for U.S. tax purposes, including sections 897 and 1445. Rather, the owner of the disregarded entity is treated as the transferor of property and must provide a certificate of non-foreign status to avoid withholding under section 1445. A disregarded entity for these purposes means an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner
under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter, a qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in section 856(i), or a qualified subchapter S subsidiary under section 1361(b)(3)(B). Any domestic entity must include in its certification of non-foreign status with respect to the transfer a certification that it is not a disregarded entity. This paragraph (b)(2)(iii) and the sample certification provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section (to the extent it addresses disregarded entities) is applicable for dispositions occurring September 4, 2003.
(iv)
Sample certifications
—(A)

For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [name of transferor] , the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of [name of the transferor]:
1. [Name of transferor] is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations);

Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification
, or its successor, submitted to the transferee by the transferor.
(vi)
Form W-8EXP.
A certification of non-foreign status may be made by a withholding qualified holder (as defined under § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section to certify its qualified holder status. A certification of non-foreign status under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section also includes a certification made on a Form W-8EXP (or its successor) that states that the transferor is treated as a non-foreign person because it is a withholding qualified holder and must further specify whether it qualifies as a withholding qualified holder because it is a qualified holder under § 1.897(l)-1(d) or a foreign partnership that satisfies the requirements of § 1.1445-1(g)(11). The certification must also meet all of the other requirements for a valid Form W-8EXP (or its successor) as provided on the form and the instructions to the form. A qualified holder may not provide a certification of non-foreign status on a Form W-9 (or its successor) as permitted in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
(3)
Transferee must retain certification.
If a transferee obtains a transferor's certification pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (b), then the transferee must retain that certification until the end of the fifth taxable year following the taxable year in which the transfer takes place. The transferee must retain the certification, and make it available
to the Internal Revenue Service when requested in accordance with the requirements of section 6001 and regulations thereunder.
(4)
Reliance upon certification not permitted
—(i)
In general.
A transferee may not rely upon a transferor's certification pursuant to this paragraph (b) under the circumstances set forth in either subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4). In either of those circumstances, a transferee's withholding obligation shall apply as if a certification had never been obtained, and the transferee is fully liable pursuant to section 1445 and § 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.
(ii)
Failure to attach IRS acknowledgment of election.
A transferee that knows that the transferor is a foreign corporation may not rely upon a certification of non-foreign status provided by the corporation on the basis of election under section 897(i), unless there is attached to the certification a copy of the acknowledgment by the Internal Revenue Service of the corporation's election, as required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Knowledge of falsity.
A transferee is not entitled to rely upon a transferor's certification if prior to or at the time of the transfer the transferee either—
(A) Has actual knowledge that the transferor's certification is false; or
(B) Receives a notice that the certification is false from a transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to § 1.1445-4.
(iv)
Belated notice of false certification.
If after the date of the transfer a transferee receives a notice that a certification is false, then that transferee is entitled to rely upon the certification only with respect to consideration that was paid prior to receipt for the notice. Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 15 percent of the amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to the transferor if possible. Thus, if 15 percent or more of the amount realized remains to be paid to the transferor then the transferee is required to withhold and pay over the full 15 percent. The transferee must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each successive payment of consideration to the transferor until the full 15 percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee that is subject to the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv) may not obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to § 1.1445-3, but must instead withhold and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph. For dispositions described in § 1.1445-1(b)(2), this paragraph shall be applied by replacing “15 percent” with “10 percent” each time it appears.
(c)
Transferred property not a U.S. real property interest
—(1)
In general.
No withholding is required under section 1445 if the transferee acquires only property that is not a U.S. real property interest. As defined in section 897(c) and § 1.897-1(c), a U.S. real property interest includes certain interests in U.S. corporations, as well as direct interests in real property and certain associated personal property. This paragraph (c) provides rules pursuant to which a person acquiring an interest in a U.S. corporation may determine that withholding is not required because that interest is not a U.S. real property interest. To determine whether an interest in tangible property constitutes a U.S. real property interest the acquisition of which would be subject to withholding, see § 1.897-1 (b) and (c).
(2)
Interests in publicly traded entities.
No withholding is required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a domestic corporation if any class of stock of the corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market.
This exemption shall apply if the disposition is incident to an initial public offering of stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly, no withholding is required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a publicly traded partnership or trust. However, the rule of this paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to the acquisition, from a single transferor in a single (or related transferors (as defined in § 1.897-1(i)) transaction (or related transactions), of an interest
described in § 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii)(B) (relating to substantial amounts of non-publicly traded interests in publicly traded corporations) or to similar interests in publicly traded partnerships or trusts. The person making an acquisition described in the preceding sentence must otherwise determine whether withholding is required, pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder. Transactions shall be deemed to be related if they are undertaken within 90 days of one another or if it can otherwise be shown that they were undertaken in pursuance of a prearranged plan.
(3)
Transferee receives statement that interest in corporation is not a U.S. real property interest
—(i)
In general.
No withholding is required under section 1445(a) upon the acquisition of an interest in a domestic corporation, if the transferor provides the transferee with a copy of a statement, issued by the corporation pursuant to § 1.897-2(h), certifying that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest, or if the transferor provides the transferee with a statement certifying that the corporation is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity (as determined under § 1.897-1(c)(3)) that is voluntarily issued by the corporation but otherwise complies with the requirements of § 1.897-2(h). In general, a corporation may issue such a statement only if the corporation was not a U.S. real property holding corporation at any time during the previous five years (or the period in which the interest was held by its present holder, if shorter), the corporation is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity (as determined under § 1.897-1(c)(3)), or if interests in the corporation ceased to be United States real property interests under section 897(c)(1)(B). (A corporation may not provide such a statement based on its determination that the interest in question is an interest solely as a creditor.)
See
§ 1.897-2(f) and (h). The corporation may provide such a statement directly to the transferee at the transferor's request. The transferor must request such a statement before the transfer, and shall, to the extent possible, specify the anticipated date of the transfer. A corporation's statement may be relied upon for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) only if the statement is dated not more than 30 days before the date of the transfer. A transferee may also rely upon a corporation's statement that is voluntarily provided by the corporation in response to a request from the transferee, if that statement otherwise complies with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) and § 1.897-2(h).
(ii)
Reliance on statement not permitted.
A transferee is not entitled to rely upon a statement that a corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation if, prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee either—
(A) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or
(B) Receives a notice that the statement is false from a transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to § 1.1445-4.
Such a transferee's withholding obligations shall apply as if a statement had never been given, and such a transferee may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.
(iii)
Belated notice of false statement.
If after the date of the transfer, a transferee receives notice that a statement provided under § 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i) (that an interest in a corporation is not a U.S. real property interest) is false, then such transferee may rely on the statement only with respect to consideration that was paid prior to the receipt of the notice.
Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 15 percent of the amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to the transferor, if possible. Thus, if 15 percent or more of the amount realized remains to be paid to the transferor, then the transferee is required to withhold and pay over the full 15 percent. The transferee must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each successive payment of consideration to the transferor, until the full 15 percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee that is subject to the rules of this § 1.1445-2(c)(3)(iii) may not obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to § 1.1445-3, but must instead withhold
and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph.
(d)
Exceptions to requirement of withholding
—(1)
Purchase of residence for $300,000 or less.
No withholding is required under section 1445(a) if one or more individual transferees acquire a U.S. real property interest for use as a residence and the amount realized on the transaction is $300,000 or less. For purposes of this section, a U.S. real property interest is acquired for use as a residence if on the date of the transfer the transferee (or transferees) has definite plans to reside at the property for at least 50 percent of the number of days that the property is used by any person during each of the first two 12-month periods following the date of the transfer. The number of days that the property will be vacant is not taken into account in determining the number of days such property is used by any person. A transferee shall be considered to reside at a property on any day on which a member of the transferee's family, as defined in section 267(c)(4), resides at the property. No form or other document need be filed with the Internal Revenue Service to establish a transferee's entitlement to rely upon the exception provided by this paragraph (d)(1). A transferee who fails to withhold in reliance upon this exception, but who does not in fact reside at the property for the minimum number of days set forth above, shall be liable for the failure to withhold (if the transferor was a foreign person and did not pay the full U.S. tax due on any gain recognized upon the transfer). However, if the transferee establishes that the failure to reside the minimum number of days was caused by a change in circumstances that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the transfer, then the transferee shall not be liable for the failure to withhold.
The exception provided by paragraph (d)(1) does not apply in any case where the transferee is other than an individual even if the property is acquired for or on behalf of an individual who will use the property as a residence. However, this exception applies regardless of the organizational structure of the transferor (i.e., regardless of whether the transferor is an individual, partnership, trust, corporation, etc.).
(2)
Coordination with nonrecognition provisions
—(i)
In general.
A transferee shall not be required to withhold under section 1445(a) with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest if—
(A) The transferor notifies the transferee, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, that by reason of the operation of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the provisions of any United States treaty the transferor is not required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer, and
(B) By the 20th day after the date of the transfer the transferee mails a copy of the transferor's notice to the Internal Revenue Service, at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10), together with a cover letter setting forth the name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the transferee providing the notice to the Service. The rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(i) is subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) a nonrecognition provision is any provision of the Internal Revenue Code for not recognizing gain or loss.
(ii)
Exceptions.
A transferee may not rely upon the rule of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, and must therefore withhold under section 1445(a) with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest, if either:
(A) The transferor qualifies for nonrecognition treatment with respect to part, but not all, of the gain realized by the transferor upon the transfer, or
(B) The transferee knows or has reason to know that the transferor is not entitled to the nonrecognition treatment claimed by the transferor.
In either of the above circumstances the transferee or transferor may request a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the rules of § 1.1445-3.
(iii)
Contents of the notice.
No particular form is required for a transferor's notice to a transferee that the transferor is not required to recognize gain or loss with respect to a transfer.
The notice must be verified as true and signed under penalties of perjury by the transferor, by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. The following information must be set forth in paragraphs labeled to correspond with the designation set forth as follows—
(A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of a nonrecognition transaction or a treaty provision pursuant to the requirements of § 1.1445-2(d)(2);
(B) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the transferor submitting the notice;
(C) A statement that the transferor is not required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer;
(D) A brief description of the transfer; and
(E) A brief summary of the law and facts supporting the claim that recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the transfer.
(iv)
No notice allowed.
The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) do not apply to exclusions from income under section 121, to simultaneous like-kind exchanges under section 1031 that do not qualify for nonrecognition treatment in their entirety (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section), and to non-simultaneous like-kind exchanges under section 1031 where the transferee cannot determine that the exchange has been completed and all the conditions for nonrecognition have been satisfied at the time it is otherwise required to pay the section 1445 withholding tax and file the withholding tax return (Form 8288, “U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests”). In these cases, the transferee is excused from withholding only upon the timely application for and receipt of a withholding certificate under § 1.1445-3 (see § 1.1445-3(b)(5) and (6) for specific rules applicable to transactions under sections 121 and 1031). This paragraph (d)(2)(iv) is applicable for dispositions and exchanges occurring September 4, 2003.
(3)
Special procedural rules applicable to foreclosures
—(i)
Amount to be withheld
—(A)
foreclosures.
A transferee that acquires a U.S. real property interest pursuant to a repossession or foreclosure on such property under a mortgage, security agreement, deed of trust or other instrument securing a debt must withhold tax under section 1445(a) equal to 15 percent (10 percent in the case of dispositions described in § 1.1445-1(b)(2)) of the amount realized on such sale. Such amount must be reported and paid over to the Service under the general rules of § 1.1445-1. However, if the transferee complies with the notice requirements of § 1.1445-2(d)(3) (ii) and (iii), such transferee may report and pay over to the Service on or before the 20th day following the final determination by a court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action, the lesser of:
(
1
) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under section 1445(a), or
(
2
) The “alternative amount” as defined in the succeeding sentence. The alternative amount is the entire amount, if any, determined by a court or trustee with jurisdiction over the matter, that accrues to the debtor/transferor out of the amount realized from the foreclosure sale. The amount of any mortgage, lien, or other security agreement secured by the property, that is terminated, assumed by another person, or otherwise extinguished (as to the debtor/transferor) shall not be treated as an amount that accrues to the debtor/transferor for purposes of this § 1.1445-2(d)(3)(i)(A). If the alternative amount is zero, no withholding is required. Any difference between the amount withheld at the time of the foreclosure sale and the amount to be reported and paid over to the Service must be transferred to the court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action. Amounts withheld, if any, are to be reported and paid to the Service by using Forms 8288 and 8288-A in conformity with § 1.1445-1(d).
(B)
Deeds in lieu of foreclosures.
A transferee of a U.S. real property interest pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure must withhold tax equal to 15 percent (10 percent in the case of dispositions described in § 1.1445-1(b)(2)) of the amount realized by the debtor/
transferor on the transfer. However, no withholding is required if:
(
1
) The transferee is the only person with a security interest in the property,
(
2
) No cash or other property (other than incidental fees incurred with respect to the transfer) is paid, directly or indirectly, to any person with respect to the transfer, and
(
3
) The notice requirement of § 1.1445-2(d)(3) are satisfied.
The amount withheld, if any, must be reported and paid over to the Service not later than the 20th day following the date of transfer. In a case where withholding would otherwise be required, a withholding certificate may be requested in accordance with § 1.1445-3.
(ii)
Notice to the court or trustee in a foreclosure action
—(A)
Notice on day of purchase.
A transferee in a foreclosure sale that chooses to use the special rules applicable to foreclosures must provide notice to the court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action on the day the property is transferred with respect to such transferee's withholding obligation. No particular form is necessary but the notice must set forth the transferee's name, home address in the case of an individual, office address in the case of an entity, a brief description of the property, the date of the transfer, the amount realized on the sale of the foreclosed property and the amount withheld under section 1445(a).
(B)
Notice whether amount withheld or alternative amount is reported and paid over to the Service.
A purchaser/transferee in a foreclosure that chooses to use the special rules applicable to foreclosures must provide notice to the court or trustee with jurisdiction over the foreclosure action regarding whether the amount withheld or the alternative amount will be (or has been) reported and paid over to the Service. The notice should set forth all the information required by the preceding paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A), the amount withheld or alternative amount that will be (or has been) reported and paid over to the Service, and the amount that will be (or has been) paid over to the court or trustee.
(iii)
Notice to the Service
—(A)
General rule.
A transferee that in reliance upon the rules of this paragraph (d)(3) withholds an alternative amount (or does not withhold because the alternative amount is zero) must, on or before the 20th day following the final determination by a court or trustee in a foreclosure action or on or before the 20th day following the date of the transfer with respect to a transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provide notice thereof to the Assistant Commissioner (International) at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). (The filing of such a notice shall not relieve a creditor of any obligation it may have to file a notice pursuant to section 6050J and the regulations thereunder.) No particular form is required but the following information must be set forth in paragraphs labelled to correspond with the numbers set forth below.
(
1
) A statement that the notice constitutes a notice of foreclosure action or transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure under § 1.1445-2(d)(3).
(
2
) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the purchaser/transferee.
(
3
) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of the debtor/transferor.
(
4
) In a foreclosure action, the date of the final determination by a court or trustee regarding the distribution of the amount realized from the foreclosure sale. In a transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the date the property is transferred to the purchaser/transferee.
(
5
) A brief description of the property.
(
6
) The amount realized from the foreclosure sale or with respect to the transfer pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
(
7
) The alternative amount.
(B)
Special rule for lenders required to file Form 1099-A where the alternative amount is zero.
A person required under section 6050J to file Form 1099-A does not have to comply with the notice requirement of § 1.1445-2(d)(3)(iii)(A) if the alternative amount is zero. In such
case, the filing of the Form 1099-A will be deemed to satisfy the notice requirements of § 1.1445-2(d)(3)(iii)(A).
(iv)
Requirements not applicable.
A transferee is not required to withhold tax or provide notice pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (d)(3) if no substantive withholding liability applies to the transfer of the property by the debtor/transferor. For example, if the debtor/transferor provides the transferee with a certification of non-foreign status pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, then no substantive withholding liability would exist with respect to the acquisition of the property from the debtor transferor. In such a case, no withholding of tax or notice to the Internal Revenue Service is required of the transferee with respect to the repossession or foreclosure.
(v)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a U.S. real property interest is transferred in foreclosure or pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure for a principal purpose of avoiding the requirements of section 1445(a), then the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) shall not apply to the transfer and the transferee shall be fully liable for any failure to withhold with respect to the transfer. A principal purpose to avoid section 1445(a) will be presumed (subject to rebuttal on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances) if:
(A) The transferee acquires property in which it, or a related party, has a security interest;
(B) The security interest did not arise in connection with the debtor/transferor's or a related party's or predecessor in interest's acquisition, improvement, or maintenance of the property; and
(C) The total amount of all debts secured by the property exceeds 90 percent of the fair market value of the property.
(4)
Installment payments.
A transferee of a U.S. real property interest is not required to withhold under section 1445 when making installment payments on an obligation arising out of a dispositions that took place before January 1, 1985. With respect to disposition that take place after December 31, 1984, the transferee shall be required to satisfy its entire withholding obligation within the time specified in § 1.1445-1(c) regardless of the amount actually paid by the transferee. Thereafter, no withholding is required upon further installment payments on an obligation arising out of the transfer. A transferee that is unable to satisfy its entire withholding obligation within the time specified in § 1.1445-1(c) may request a withholding certificate pursuant to § 1.1445-3.
(5)
Acquisitions by governmental bodies.
No withholding of tax is required under section 1445 with respect to any acquisition of property by the United States, a state or possession of the United States, a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.
(6) [Reserved]
(7)
Withholding certificate obtained by transferee or transferor.
No withholding is required under section 1445(a) if the transferee is provided with a withholding certificate that so specifies. Either the transferor or the transferee may seek a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1445-3.
(8)
Amount realized by transferor is zero.
If the amount realized by transferor on a transfer of a U.S. real property interest is zero, no withholding is required.
(e)
Applicability dates.
The requirement in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B), (d)(2)(iii)(B), and (d)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring after November 3, 2003.

§ 1.1445-3
Adjustments to amount required to be withheld pursuant to withholding certificate.
(a)
In general.
Withholding under section 1445(a) may be reduced or eliminated pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the rules of this section. A withholding certificate may be issued by the Service in cases where reduced withholding is appropriate (see paragraph (c) of this section), where the transferor is exempt from U.S. tax (see paragraph (d) of this section), or where an agreement for the payment of tax is entered into with the Service (see paragraph (e) of this section). A withholding certificate that is obtained prior to a transfer notifies the transferee that no withholding is required. A withholding certificate that is obtained after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or an early refund pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. Either a transferee or transferor may apply for a withholding certificate. The Internal Revenue Service will act upon an application for a withholding certificate not later than the 90th day after it is received. Solely for this purpose (i.e., determining the day upon which the 90-day period commences), an application is received by the Service on the date that all information necessary for the Service to make a determination is provided by the applicant. In no event, however, will a withholding certificate be issued without the transferor's identifying number. (For rules regarding whether an application for a withholding certificate has been timely submitted, see § 1.445-1(c)(2).) The Service may deny a request for a withholding certificate where, after due notice, an applicant fails to provide information necessary for the Service to make a determination. The Service will act upon an application for an early refund not later than the 90th day after it is received. An application for an early refund must either (1) include a copy of a withholding certificate issued by the Service with respect to the transaction or, (2) be combined with an application for a withholding certificate. Where an application for an early refund is combined with an application for a withholding certificate, the Service will act upon both applications not later than the 90th day after receipt. In the case of an application for a certificate based on non-conforming security under paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section, and in unusually complicated cases, the Service may be unable to provide a final withholding certificate by the 90th day. In such a case the Service will notify the applicant, by the 45th day after receipt of the application, that additional processing time will be necessary. The Service's notice may request additional information or explanation concerning particular aspects of the application, and will provide a target date for final action (contingent upon the application's timely submission of any requested information). A withholding certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of this section serves to fulfill the requirements of section 1445(b)(4) concerning qualifying statements, section 1445(c)(1) concerning the transferor's maximum tax liability, or section 1445(c)(2) concerning the Secretary's authority to prescribe reduced withholding.
(b)
Applications for withholding certificates
—(1)
In general.
An application for a withholding certificate must be submitted to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). An application for a withholding certificate must be signed by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, by a trustee, executor, or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate, and in the case of an individual by the individual himself. A duly authorized agent may sign the application but the application must contain a valid power of attorney authorizing the agent to sign the application on behalf of the applicant. The person signing the application must verify under penalties of perjury that all representations made in connection with the application are true, correct, and complete to his knowledge and belief. No particular form is required for an application, but the application must set forth the information described in paragraphs (b), (2), (3), and (4), and to the extent applicable, paragraph (b)(5) or (6) of this section.
(2)
Parties to the transaction.
The application must set forth the name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the application (specifying whether that person is the transferee or transferor), and the name, address, and identifying number of other parties to the transaction (specifying whether each such party is a transferee or transferor). The Service will deny the application if complete information, including the identifying numbers of all the parties, is not provided. Thus, for example, the applicant should determine if an identifying number exists for each party, and, if none exists for a particular party, the applicant should notify the particular party of the obligation to get an identifying number before the application can be submitted to the Service. The address provided in the case of an individual must be that individual's home address, and the address provided in the case of an entity must be that entity's office address. A mailing address may be provided in addition to, but not in lieu of, a home address or office address.
(3)
Real property interest to be transferred.
The application must set forth information concerning the U.S. real property interest with respect to which the withholding certificate is sought, including the type of interest, the contract price, and, in the case of an interest in real property, its location and general description, or in the case of an interest in a U.S. real property holding corporation, the class or type and amount of the interest.
(4)
Basis for certificate
—(i)
Reduced withholding.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of a claim that reduced withholding in appropriate, the application must include:
(A) A calculation of the maximum tax that may be imposed on the disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such calculation must be accompanied by a copy of the relevant contract and depreciation schedules or other evidence that confirms the contract price and adjusted basis of the property. If no depreciation schedules are provided, the application must state the nature of the use of the property and why depreciation was not allowable. Evidence that supports any claimed adjustment to the maximum tax on the disposition must also be provided;
(B) A calculation of the transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability, or evidence supporting the claim that no such liability exists, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(C) In the case of a request for a special reduction of withholding pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a statement of law and facts in support of the request.
(ii)
Exemption.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of the transferor's exemption from U.S. tax, the application must set forth a brief statement of the law and facts that support the claimed exemption. In this regard, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Agreement.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of an agreement for the payment of tax, the application must include a signed copy
of the agreement proposed by the applicant and a copy of the security instrument (if any) proposed by the applicant. In this regard, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(5)
Special rule for exclusions from income under section 121.
A withholding certificate may be sought on the basis of a section 121 exclusion as a reduction in the amount of tax due under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. The application must include information establishing that the transferor, who is a nonresident alien individual at the time of the sale (and is therefore subject to sections 897 and 1445) is entitled to claim the benefits of section 121. For example, a claim for reduced withholding as a result of section 121 must include information that the transferor occupied the U.S. real property interest as his or her personal residence for the required period of time.
(6)
Special rule for like-kind exchanges under Section 1031.
A withholding certificate may be requested with respect to a like-kind exchange under section 1031 as a transaction subject to a nonrecognition provision under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The application must include information substantiating the requirements of section 1031. The IRS may require additional information during the course of the application process to determine that the requirements of section 1031 are satisfied. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, the withholding agent is excused from reporting and paying the withholding tax to the IRS within 20 days after the transfer only if an application for a withholding certificate is submitted prior to or on the date of transfer. See § 1.1445-1(c)(2) for rules concerning delayed reporting and payment where an application for a withholding certificate has been submitted to the IRS prior to or on the date of transfer.
(c)
Adjustment of amount required to be withheld
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding certificate that excuses withholding or that permits the transferee to withhold an adjusted amount reflecting the transferor's maximum tax liability. The transferor's maximum tax liability is the sum of—
(i) The maximum amount which could be imposed as tax under section 871 or 882 upon the transferor's disposition of the subject real property interest, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and
(ii) The transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability with respect to the subject real property interest, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding certificate that permits the transferee to withhold a reduced amount if the Service determines pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section that reduced withholding will not jeopardize the collection of tax.
(2)
Maximum tax imposed on disposition.
The first element of the transferor's maximum tax liability is the maximum amount which the transferor could be required to pay as tax upon the disposition of the subject real property interest. In the case of an individual transferor that amount will generally be the contract price of the property minus its adjusted basis, multiplied by the maximum individual income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. In the case of a corporate transferor, that amount will generally be the contract price of the property minus its adjusted basis, multiplied by the maximum corporate income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. However, that amount must be adjusted to take into account the following:
(i) Any reduction of tax to which the transferor is entitled under the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty;
(ii) The effect of any nonrecognition provision that is applicable to the transaction;
(iii) Any losses realized and recognized upon the previous disposition of U.S. real property interests during the taxable year;
(iv) Any amount that is required to be treated as ordinary income; and
(v) Any other factor that may increase or reduce the tax upon the disposition.
(3)
Transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability
—(i)
In general.
The second element of the transferor's maximum tax liability is the transferor's unsatisfied
withholding liability. That liability is the amount of any tax that the transferor was required to but did not withhold and pay over under section 1445 upon the acquisition of the subject U.S. real property interest or a predecessor interest. The transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability is included in the calculation of maximum tax liability so that such prior withholding liability can be satisfied by the transferee's withholding upon the current transfer. Alternatively, the transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability may be disregarded for purposes of calculating the maximum tax liability, if either—
(A) Such prior withholding liability is fully satisfied by a payment that is made with the application submitted pursuant to this section; or
(B) An agreement is entered into for the payment of that liability pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e) of this section.
Because section 1445 only requires withholding after December 31, 1984, no transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability can exist unless the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor real property interest after that date. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a predecessor interest is one that was exchanged for the subject U.S. real property interest in a transaction in which the transferor was not required to recognize the full amount of the gain or loss realized upon the transfer.
(ii)
Evidence that no unsatisfied withholding liability exists.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section (concerning information that must be submitted with an application for a withholding certificate), evidence that the transferor has no unsatisfied withholding liability includes any one of the following documents:
(A) Evidence that the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor real property interest prior to January 1, 1985;
(B) A copy of the Form 8288 that was filed by the transferor, and proof of payment of the amount shown due thereon, with respect to the transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property interest;
(C) A copy of a withholding certificate with respect to the transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property interest, plus a copy of Form 8288 and proof of payment with respect to any withholding required under that certificate;
(D) A copy of the non-foreign certification furnished by the person from whom the subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest was acquired, executed at the time of that acquisition;
(E) Evidence that the transferor purchased the subject or predecessor real property for $300,000 or less, and a statement signed by the transferor under penalties of perjury, that the transferor purchased the property for use as a residence within the meaning of § 1.1445-2(d)(1);
(F) Evidence that the person from whom the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest fully paid any tax imposed on that transaction pursuant to section 897.
(G) A copy of a notice of nonrecognition treatment provided to the transferor pursuant to § 1.1445-2(d)(2) by person from whom the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest; and
(H) A statement, signed by the transferor under penalties of perjury, setting forth the facts and circumstances that supported the transferor's conclusion that no withholding was required under section 1445(a) with respect to the transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property interest.
(4)
Special reduction of amount required to be withheld.
The Internal Revenue Service may, in its discretion, issue a withholding certificate that permits the transferee to withhold a reduced amount based upon a determination that reduced withholding will not jeopardize the collection of tax. A transferor that requests a withholding certificate pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) is required pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section to submit a statement of law and facts in support of the request. That statement must explain why the transferor is unable to enter into an agreement for the payment of tax pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
(d)
Transferor's exemption from U.S. tax
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses all withholding by a transferee if it is established that:
(i) The transferor's gain from the disposition of the subject U.S. real property interest will be exempt from U.S. tax, and
(ii) The transferor has no unsatisfied withholding liability.
For the available exemptions, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A transferor that is entitled to a reduction of (rather than an exemption from) U.S. tax may obtain a withholding certificate to that effect pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Available exemptions.
A transferor's gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest may be exempt from U.S. tax because either:
(i) The transferor is an integral part or controlled entity of a foreign government and the disposition of the subject property is not a commercial activity, as determined pursuant to section 892 and the regulations thereunder; or
(ii) The transferor is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for such an exemption (subject to the limitations imposed by section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 96-499, which, in general, overrides such benefits as of January 1, 1985).
(e)
Agreement for the payment of tax
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses withholding or that permits a transferee to withhold a reduced amount, if either the transferee or the transferor enters into an agreement for the payment of tax pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e). An agreement for the payment of tax is a contract between the Service and any other person that consists of two necessary elements. Those elements are—
(i) A contract between the Service and the other person, setting forth in detail the rights and obligations of each; and
(ii) A security instrument or other form of security acceptable to the Director, Foreign Operations District.
(2)
Contents of agreement
—(i)
In general.
An agreement for the payment of tax must cover an amount described in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (e)(2). The agreement may either provide adequate security for the payment of the chosen amount in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, or provide for the payment of that amount through a combination of security and withholding of tax by the transferee.
(ii)
Tax that would otherwise be withheld.
An agreement for the payment of tax may cover the amount of tax that would otherwise be required to be withheld pursuant to section 1445(a). In addition to the amount computed pursuant to section 1445(a), the applicant must agree to pay interest upon that amount, at the rate established under section 6621, with respect to the period between the date on which the tax imposed by section 1445(a) would otherwise be due (
i.e.,
the 20th day after the date of transfer) and the date on which the transferor's payment of tax with respect to the disposition will be due under the agreement. The amount of interest agreed upon must be paid by the applicant regardless of whether or not the Service is required to draw upon any security provided pursuant to the agreement. The interest may be paid either with the return or by the Service drawing upon the security.
(iii)
Maximum tax liability.
An agreement for the payment of tax may cover the transferor's maximum tax liability, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must also provide for the payment of an additional amount equal to 25 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This additional amount secures the interest and penalties that would accrue between the date of a failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the disposition, and the date on which the Service collects upon that liability pursuant to the agreement. Such additional amount will only be collected if the Service finds it necessary to draw upon any security provided due to the transferor's failure to file a return and
pay tax with respect to the relevant disposition.
(3)
Major types of security
—(i)
In general.
The following are the major types of security acceptable to the Service. Further details with respect to the terms and conditions of each type may be specified by Revenue Procedure.
(ii)
Bond with surety or guarantor.
The Service may accept as security with respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is executed with a satisfactory surety or guarantor. Only the following persons may act as surety or guarantor for this purpose
(A) A surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds, as listed in Treasury Department Circular No. 570, published annually in the
Federal Register
on the first working day of July;
(B) A person that is engaged within or without the United States in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the principles of § 1.864-4(c)(5), and that is subject to U.S. or foreign local or national regulation of such business, if that person is otherwise acceptable to the Service; and
(C) A person that is engaged within or without the United States in the conduct of an insurance business that is subject to U.S. or foreign local or national regulation, if that person is otherwise acceptable to the Service.
(iii)
Bond with collateral.
The Service may accept as security with respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is secured by acceptable collateral. All collateral must be deposited with a responsible financial institution acting as escrow agent, or, in the Service's discretion, with the Service. Only the following types of collateral are acceptable:
(A) Bonds, notes, or other public debt obligations of the United States, in accordance with the rules of 31 CFR part 225; and
(B) A certified cashier's, or treasurer's check, drawn on an entity acceptable to the Service that is engaged within or without the United States in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the principles of § 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or foreign local or national regulation of such business.
(iv)
Letter of credit.
The Service may accept as security with respect to a transferor's tax liability an irrevocable letter of credit. The Service may accept a letter of credit issued by an entity acceptable to the Service that is engaged within or without the United States in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the principles of § 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or foreign local or national regulation of such business. However, the Director will accept a letter of credit from an entity that is not engaged in trade or business in the United States only if such letter may be drawn on an advising bank within the United States.
(v)
Guarantees and other non-conforming security
—(A)
Guarantee.
The Service may in its discretion accept as security with respect to a transferor's tax liability the applicant's guarantee that it will pay such liability. The Service will in general accept such a guarantee only from a corporation, foreign or domestic, any class of stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market on the date of the transfer.
(B)
Other forms of security.
The Service may in unusual circumstances and at its discretion accept any form of security that if finds to be adequate. An application for a withholding certificate that proposes a form of security that does not conform with any of the preferred types set forth in paragraph (e)(3) (ii) through (iv) of this section or any relevant Revenue Procedure must include:
(
1
) A detailed statement of the facts and circumstances supporting the use of the proposed form of security, and
(
2
) A memorandum of law concerning the validity and enforceability of the proposed form of security.
(4)
Terms of security instrument.
Any security instrument that is furnished pursuant to this section must provide that—
(i) The amount of each deposit of estimated tax that will be required with respect to the gain realized on the subject disposition may be collected by levy upon the security as of the date following the date on which each such
deposit is due (unless such deposit is timely made);
(ii) The entire amount of the liability may be collected by levy upon the security at any time during the nine months following the date on which the payment of tax with respect to the subject disposition is due, subject to release of the security upon the full payment of the tax and any interest and penalties due. If the transferor requests an extension of time to file a return with respect to the disposition, then the Director may require that the term of the security instrument be extended until the date that is nine months after the filing deadline as extended.
(f)
Amendments to application for withholding certificate
—(1)
In general.
An applicant for a withholding certificate may amend an otherwise complete application by submitting an amending statement to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10).

(g)
Early refund of overwithheld amounts.
If a transferor receives a withholding certificate pursuant to this section, and an amount greater than that specified in the certificate was withheld by the transferee, then pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (g) the transferor may apply for a refund (without interest) of the excess amount prior to the date on which the transferor's tax return is due (without extensions). (Any interest payable on refunds issued after the filing of a tax return shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6611 and regulations thereunder.) An application for an early refund must be delivered to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10).

(2) Amount required to be withheld pursuant to the withholding certificate issued by Internal Revenue Service;
(3) Amount withheld by the transferee (attach a copy of Form 8288-A stamped by IRS pursuant to § 1.1445-1(c));
(4) Amount to be refunded to the transferor. An application for an early refund cannot be processed unless the required copy of Form 8288-A (or substantial evidence of the amount withheld in the case of a failure to receive Form 8288-A as provided in § 1.1445-1(f)(3)) is attached to the application. If an application for a withholding certificate based upon the transferor's maximum tax liability is submitted after the transfer takes place, then that application may be combined with an application for an early refund. The Service will act upon a claim for refund within the time limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

[T.D. 8113, 51 FR 46637, Dec. 24, 1986; 52 FR 3796, Feb. 6, 1987; T.D. 9082, 68 FR 46085, Aug. 5, 2003, as amended by T.D. 9751, 81 FR 8401, Feb. 19, 2016]
§ 1.1445-4
Liability of agents.
(a)
Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to transferee.
A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide notice to the transferee if either—
(1) The transferee is furnished with a non-U.S. real property interest statement pursuant to § 1.1445-2(c)(3) and the agent knows that the statement is false; or
(2) The transferee is furnished with a non-foreign certification pursuant to § 1.1445-2(b)(2) and either (i) the agent knows that the certification is false, or (ii) the agent represents a transferor that is a foreign corporation. An agent that represents a transferor that is a foreign corporation is not required to provide notice to the transferee if the foreign corporation provided a non-foreign certification to the transferee prior to such agent's employment and the agent does not know that the corporation did so.
(b)
Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to entity or fiduciary.
A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide notice to an entity or fiduciary that plans to carry out a transaction described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4) if either—
(1) The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-U.S. real property interest statement pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(4)(iii) and the agent knows that such statement is false; or
(2) The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-foreign certification pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(3) (ii) and either (i) the agent knows that such certification is false, or (ii) the agent represents a foreign corporation that made such a certification.
(c)
Procedural requirements
—(1)
Notice to transferee, entity, or fiduciary.
An agent who is required by this section to provide notice must do so in writing as soon as possible after learning of the false certification or statement, but not later than the date of the transfer (prior to the transferee's payment of consideration). If an agent first learns of a false certification or statement after the date of the transfer, notice must be given by the third day following that discovery. The notice must state that the certification or statement is false and may not be relied upon. The notice must also explain the possible consequences to the recipient of a failure to withhold. The notice need not disclose the information on which the agent's statement is based. The following is an example of an acceptable notice.“This is to notify you that you may be required to withhold tax in connection with (
describe transaction
). You have been provided with a certification of non-foreign status (or a non-U.S. real property interest statement) in connection with that transaction. I have learned that that document is false. Therefore, you may not rely upon it as a basis for failing to withhold under section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1445 provides that any person who acquires a U.S. real property interest from a foreign person after February 16, 2016, must withhold a tax equal to 15 percent
(10 percent in the case of dispositions described in § 1.1445-1(b)(2)) of the total purchase price. (The term ‘U.S. real property interest’ includes real property, stock in U.S. corporations whose assets are primarily real property, and some personal property associated with realty.) Any person who is required to withhold but fails to do so can be held liable for the tax. Thus, if you do not withhold the 15 percent tax (10 percent tax in the case of dispositions described in § 1.1445-1(b)(2)) from the total that you pay on this transaction you could be required to pay the tax yourself, if what you are acquiring is a U.S. real property interest and the transferor is a foreign person. Tax that is withheld must be promptly paid over to the IRS using Form 8288. For further information see sections 897 and 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code and the related regulations.”
(2)
Notice to be filed with IRS.
An agent who is required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section to provide notice to a transferee, entity, or fiduciary must furnish a copy of that notice to the Internal Revenue Service by the date on which the notice is required to be given to the transferee, entity, or fiduciary. The copy of the notice must be delivered to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10) and must be accompanied by a cover letter stating that the copy is being filed pursuant to the requirements of this § 1.1445-4(c)(2).
(d)
Effect on recipient.
A transferee, entity, or fiduciary that receives a notice pursuant to this section prior to the date of the transfer from any agent of the transferor or transferee may not rely upon the subject certification or statement for purposes of excusing withholding pursuant to § 1.1445-2 or § 1.1445-5. Therefore, the recipient of a notice may be held liable for any failure to deduct and withhold tax under section 1445 as if such certification or statement had never been given. For special rules concerning the effect of the receipt of a notice after the date of the transfer, see §§ 1.1445-2(b)(4)(iv) and 1.1445-5 (c), (d) and (e).
(e)
Failure to provide notice.
Any agent who is required to provide notice but who fails to do so in the manner required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be held liable for the tax that the recipient of the notice would have been required to withhold under section 1445 if such notice had been given. However, an agent's liability under this paragraph (e) is limited to the amount of compensation that that agent derives from the transaction. In addition, an agent who assists in the preparation of, or fails to disclose knowledge of, a false certification or statement may be liable for civil or criminal penalties.
(f)
Definition of transferor's or transferee's agent
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the terms “transferor's agent” and “transferee's agent” means any person who represents the transferor or transferee (respectively)—
(i) In any negotiation with another person (or another person's agent) relating to the transaction; or
(ii) In settling the transaction.
(2)
Transactions subject to section 1445(e).
In the case of transactions subject section 1445(e), the following definitions apply.
(i) The term “transferor's agent” means any person that represents or advises an entity or fiduciary with respect to the planning, arrangement, or consummation by the entity of a transaction described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).
(ii) The term “transferee's agent” means any person that represents or advises the holder of an interest in an entity with respect to the planning, arrangement or consummation by the entity of a transaction described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).
(3)
Exclusion of settlement officers and clerical personnel.
For purposes of this section, a person shall not be treated as a transferor's agent or transferee's agent with respect to any transaction solely because such person performs one or more of the following activities.
(i) The receipt and disbursement of any portion of the consideration for the transaction;
(ii) The recording of any document in connection with the transaction;
(iii) Typing, copying, and other clerical tasks;
(iv) The obtaining of title insurance reports and reports concerning the condition of the real property that is the subject of the transaction; or
(v) The transmission or delivery of documents between the parties.
(4)
Exclusion for governing body of a condominium association and the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation.
The members of a board, committee or other governing body of a condominium association and the board of directors and officers of a cooperative housing corporation will not be deemed agents of the transferor or transferee if such individuals function exclusively in their capacity as representatives of such association or corporation with respect to the transaction. In addition, the managing agent of a cooperative housing corporation or condominium association will not be deemed to be an agent of the transferee or transferor if such person functions exclusively in its capacity as a managing agent. If a person's activities include advising the transferee or transferor with respect to the transfer, this exclusion shall not apply.
[T.D. 8113, 51 FR 46641, Dec. 24, 1986; 52 FR 3796, 3917, Feb. 6, 1987; T.D. 9082, 68 FR 46086, Aug. 5, 2003, as amended by T.D. 9751, 81 FR 8402, Feb. 19, 2016]
§ 1.1445-5
Special rules concerning distributions and other transactions by corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides special rules concerning the withholding that is required under section 1445(e) upon distributions and other transactions involving domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules that apply generally to the various withholding requirements set forth in this section. Under section 1445(e)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section, a domestic partnership or the fiduciary of a domestic trust or estate is required to withhold tax upon the entity's disposition of a U.S. real property interest if any foreign persons are partners or beneficiaries of the entity. Paragraph (d) provides rules concerning the requirement of section 1445(e)(2) that a foreign corporation withhold tax upon its distribution of a U.S. real property interest to its interest-holders. Finally, under section 1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e) of this section a domestic U.S. real property holding corporation is required to withhold tax upon certain distributions to interest-holders that are foreign persons. Paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section are reserved to provide rules concerning transactions involving interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates that will be subject to withholding pursuant to sections 1445(e) (4) and (5).
(b)
Rules of general application
—(1)
Double withholding not required.
If tax is required to be withheld with respect to a transfer of property in accordance with the rules of this section, then no additional tax is required to be withheld by the transferee of the property with respect to that transfer pursuant to the general rules of section 1445(a) and § 1.1445-1. For rules coordinating the withholding under section 1441 (or section 1442 or 1443) and under section 1445 on distributions from a corporation, see § 1.1441-3(b)(4). If a transfer of a U.S. real property interest described in section 1445(e) is exempt from withholding under the rules of this section, then no withholding is required under the general rules of section 1445(a) and § 1.1445-1.
(2)
Coordination with nonrecognition provisions
—(i)
In general.
Withholding shall not be required under the rules of this section with respect to a transfer described in section 1445(e) of a U.S. real property interest if—
(A) By reason of the operation of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the provisions of any treaty of the United States no gain or loss is required to be recognized by the foreign person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be required; and
(B) The entity or fiduciary that is otherwise required to withhold complies with the notice requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The entity or fiduciary must determine whether gain or loss is required to be recognized pursuant to the rules of section 897 and the applicable nonrecognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. An entity or fiduciary may obtain a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that confirms the applicability of a nonrecognition provision, but is not required to do so. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a
nonrecognition provision is any provision of the Internal Revenue Code for not recognizing gain or loss. If nonrecognition treatment is available only with respect to part of the gain realized on a transfer, the exemption from withholding provided by this paragraph (b)(2) shall not apply. In such cases a withholding certificate may be sought pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1445-6.
(ii)
Notice of nonrecognition transfer.
An entity or fiduciary that fails to withhold tax with respect to a transfer in reliance upon the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) must by the 20th day after the date of the transfer deliver a notice thereof to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). No particular form is required for a notice of transfer, but the following information must be set forth in paragraphs labelled to correspond with the letter set forth below:
(A) A statement that the document submitted constitutes a notice of a nonrecognition transfer pursuant to the requirements of § 1.1445-5(b)(2)(ii);
(B) The name, office address, and identifying number of the entity of fiduciary submitting the notice;
(C) The name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each foreign person with respect to which withholding would otherwise be required;
(D) A brief description of the transfer; and
(E) A brief statement of the law and facts supporting the claim that recognition of gain or loss is not required with respect to the transfer.
(3)
Interest-holder not a foreign person
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an entity or fiduciary is required to withhold with respect to certain transfers of property if a holder of an interest in the entity is a foreign person. For purposes of determining whether a holder of an interest is a foreign person, and entity or fiduciary may rely upon a certification of nonforeign status provided by that person in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, such a certification excuses the entity or fiduciary from any liability otherwise imposed pursuant to section 1445(e) and regulations thereunder. However, no obligation is imposed upon an entity or fiduciary to obtain certifications from interest-holders; an entity or fiduciary may instead rely upon other means to ascertain the nonforeign status of an interest-holder. If the entity or fiduciary does rely upon other means but the interest-holder proves, in fact, to be a foreign person, then the entity or fiduciary is subject to any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and regulations thereunder.
An entity or fiduciary is not required to rely upon other means to ascertain the non-foreign status of an interest-holder and may demand a certification of non-foreign status. If the certification is not provided, the entity or fiduciary may withhold tax under section 1445 and will be considered, for purposes of sections 1461 through 1463, to have been required to withhold such tax.
(ii)
Interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, an entity or fiduciary may treat any holder of an interest in the entity as a U.S. person if that interest-holder furnishes to the entity or fiduciary a certification stating that the interest-holder is not a foreign person, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. In general, a foreign person is a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate, except that a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) is not a foreign person for purposes of this section.
(B)
Procedural rules.
The rules in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) apply for purposes of the interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status (including a certification of non-foreign status provided by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)).
(
1
) An interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status must be signed under penalties of perjury and must state—
(
i
) That the interest-holder is not a foreign person; and
(
ii
) The interest-holder's name, identifying number, home address (in the case of an individual), or office address
(in the case of an entity), and place of incorporation (in the case of a corporation).
(
2
) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, an individual's identifying number is the individual's Social Security number and any other person's identifying number is its U.S. employer identification number (see § 1.897-1(p)), or, if the interest-holder is a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) that does not have a U.S. taxpayer identification number, a foreign tax identification number issued by its jurisdiction of residence. The certification must be signed by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a general partner in the case of a partnership, and by a trustee, executor, or equivalent fiduciary in the case of a trust or estate. No particular form is needed for a certification pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), nor is any particular language required, so long as the document meets the requirements of this paragraph, except that, with respect to certification submitted by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)), the transferor must state on the certification that it is treated as a non-foreign person because it is a withholding qualified holder and must further specify whether it qualifies as a withholding qualified holder because it is a qualified holder under § 1.897(l)-1(d) or a foreign partnership that satisfies the requirements of § 1.1445-1(g)(11). Samples of acceptable certifications are provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(E) of this section.
(
3
) An entity may rely upon a certification pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) for a period of two calendar years following the close of the calendar year in which the certification was given. If an interest holder becomes a foreign person (or no longer is treated as a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and therefore is no longer treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of withholding under section 1445 within the period described in the preceding sentence, the interest-holder must notify the entity before any further dispositions or distributions and upon receipt of such notice (or any other notification of the foreign status of the interest-holder) the entity may no longer rely upon the prior certification. An entity that obtains and relies upon a certification must retain that certification with its books and records for a period of three calendar years following the close of the last calendar year in which the entity relied upon the certification.
(C)
Foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i).
A foreign corporation that has made a valid election under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 897 may provide a certification of non-foreign status pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). However, an electing foreign corporation must attach to such certification a copy of the acknowledgment of the election provided to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 1.897-3(d)(4).
An acknowledgment is valid for this purpose only if it states that the information required by § 1.897-3 has been determined to be complete.
(D)
Form W-8EXP.
A certification of non-foreign status can be made by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) as provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) to certify its qualified holder status. A certification of non-foreign status under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) also includes a certification made on a Form W-8EXP that states that the interest-holder is treated as a non-foreign person because it is a withholding qualified holder and must further specify whether it qualifies as a withholding qualified holder because it is a qualified holder under § 1.897(l)-1(d) or a foreign partnership that satisfies the requirements of § 1.1445-1(g)(11). The certification must also meet all of the other requirements for a valid Form W-8EXP as provided on the form and the instructions to the form. A qualified holder may not provide a certification of non-foreign status on a Form W-9, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Reliance upon certification not permitted.
An entity or fiduciary may not rely upon an interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status if, prior to or at the time of the transfer with respect to which withholding would be
required, the entity or fiduciary either—
(A) Has actual knowledge that the certification is false;
(B) Has received a notice that the certification is false from a transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to § 1.1445-4; or
(C) Has received from a corporation that it knows to be a foreign corporation a certification that does not have attached to it a copy of the IRS acknowledgment of the corporation's election under section 897(i), as required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. Such an entity's or fiduciary's withholding obligations shall apply as if a statement had never been given, and such an entity or fiduciary may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold. For special rules concerning an entity's belated receipt of a notice concerning a false certification, see paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iv)
Form W-9.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, a certification of non-foreign status includes a valid Form W-9,
Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,
or its successor, submitted to the transferee by the transferor.
(4)
Property transferred not a U.S. real property interest
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an entity or fiduciary is required to withhold with respect to certain transfers of property, if the property transferred is a U.S. real property interest. (In addition, taxable distributions of U.S. real property interests by domestic or foreign partnerships, trusts, and estates will be subject to withholding pursuant to section 1445(e)(4) and paragraph (f) of this section after publication of a Treasury decision under sections 897 (e)(2) and (g). As defined in section 897(c) and § 1.897-1(c), a U.S. real property interest includes certain interests in U.S. corporations, as well as direct interests in real property and certain associated personal property. This paragraph (b)(4) provides rules pursuant to which an entity (or fiduciary thereof) that transfers an interest in a U.S. corporation may determine that withholding is not required because the interest transferred is not a U.S. real property interest. To determine whether an interest in tangible property constitutes a U.S. real property interest the transfer of which would be subject to withholding, see § 1.897-1 (b) and (c).
(ii)
Interests in publicly traded entities.
Withholding is not required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon an entity's transfer of an interest in a domestic corporation if any class of stock of the corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market. This exemption shall apply to a disposition incident to an initial public offering of stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Similarly, no withholding is required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon an entity's transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership or trust. However, the rule of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) shall not apply to the transfer, to a single transferee (or related transferees as defined in § 1.897-1(i)) in a single transaction (or related transactions), of an interest described in § 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii)(B) (relating to substantial amounts of non-publicly traded interests in publicly traded corporations) or of similar interests in publicly traded partnerships or trusts. The entity making a transfer described in the preceding sentence must otherwise determine whether withholding is required, pursuant to section 1445(e) and the regulations thereunder. Transactions shall be deemed to be related if they are undertaken within 90 days of one another or if it can otherwise be shown that they were undertaken in pursuance of a prearranged plan.
(iii)
Corporation's statement that interest is not a U.S. real property interest.
(A)
In general.
No withholding is required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section upon an entity's transfer of an interest in a domestic corporation if, prior to the transfer, the entity or fiduciary obtains a statement, issued by the corporation pursuant to § 1.897-2(h), certifying that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest. In general, a corporation may issue such a statement only if the corporation was not a U.S. real property holding corporation at any time during the previous five years (or the period in which the interest was held by its present holder, if
shorter) or if interests in the corporation ceased to be United States real property interests under section 897(c)(1)(B). (A corporation may not provide such a statement based on its determination that the interest in question is an interest solely as a creditor.) See § 1.897-2 (f) and (h). A corporation's statement may be relied upon for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) only if the statement is dated not more than 30 days prior to the date of the transfer.
(B)
Reliance on statement not permitted.
An entity or fiduciary is not entitled to rely upon a statement that an interest in a corporation is not a U.S. real property interest, if, prior to or at the time of the transfer, the entity or fiduciary either—
(
1
) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or
(
2
) Receives a notice that the statement is false from a transferor's or transferee's agent, pursuant to § 1.1445-4.
Such an entity's or fiduciary's withholding obligations shall apply as if a statement had never been given, and such an entity or fiduciary may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold. For special rules concerning an entity's belated receipt of a notice concerning a false statement, see paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(5)
Reporting and paying over of withheld amounts
—(i)
In General.
An entity or fiduciary must report and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service any tax withheld pursuant to section 1445(e) and this section by the 20th day after the date of the transfer (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(8). Forms 8288 and 8288-A are used for this purpose and must be filed at the location as provided in the instructions to Forms 8288 and 8288-A. The contents of Forms 8288 and 8288-A are described in § 1.1445-1(d). Pursuant to section 7502 and regulations thereunder, the timely mailing of Forms 8288 and 8288-A by U.S. mail will be treated as their timely filing. Form 8288-A will be stamped by the Internal Revenue Service to show receipt, and a stamped copy will be mailed by the Service to the interest holder if the Form 8288 is complete, including the transferor's identifying number, at the address shown on the form, for the interest-holder's use. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section. If an application for a withholding certificate with respect to a transfer of a U.S. real property interest was submitted to the Internal Revenue Service on the day of or at any time prior to the transfer, the entity or fiduciary must withhold the amount required under section 1445(e) and the rules of this section. However, the amount withheld, or a lesser amount as determined by the Service, need not be reported and paid over to the Service until the 20th day following the Service's final determination. For this purpose, the Service's final determination occurs on the day when the withholding certificate is mailed to the applicant by the Service or when a notification denying the request for a withholding certificate is mailed to the applicant by the Service. An application is submitted to the Service on the day it is actually received by the Service at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10) or, under the rules of section 7502, on the day it is mailed to the Service at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). For rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates, see § 1.1445-6.
(ii)
Anti-abuse rule.
An entity or fiduciary that in reliance upon the rules of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii) fails to report and pay over amounts withheld by the 20th day following the date of the transfer, shall be subject to the payment of interest and penalties if the relevant application for a withholding certificate (or an amendment of the application for a withholding certificate) was submitted for a principle purpose of delaying the payment to the IRS of the amount withheld. Interest and penalties shall be assessed on the amount that is ultimately paid over, with respect to the period between the 20th day after the date of the transfer and the date on which payment is made.
(6)
Liability upon failure to withhold.
For rules regarding liability upon failure to withhold under section 1445(e) and this § 1.1445-5, see § 1.1445-1(e).
(7)
Effect of withholding by entity or fiduciary upon interest holder.
The withholding of tax under section 1445(e) does not excuse a foreign person that is subject to U.S. tax by reason of the operation of section 897 from filing a U.S.
tax return. Thus, Form 1040NR. 1041. or 1120F, as appropriate must be filed and any tax due must be paid, by the filing date otherwise applicable to such person (or any extension thereof). The tax withheld with respect to the foreign person under section 1445(e) (as shown on Form 8288-A) shall be credited against the amount of income tax as computed in such return, but only if the stamped copy of Form 8288-A provided to the entity or fiduciary (under paragraph (b)(5) of this section) is attached to the return or substantial evidence of the amount of tax withheld is attached to the return in accordance with the succeeding sentence. If a stamped copy of Form 8288-A has not been provided to the interest-holder by the Service, the interest-holder may establish the amount of tax withheld by the entity or fiduciary by attaching to its return substantial evidence of such amount. Such an interest-holder must attach to its return a statement which supplies all of the information required by § 1.1445-1(d)(2). If the amount withheld under section 1445(e) constitutes less than the full amount of the foreign person's U.S. tax liability for that taxable year, then a payment of estimated tax may be required to be made pursuant to section 6154 or 6654 prior to the filing of the income tax return for the year. Alternatively, if the amount withheld under section 1445(e) exceeds the foreign person's maximum tax liability with respect to the transaction (
as reflected
in a withholding certificate issued by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 1.1445-6), then the foreign person may seek an early refund of the excess pursuant to § 1.1445-6(g). A foreign person that takes gain into account in accordance with the provisions of section 453 shall not be entitled to a refund to the amount withheld, unless a withholding certificate providing for such a refund is obtained pursuant to § 1.1445-6. If an entity or fiduciary withholds tax under section 1445(e) with respect to a beneficial owner of an interest who is not a foreign person, such beneficial owner may credit the amount of any tax withheld against his income tax liability in accordance with the provisions of this § 1.1445-5(b)(7) or apply for an early refund under § 1.1445-6(g).
(8)
Effective dates
—(i)
Partnership, trust, and estate dispositions of U.S. real property interests.
The provisions of section 1445(e)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section, requiring withholding upon certain dispositions of U.S. real property interests by domestic partnerships, trusts, and estates, shall apply to any disposition on or after January 1, 1985.
(ii)
Certain distributions by foreign corporations.
The provisions of section 1445(e)(2) and paragraph (d) of this section, requiring withholding upon distributions of U.S. real property interests by foreign corporations shall apply to distributions made on or after January 1, 1985.
(iii)
Distributions by certain domestic corporations to foreign shareholders.
The provisions of section 1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section, requiring withholding upon distributions in redemption of stock under section 302(a) or liquidating distributions under Part II of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code by U.S. real property holding corporations to foreign shareholders, shall apply to distributions made on or after January 1, 1985. The provisions of section 1445(e)(3) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section requiring withholding on distributions under section 301 by U.S. real property holding corporations to foreign shareholders shall apply to distributions made after August 20, 1996. The provisions of paragraph (e) of this section providing for the coordination of withholding between sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443) for distributions under section 301 by U.S. real property holding corporations to foreign shareholders apply to distributions after December 31, 2000 (see § 1.1441-3(c)(4) and (h)).
(iv)
Taxable distributions by domestic or foreign partnerships, trusts, and estates.
The provisions of section 1445(e)(4), requiring withholding upon certain taxable distributions by domestic or foreign partnerships, trusts, and estates, shall apply to distributions made on or after the effective date of a Treasury decision under section 897 (e)(2)(B)(ii) and (g).
(v) [Reserved]
(vi)
Tiered Partnerships.
No withholding is required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by a partnership which is directly owned, in whole or in part, by another domestic partnership (but only to the extent that the amount realized is attributable to the partnership interest of that other partnership) until the effective date of a Treasury Decision published under section 1445(e) providing rules governing this matter.
(c)
Dispositions of U.S. real property interests by domestic partnerships, trusts, and estates
—(1)
Withholding required
—(i)
In general.
If a domestic partnership, trust, or estate disposes of a U.S. real property interest and any partner, beneficiary, or owner of the entity is a foreign person, then the partnership or the trustee, executor, or equivalent fiduciary of the trust or estate must withhold tax with respect to each such foreign person in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv), of this paragraph (c)(1) (as applicable). The withholding obligation imposed by this paragraph (c) applies to the fiduciary of a trust even if the grantor of the trust or another person is treated as the owner of the trust or any portion thereof for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, the withholding obligation imposed by this paragraph (c) applies to the trustee of a land trust or similar arrangement, even if such a trustee is not ordinarily treated under the applicable provisions of local law as a true fiduciary.
(ii)
Disposition by partnership.
A partnership must withhold a tax equal to the rate specified in section 1445(e)(1) multiplied by the amount of each foreign partner's distributive share of the gain realized by the partnership upon the disposition of each U.S. real property interest. Such distributive share of the gain must be determined pursuant to the principles of section 704 and the regulations thereunder. For the rules applicable to partnerships, interests in which are regularly traded on an established securities market, see § 1.1445-8.
(iii)
Disposition by trust or estate
—(A)
In general.
A trustee, fiduciary, executor or equivalent fiduciary (hereafter collectively referred to as the fiduciary) of a trust or estate having one or more foreign beneficiaries must withhold tax in accordance with the rules of this § 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii). Such a fiduciary must establish a U.S. real property interest account and must enter in such account all gains and losses realized during the taxable year of the trust or estate from dispositions of U.S. real property interests. The fiduciary must withhold a tax equal to the rate specified in section 1445(e)(1) multiplied by the amount of any distribution to a foreign beneficiary that is attributable to the balance in the U.S. real property interest account on the day of the distribution. A distribution from a trust or estate to a beneficiary (domestic or foreign) shall, solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1), be deemed to be attributable first to any balance in the U.S. real property interest account and then to other amounts. However, a distribution that occurs prior to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest in a taxable year or at any other time when the amount contained in the U.S. real property interest account is zero, is not subject to withholding under this § 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iii). The U.S. real property interest account is reduced by the amount distributed to all beneficiaries (domestic and foreign) attributable to such account during the taxable year of the trust or estate. Any ending balance of the U.S. real property interest account not distributed by the close of the taxable year of the trust or estate is cancelled and is not carried over (or carried back) to any other year. Thus, the beginning balance of such account in any taxable year of the trust or estate is always zero. For rules applicable to grantor trusts see § 1.1445-5(c)(1)(iv). For rules applicable to trusts, interests in which are regularly traded on an established securities market and real estate investment trusts, see § 1.1445-8.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. In 1994, the relevant rate of withholding (that is, the rate specified in section 1445(e)(1)) was 35%.
On January 1, 1994, A establishes a domestic trust (which has as its taxable year, the calendar year) for the benefit of B, a nonresident alien, and C, a U.S. citizen. The
trust is not a trust subject to sections 671 through 679. Under the terms of the trust, the trustee, T, is given discretion to distribute income and corpus of the trust to provide for the reasonable needs of B and C. During the trust's 1994 tax year, T disposes of three parcels of vacant land located in the United States. The following chart illustrates the computation of the amount subject to withholding under section 1445 with respect to distributions made by T to B and C during 1994.

Disposition by grantor trust.
The trustee or equivalent fiduciary of a trust that is subject to the provisions of subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J (sections 671 through 679) must withhold a tax equal to the rate specified in section 1445(e)(1) multiplied by the amount of the gain realized from each disposition of a U.S. real property interest to the extent such gain is allocable to a portion of the trust treated as owned by a foreign person under subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J.
(2)
Withholding not required under paragraph (c)
—(i) [Reserved]
(ii)
Interest-holder not a foreign person
—(A)
In general.
A domestic partnership, trust, or estate that disposes of a U.S. real property interest shall not be required to withhold with respect to any partner or beneficiary that it determines, pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, not to be a foreign person.
(B)
Belated notice of false certification.
If after the date of the transfer a partnership or fiduciary learns that a partner's or beneficiary's certification of non-foreign status is false, then that partnership or fiduciary shall be required to withhold, with respect to the foreign partner or beneficiary that gave the false certification, the lessor of—
(
1
) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under the rules of this paragraph (c), or
(
2
) An amount equal to that partner's or beneficiary's remaining interests in the income or assets of the partnership, trust, or estate. Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 60th day following the date on which the partnership or fiduciary learns that the certification is false. For rules concerning the notifications of false certifications that may be required to be given to partnerships and fiduciaries, see § 1.1445-4(b).
(iii)
Property disposed of not a U.S. real property interest
—(A)
In general.
No withholding is required under this paragraph (c) if a domestic partnership, trust, or estate that disposes of property determines pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section that the property disposed of is not a U.S. real property interest.
(B)
Belated notice of false statement.
If after the date of the transfer a partnership or fiduciary learns that a corporation's statement (that an interest in the corporation is not a U.S. real property interest) is false, then that partnership or fiduciary shall be required to withhold, with respect to each foreign partner or beneficiary, the lesser of—
(
1
) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under the rules of this paragraph (c), or
(
2
) An amount equal to that partner's or beneficiary's remaining interests in the income or assets of the partnership, trust, or estate.
Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 60th day following the date on which the partnership or fiduciary learns that the statement is false. For rules concerning the notifications of false statements that may be required to be given to partnerships or fiduciaries, see § 1.1445-4(b).
(iv)
Withholding certificate.
No withholding is required under this paragraph (c) with respect to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest if the Internal Revenue Service issues a withholding certificate that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates, see § 1.1445-6.
(v)
Nonrecognition transactions.
For special rules concerning transactions entitled to nonrecognition of gain or loss, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(3)
Large partnerships or trusts
—(i)
In general.
If a partnership or trust has more than 100 partners or beneficiaries, then the partnership or fiduciary of the trust may elect to withhold in accordance with the provisions of this § 1.1445-5(c)(3) in lieu of withholding in the manner required by § 1.1445-5(c)(1). However, the rules of this § 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall not apply to any partnership or trust interests in which are regularly traded on an established securities market except as described in § 1.1445-8(c)(1). The rules of this § 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall not apply to any real estate investment trust. See § 1445-8.
(ii)
Amount to be withheld.
A partnership or trust electing to withhold under this paragraph (c)(3) shall withhold from each distribution to a foreign person an amount equal to the rate specified in section 1445(e)(1) multiplied by of the amount attributable to section 1445(e)(1) transfers.
(iii)
Amounts attributable to section 1445(e)(1) transfers.
A distribution is attributable to section 1445(e)(1) transfers to the extent of the partner's or beneficiary's proportionate share of the current balance of the entity's section 1445(e)(1) account. A distribution from a partnership or trust that has made an election under this § 1.1445-5(c)(3) shall be deemed first to be attributable to a section 1445(e)(1) transfer to the extent of the balance in the section 1445(e)(1) account. An entity's section 1445(e)(1) account shall be equal to—
(A) The total amount of net gain realized by the entity upon all transfers of U.S. real property interests carried out by the entity after the date of its election under this § 1.1445-5(c)(3); minus
(B) The total amount of all distributions by the entity to domestic and foreign distributees from such account.
(iv)
Special rules for entities that make recurring sales of growing crops and timber.
An entity that makes an election under § 1.1445-5(c)(3) and that makes recurring sales of growing crops and timber may further elect to determine the amount subject to withholding under the rules of this § 1.1445-5(c)(3)(iv). Such an entity must withhold from each distribution to a foreign partner or beneficiary an amount equal to 15 percent of such partner's or beneficiary's proportionate share of the current balance of the entity's gross section 1445(e)(1) account. An entity's gross section 1445(e)(1) account equals—
(A) The total amount realized by the entity upon all transfers of U.S. real property interests carried out by the entity after the date of its election under this § 1.1445-5(c)(3)(iv); minus
(B) The total amount of all distributions to domestic and foreign distributees from such account.
An entity that elects to compute the amount subject to withholding under this § 1.1445-5(c)(3)(iv), shall make such election in accordance with § 1.1445-5(c)(3)(vi) and shall be subject to the provisions otherwise applicable under § 1.1445-5(c)(3).
(v)
Procedural rules.
An election under paragraph (c)(3) may be made by filing a notice thereof with at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). The notice must be submitted by a general partner (in the case of a partnership) or the trustee or equivalent fiduciary (in the case of a trust). The notice must set forth the name, office address, and identifying number of the partnership or fiduciary making the election, and, in the case of a partnership, must include the name, office address, and identifying number of the general partner submitting the election. An election under this paragraph (c)(3) may be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service. Consent of the Service may be requested by filing an application to revoke the election at the address stated above. This application must include all information provided to the Service with the election notice and must provide an explanation of the reasons for revoking the
election. The application to revoke an election must also specify the amount remaining to be distributed in the section 1445(e)(1) account or the gross section 1445(e)(1) account.
An entity that ceases to qualify under section 1.1445-5(c)(3) because such entity does not have more than 100 partners or beneficiaries may revoke its election only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service.
(d)
Distributions of U.S. real property interests by foreign corporations
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation that distributes a U.S. real property interest must deduct and withhold a tax equal to the rate specified in section 1445(e)(2) multiplied by of the amount of gain recognized by the corporation on the distribution. The amount of gain required to be recognized by the corporation must be determined pursuant to the rules of section 897 and any other applicable section. For special rules concerning the applicability of a nonrecognition provision to a distribution, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The withholding liability imposed by this paragraph (d) applies to the same taxpayer that owes the related substantive income tax liability pursuant to the operation of section 897. Only one such liability will be assessed and collected from a foreign corporation, but separate penalties for failures to comply with the two requirements will be asserted.
(2)
Withholding not required
—(i)
Property distributed not a U.S. real property interest
—(A)
In general.
No withholding is required under this paragraph (d) if a foreign corporation that distributes property determines pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section that the property distributed is not a U.S. real property interest.
(B)
Belated notice of false statement.
If after the date of a distribution described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section a foreign corporation learns that another corporation's statement (that an interest in that other corporation is not a U.S. real property interest) is false, then the foreign corporation may not rely upon that statement for any purpose. Such a foreign corporation's withholding obligations under this paragraph (d) shall apply if a statement had never been given, and such a corporation may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(5) for any failure to withhold. Amounts withheld pursuant to the rule of this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) must be reported and paid over by the 60th day following the date on which the foreign corporation learns that the statement is false. No penalties or interest will be assessed for failures to withhold prior to that date. For rules concerning the notifications of false statements that may be required to be given to foreign corporations, see § 1.1445-4(b).
(ii)
Withholding certificate.
No withholding is required under this paragraph (d) with respect to a foreign corporation's distribution of a U.S. real property interest if the distributing corporation obtains a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates, see § 1.1445-6.
(e)
Distributions to foreign persons by U.S. real property holding corporations
—(1)
In general.
A domestic corporation that distributes any property to a foreign person that holds an interest in the corporation must deduct and withhold a tax equal to 15 percent of the fair market value of the property distributed to the foreign person, if—
(i) The foreign person's interest in the corporation constitutes a U.S. real property interest under the provisions of section 897 and regulations thereunder; and
(ii) There is a distribution of property in redemption of stock treated as an exchange under section 302(a), in liquidation of the corporation pursuant to the provisions of Part II of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 331 through section 346), or with respect to stock under section 301 that is not made out of earnings and profits of the corporation.
(2)
Coordination rules for Section 301 distributions.
If a domestic corporation makes a distribution of property under section 301 to a foreign person whose interest in such corporation constitutes a U.S. real property interest under the provisions of section 897 and the regulations thereunder, then see § 1.1441-3(c)(4) for rules coordinating withholding obligations under sections 1445 and 1441 (or 1442 or 1443)).
(3)
Withholding not required
—(i)
Foreign person's interest not a U.S. real property interest.
Withholding is required under this paragraph (e) only with respect to distributions to foreign persons holding interests in the corporation that constitute U.S. real property interests. In general, a foreign person's interest in a domestic corporation constitutes a U.S. real property interest if the corporation was a U.S real property holding corporation at any time during the shorter of (A) the period in which the foreign person held the interest or (B) the previous five years (but not earlier than June 19, 1980). See section 897(c) and §§ 1.897-1(c) and 1.897-2 (b) and (h). However, an interest in such a corporation ceases to be a U.S. real property interest after all of the U.S. real property interests held by the corporation itself are disposed of in transactions on which gain or loss is recognized. See section 897(c)(1)(B) and § 1.897-2(f)(2). Thus, if a U.S. real property holding corporation in the process of liquidation does not elect section 337 nonrecognition treatment upon its sale of all U.S. real property interests held by the corporation, and recognizes gain or loss upon such sales, interests in that corporation cease to be U.S. real property interests. Therefore, no withholding would be required with respect to that corporation's subsequent liquidating distribution to a foreign shareholder of property other than a U.S. real property interest.
(ii)
Nonrecognition transactions.
For special rules concerning the applicability of a nonrecognition provision to a distribution described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Interest-holder not a foreign person
—(A)
In general.
A domestic corporation shall not be required to withhold under this paragraph (e) with respect to a distribution of property to any distributee that it determines, pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, not to be a foreign person.
(B)
Belated notice of false certification.
If after the date of a distribution described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section a domestic corporation learns that an interest-holder's certification of non-foreign status is false, then the corporation may rely upon that certification only if the person providing the false certification holds (or held) less than 10 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation. With respect to less than 10 percent interest-holders, no withholding is required under this paragraph (e) upon receipt of a belated notice of false certification. With respect to 10 percent or greater interest-holders, the corporation's withholding obligations under this paragraph (e) shall apply as if a certification had never been given, and such a corporation may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(6) for any failure to withhold as of the date specified in this § 1.1445-5(e)(3)(iii)(B). Amounts withheld pursuant to the rule of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) must be reported and paid over by the 60th day following the date on which the corporation learns that the certification is false. No penalties or interest for failures to withhold will be assessed prior to that date. For rules concerning the notifications of false certifications that may be required to be given to U.S. real property holding corporations, see § 1.1445-4(b).
(iv)
Withholding certificate.
No withholding, or reduced withholding, is required under this paragraph (e) with respect to a domestic corporation's distribution of property if the distributing corporation obtains a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that so provides. For rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates, see § 1.1445-6.
(f)
Taxable distributions by domestic or foreign partnerships, trusts, or estates.
[Reserved]
(g)
Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates.
[Reserved]
(h)
Applicability dates.
The requirement in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring after November 3, 2003. The withholding rates set forth in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (e)(1) of this section apply to distributions after February 16, 2016. For distributions on or before February 16, 2016, see paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (e)(1) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2015. Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section applies
to certifications provided on or after May 7, 2019, except that a taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section with respect to certifications provided before May 7, 2019. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to distributions on or after November 30, 2020. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section applies with respect to dispositions of U.S. real property interests and distributions described in section 897(h) occurring on or after December 29, 2022. For dispositions of U.S. real property interests and distributions described in section 897(h) occurring before December 29, 2022, see § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii)(A), as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2021.

§ 1.1445-6
Adjustments pursuant to withholding certificate of amount required to be withheld under section 1445(e).
(a)
Withholding certificate for purposes of section 1445(e)
—(1)
In general.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1445-5 (c)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(ii), and (e)(2)(iv), withholding under section 1445(e) may be reduced or eliminated pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the rules of this § 1.1445-6. A withholding certificate may be issued in cases where adjusted withholding is appropriate (e.g., because of the applicability of a nonrecognition provision—see paragraph (c) of this section), where the relevant taxpayers are exempt from U.S. tax (see paragraph (d) of this section), or where an agreement for the payment of tax is entered into with the Service (see paragraph (e) of this section). A withholding certificate that is obtained prior to a transfer allows the entity or fiduciary to withhold a reduced amount or excuses withholding entirely. A withholding certificate that is obtained after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or an early refund pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. The Internal Revenue Service will act upon an application for a withholding certificate not later than the 90th day after it is received. (The Service may deny a request for a withholding certificate where, after due notice, an applicant fails to provide the information necessary to make a determination.) Solely for this purpose (i.e., determining the day upon which the 90 day period commences), an application is received by the Service on the date when all information necessary for the Service to make a determination is provided by the applicant. In no event, however, will a withholding certificate be issued without the transferor's identifying number. (For rules regarding whether an application has been timely submitted, see § 1.1445-5(b)(5)). The Internal Revenue Service will act upon an application for an early refund not later than the 90th day after it is received. An application for an early refund must either (i) include a copy of a withholding certificate issued by the Service with respect to the transaction, or (ii) be combined with an application for a withholding certificate. Where an application for an early refund is combined with an application for a withholding certificate, the Service will act upon both applications not later than the 90th day after receipt. Either an entity, a fiduciary, or a relevant taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) may apply for a withholding certificate. An entity or fiduciary may apply for a withholding certificate with respect to all or less than all relevant taxpayers. For special rules concerning the issuance of a withholding certificate to a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i), see § 1.1445-7(d).
(2)
Relevant taxpayer.
For purposes of this section, the term “relevant taxpayer” means any foreign person that will bear substantive income tax liability by reason of the operation of section 897 with respect to a transaction upon which withholding is required under section 1445(e).
(b)
Applications for withholding certificates
—(1)
In general.
An application for a withholding certificate pursuant to this § 1.1445-6 must be submitted in the manner provided in § 1.1445-3 (b). However, in lieu of the information required to be submitted pursuant to
§ 1.1445-3(b)(4), the applicant must provide the information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the information required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be submitted with the application.
(2)
Basis for certificate
—(i)
Adjusted withholding.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of a claim that adjusted withholding is appropriate, the application must include a calculation, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, of the maximum tax that may be imposed on each relevant taxpayer with respect to which adjusted withholding is sought. The application must also include all evidence necessary to substantiate the claimed calculation, such as records of adjustments to basis or appraisals of fair market value.
(ii)
Exemption.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of a relevant taxpayer's exemption from U.S. tax, the application must set forth a brief statement of the law and facts that support the claimed exemption. See paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii)
Agreement.
If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis of an agreement for the payment of tax, the application must include a copy of the agreement proposed by the applicant and a copy of the security instrument (if any) proposed by the applicant. In this regard, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Relevant taxpayers.
An application for withholding certificate pursuant to this section must include all of the following information: the name, identifying number, and home address (in the case of an individual) or office address (in the case of an entity) of each relevant taxpayer with respect to which adjusted withholding is sought.
(c)
Adjustment of amount required to be withheld.
The Internal Revenue Service may issue a withhold certificate that excuses withholding or that permits an entity or fiduciary to withhold an adjusted amount reflecting the relevant taxpayers' maximum tax liability. A relevant taxpayer's maximum tax liability is the maximum amount which that taxpayer could be required to pay as tax by reason of the transaction upon which withholding is required. In the case of an individual taxpayer that amount will generally be the gain realized by the individual, multiplied by the maximum individual income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. In the case of a corporate taxpayer, that amount will generally be the gain realized by the corporation, multiplied by the maximum corporate income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. However, that amount must be adjusted to take into account the following:
(1) Any reduction of tax to which the relevant taxpayer is entitled under the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty;
(2) The effect of any nonrecognition provision that is applicable to the transaction;
(3) Any losses previously realized and recognized by the relevant taxpayer during the taxable year by reason of the operation of section 897;
(4) Any amount realized upon the subject transfer by the relevant taxpayer that is required to be treated as ordinary income under any provision of the Code; and
(5) Any other factor that may increase or reduce the tax upon the transaction.
(d)
Relevant taxpayer's exemption from U.S. tax
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses withholding by an entity or fiduciary if it is established that a relevant taxpayer's income from the transaction will be exempt from U.S. tax. For the available exemptions, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If a relevant taxpayer is entitled to a reduction of (rather than an exemption from) U.S. tax, then the entity or fiduciary may obtain a withholding certificate to that effect pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Available exemptions.
A relevant taxpayer's income from a transaction with respect to which withholding is required under section 1445(e) may be exempt from U.S. tax because either:
(i) The relevant taxpayer is an integral part or controlled entity of a foreign government and the subject income is exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 892 and the regulations thereunder; or
(ii) The relevant taxpayer is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty
that provides for such an exemption (subject to the limitations imposed by section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 96-499, which, in general overrides such benefits as of January 1, 1985).
(e)
Agreement for the payment of tax
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses withholding or that permits an entity or fiduciary to withhold a reduced amount, if the entity, fiduciary, or a relevant taxpayer enters into an agreement for the payment of tax pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e). An agreement for the payment of tax is a contract between the Service and the entity, fiduciary, or relevant taxpayer that consists of two necessary elements. Those elements are—
(i) A contract between the Service and the other person, setting forth in detail the rights and obligations of each; and
(ii) A security instrument or other form of security acceptable to the Assistant Commissioner (International).
(2)
Contents of agreement
—(i)
In general.
An agreement for the payment of tax must cover an amount described in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (e)(2). The agreement may either provide adequate security for the payment of the chosen amount with respect to the relevant taxpayer in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section or provide for the payment of that amount through a combination of security and withholding of tax by the entity or fiduciary.
(ii)
Tax that would otherwise be withheld.
An agreement for the payment of tax may cover the amount of tax that would otherwise be required to be withheld with respect to the relevant taxpayer pursuant to section 1445(e). In addition to the amount computed pursuant to section 1445(e), the applicant must agree to pay interest upon that amount, at the rate established under section 6621, with respect to the period between the date on which withholding tax under section 1445(e) would otherwise be due and the date on which the relevant taxpayer's payment of tax with respect to the disposition will be due. The amount of interest agreed upon must be paid by the applicant regardless of whether or not the Service is required to draw upon any security provided pursuant to the agreement. The interest may be paid either with the return or by the Service drawing upon the security.
(iii)
Maximum tax liability.
An agreement for the payment of tax may cover the relevant taxpayer's maximum tax liability, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must also provide for the payment of an additional amount equal to 25 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This additional amount secures the interest and penalties that would accrue between the date of the relevant taxpayer's failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the disposition, and the date of which the Service collects upon that liability pursuant to the agreement.
(iv)
Allocation of payment.
An agreement for the payment of tax pursuant to this section must set forth an allocation of the payment provided for by the agreement among the relevant taxpayers with respect to which the withholding certificate is sought. In the case of an agreement that covers an amount described in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (e)(2), such allocation must be based upon the amount that would otherwise be required to be withheld with respect to each relevant taxpayer. In the case of an agreement that covers an amount described in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (e)(2), such allocation must be based upon each relevant taxpayer's maximum tax liability.
(3)
Major types of security.
The major types of security that are acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section are described in § 1.1445-3(e)(3).
(4)
Terms of security instrument.
Any security instrument that is furnished pursuant to this section must contain the terms described in § 1.1445-3(e)(4).
(f)
Amendments to application for withholding certificates
—(1)
In general.
An applicant for a withholding certificate may amend an otherwise complete application by submitting an amending statement to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). The amending statement shall provide the information required by § 1.1445-6(f)(3) and must be
signed and accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement in accordance with § 1.1445-6(b).
(2)
Extension of time for the Service to process requests for withholding certificates
—(i)
In general.
If an amending statement is submitted, the time in which the Internal Revenue Service must act upon the amended application shall be extended by 30 days.
(ii)
Substantial amendments.
If an amending statement is submitted and the Service finds that the statement substantially amends to the facts of the underlying application or substantially alters the terms of the withholding certificate as requested in the initial application, the time within which the Service must act upon the amended application shall be extended by 60 days. The applicant shall be so notified.
(iii)
Amending statement received after the requested withholding certificate has been signed on behalf of the Service.
If an amending statement is received after the withholding certificate, drafted in response to the underlying application, has been signed on behalf of the Service and prior to the day such certificate is mailed to the applicant, the time in which the Service must act upon the amended application shall be extended by 90 days.
(3)
Information required to be submitted.
No particular form is required for an amending statement but the statement must provide the following information:
(i)
Identification of applicant.
The amending statement must set forth the name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the amending statement.
(ii)
Date of application.
The amending statement must set forth the date of the underlying application for a withholding certificate.
(iii)
Real property interest to be (or that has been) transferred.
The amending statement must set forth a brief description of the real property interest with respect to which the underlying application for a withholding certificate was submitted.
(iv)
Amending information.
The amending statement must fully set forth the basis for the amendment including any modification of the facts supporting the application for a withholding certificate and any change sought in the terms of the withholding certificate.
(g)
Early refund of overwithheld amounts.
If the Internal Revenue Service issues a withholding certificate pursuant to this section, and an amount greater than that specified in the certificate was withheld by the entity or fiduciary, then pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (g) a relevant taxpayer may apply for an early refund of a proportionate share of the excess amount (without interest) prior to the date on which the relevant taxpayer's return is due (without extensions). An application for an early refund must be delivered to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10). No particular form is required for the application, but the following information must be set forth in separate paragraphs numbered to correspond with the numbers given below:
(1) Name, address, and identifying number of the relevant taxpayer seeking the refund;
(2) Amount required to be withheld pursuant to withholding certificate;
(3) Amount withheld by entity or fiduciary (attach a copy of Form 8288-A stamped by IRS pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(4) or provide substantial evidence of the amount withheld in the case of a failure to receive Form 8288-A, as provided in § 1.1445-5(b)(7)); and
(4) Amount to be refunded to the relevant taxpayer.
An application for an early refund cannot be processed unless the required copy of Form 8288-A or substantial evidence of the amount withheld in the case of a failure to receive Form 8288-A (as provided in § 1.1445-5(b)(7)) is attached to the application. If an application for a withholding certificate is submitted after the transfer takes place, then that application may be combined with an application for an early refund. The Service will act upon a claim for refund within the time limits set forth in § 1.1445-6(a)(1).
(h)
Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers.
The requirement in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(i), and (g)(1) of this section that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is applicable for dispositions of U.S.
real property interests occurring after November 3, 2003.
[T.D. 8113, 51 FR 46648, Dec. 24, 1986; 52 FR 3796, 3917, Feb. 6, 1987; T.D. 9082, 68 FR 46086, Aug. 5, 2003, as amended by T.D. 9751, 81 FR 8402, Feb. 19, 2016]
§ 1.1445-7
Treatment of foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation.
(a)
In general.
Pursuant to section 897(i) a foreign corporation may elect to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of sections 897 and 6039C. A foreign corporation that has made such an election shall also be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of the withholding required under section 1445, in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
Withholding under section 1445(a)
—(1)
Dispositions by corporation.
A foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) may provide a transferee with a certification of non-foreign status in connection with the corporation's disposition of a U.S. real property interest. However, in accordance with the provisions of §§ 1.1445-2(b)(2)(ii) and 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii)(C), such an electing foreign corporation must attach to such certification a copy of the acknowledgment of the election provided to the corporation by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 1.897-3(d)(4) which states that the information required by § 1.897-3 has been determined to be complete.
(2)
Dispositions of interests in corporation.
Dispositions of interests in electing foreign corporations shall be subject to the withholding requirements of section 1445(a) and the rules of §§ 1.1445-1 through 1.1445-4. Therefore, if a foreign person disposes of an interest in such a corporation, and that interest is a U.S. real property interest under the provisions of section 897 and regulations thereunder, then the transferee is required to withhold under section 1445(a).
(c)
Withholding under section 1445(e).
Because a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) is treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of determining withholding obligations under section 1445, such a corporation is not subject to the requirement of section 1445(e)(2) that a foreign corporation withhold at the corporate capital gain rate from the gain recognized upon the distribution of a U.S. real property interest. Such a corporation is subject to the provisions of section 1445(e)(3). Thus, if interests in an electing corporation constitute U.S. real property interests, then the corporation is required to withhold with respect to the non-dividend distribution of any property to an interest-holder that is a foreign person. See § 1.1445-5(e). Dividend distributions (distributions that are described in section 301) shall be treated as provided in sections 897(f), 1441 and 1442. In addition, if interests in an electing foreign corporation do not constitute U.S. real property interests, then distributions by such corporation shall be treated as provided in sections 897(f) (if applicable), 1441 and 1442.

§ 1.1445-8
Special rules regarding publicly traded partnerships, publicly traded trusts and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
(a)
Entities to which this section applies.
The rules of this section apply to—
(1) Any partnership or trust, interests in which are regularly traded on an established securities market (regardless of the number of its partners or beneficiaries), and
(2) Any REIT (regardless of the form of its organization).
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the rules of section 1445 (e)(1) and this section shall not apply to a publicly traded partnership (as defined in section 7704) which is treated as a corporation under section 7704(a), or to those entities that are classified as “associations” and taxed as corporations. See § 301.7701-2.
(b)
Obligation to withhold
—(1)
In general.
An entity described in paragraph (a) of this section is not required to withhold under the provisions of § 1.1445-5(c), which states the withholding requirements of domestic partnerships, trusts and estates upon the
disposition of U.S. real property interests. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be liable to withhold tax upon the distribution of any amount attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest, with respect to each holder of an interest in the entity that is a foreign person. The amount to be withhold is described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Publicly traded partnerships.
Publicly traded partnerships which comply with the withholding procedures under section 1446 will be deemed to have satisfied their withholding obligations under this paragraph (b).
(3)
Special rule for certain distributions to nominees.
In the case of a person that—
(i) Is a nominee (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section),
(ii) Receives a distribution attributable to the disposition of a U.S. real property interest directly from an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section or indirectly from such entity through a nominee,
(iii) Receives the distribution for payment to any foreign person, or the account of any foreign person, and
(iv) Receives a qualified notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section,
then the obligation to withhold in accordance with the general rules of section 1445(e)(1) and this paragraph (b) shall be imposed solely on that person to the extent of the amount specified by the qualified notice. A person obligated to withhold by reason of this paragraph (b)(3) is referred to as a withholding agent.
(4)
Person designated to act for withholding agent.
The rules stated in § 1.1441-7(b) (1) and (2) regarding a person designated to act for a withholding agent shall apply for purposes of this section.
(5)
Effect of withholding exemption granted under § 1.1441-4(f).
A letter issued by a district director under the provisions of § 1.1441-4(f), which exempts a person from withholding under section 1441 or section 1442, shall also exempt that person from withholding under this paragraph (b), if—
(i) The letter identifies another person as the withholding agent for purposes of section 1441 or 1442, and
(ii) Such other person enters into a written agreement, with the district director who issued the letter, to be the withholding agent for purposes of this paragraph (b).
The exemption granted, and the corresponding withholding obligation imposed, by this paragraph (b)(5) shall apply with respect to the first distribution made after execution of the agreement described in the preceding sentence and shall continue to apply to all distributions made during the period in which the exemption granted under § 1.1441-4(f) is in effect.
(6)
Payment other than in money.
The rule stated in § 1.1441-7(c) regarding payment other than in money shall apply for purposes of this section.
(c)
Amount to be withheld
—(1)
Distribution from a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust.
The amount to be withheld under this section with respect to a distribution by a publicly traded partnership or publicly traded trust shall be computed in the manner described in § 1.1445-5(c)(3) (ii) and (iii), subject to the rules of this section.
(2)
REITs
—(i)
In general.
The amount to be withheld with respect to a distribution by a REIT, under this section shall be equal to the highest rate specified in section 1445(e)(1) multiplied by the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Amount subject to withholding
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the amount subject to withholding is the amount of any distribution, determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend, multiplied by the number of shares or certificates of beneficial interest owned by the foreign person. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the largest amount of any distribution occurring after March 7, 1991 that could be designated as a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3)(C) shall be deemed to have been designated by a REIT as a capital gain dividend regardless of the amount actually designated.
(B)
Distribution attributable to net short-term capital gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest.
[Reserved]
(C)
Designation of prior distribution as capital gain dividend.
If a REIT makes an actual designation of a prior distribution, in whole or in part, as a capital gain dividend, such prior distribution shall not be subject to withholding under this section. Rather, a REIT must characterize and treat as a capital gain dividend distribution (solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1)) each distribution, determined with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest, made on the day of, or any time subsequent to, such designation as a capital gain dividend until such characterized amounts equal the amount of the prior distribution designated as a capital gain dividend. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable in any taxable year in which the REIT adopts a formal or informal resolution or plan of complete liquidation.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
In the first quarter of 1988, XYZ REIT makes a dividend distribution of $2X. In the second quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real property, recognizing a long term capital gain of $15X, and makes a dividend distribution of $5X. In the third quarter of 1988, XYZ makes a distribution of $3X. In the fourth quarter of 1988, XYZ sells real property recognizing a long term capital loss of $2X. Within 30 days after the close of the taxable year, XYZ designates a capital gain dividend for the year of $13X. It subsequently makes a fourth quarter distribution of $7X. Since XYZ has made an actual designation of prior distributions during the taxable year as capital gain dividends, withholding on those prior distributions will not be required. However, the REIT must characterize, solely for purposes of section 1445(e)(1), a total amount of $13X of dividend distributions as capital gain dividends. Therefore, the fourth quarter dividend distribution of $7X must be characterized as a capital gain dividend subject to withholding under this section. In addition, XYZ will be required to characterize an additional $6X of subsequent dividend distributions as capital gain dividends.
(d)
Definition of nominee.
For purposes of this section, the term “nominee” means a domestic person that holds an interest in an entity described in paragraph (a) of this section on behalf of another domestic or foreign person.
(e)
Determination of non-foreign status by withholding agent.
A withholding agent may rely on a certification of non-foreign status pursuant to § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii) to determine whether an interest holder is not a foreign person. Reliance on these documents will excuse the withholding agent from liability imposed under section 1445(e)(1) in the absence of actual knowledge that the interest holder is a foreign person. A withholding agent may also employ other means to determine the status of an interest holder, but, if the agent relies on such other means and the interest holder proves, in fact, to be a foreign person (or, is not a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and therefore is not treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of withholding under section 1445), then the withholding agent is subject to any liability imposed pursuant to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder for failure to withhold. See also § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii)(B)(
3
) for the period during which a withholding agent may rely on a certification of non-foreign status submitted by a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)), which applies under this paragraph (e).
(f)
Qualified notice.
A qualified notice for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section is a notice provided in the manner described in § 1.1446-4(b)(4) by a partnership, trust, or REIT regarding a distribution that is attributable to the disposition of a United States real property interest. In the case of a REIT, a qualified notice is only a notice of a distribution, all or any portion of which the REIT actually designates, or characterizes in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, as a capital gain dividend in the manner described in § 1.1446-4(b)(4), with respect to each share or certificate of beneficial interest. A deemed designation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may not be the subject of a qualified notice under this paragraph (f). A person described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is treated as receiving a qualified notice when the notice is provided in accordance with § 1.1446-4(b)(4).
(g)
Reporting and paying over withheld amounts.
With respect to an amount withheld under this section, a withholding agent is not required to conform to the requirements of § 1.1445-5(b)(5) but is required to report and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service any amount required to be withheld pursuant to the rules and procedures of section 1461, the regulations thereunder and § 1.6302-2. Forms 1042 and 1042S are to be used for this purpose.
(h)
Early refund procedure not available.
The early refund procedure set forth in § 1.1445-6(g) shall not apply to amounts withheld under the rules of this section. For adjustment of over-withheld amounts, see § 1.1461.4.
(i)
Liability upon failure to withhold.
For rules regarding liability upon failure to withhold under § 1445(e) and this section, see § 1.1445-1(e).
(j)
Applicability dates.
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to distributions on or after November 30, 2020. Paragraph (e) of this section applies with respect to distributions made on or after December 29, 2022. For distributions made before December 29, 2022, see § 1.1445-8(e) as contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2021. Paragraph (f) of this section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2022. For distributions made before January 1, 2022, see § 1.1445-8(f) as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2020.
[T.D. 8321, 55 FR 50553, Dec. 7, 1990; 56 FR 4542, Feb. 5, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8647, 60 FR 66077, Dec. 21, 1995; T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76932, Nov. 30, 2020; T.D. 9971, 87 FR 80066, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 1.1445-10T
Special rule for Foreign governments (temporary).
(a) This section provides a temporary regulation that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will add a new paragraph (d)(6) to § 1.1445-2. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1445-2.
(b)
Foreign government
—(1)
As transferor.
A foreign government is subject to U.S. taxation under section 897 on the disposition of a U.S. real property interest except to the extent specifically otherwise provided in the regulations issued under section 892. A foreign government that disposes of a U.S. real property interest that is not subject to taxation as specifically provided by the regulations under section 892 may present a notice of nonrecognition treatment pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section that specifically cites the provision of such regulation, and thereby avoids withholding by the transferee of the property. A foreign government that disposes of a U.S. real property interest or the transferee of the property may obtain a withholding certificate from the Internal Revenue Service that confirms the applicability of section 892, but neither is required to do so. Rules concerning the issuance of withholding certificates are provided in § 1.1445-3.
(2)
As transferee.
A foreign government or international organization that acquires a U.S. real property interest is fully subject to section 1445 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, such an entity is required to withhold tax upon the acquisition of a U.S. real property interest from a foreign person.
(c)
Effective date.
The rules of this section shall be effective for transfers, exchanges, distributions and other dispositions occurring on or after June 6, 1988.
[T.D. 8198, 53 FR 16230, May 5, 1988]
§ 1.1445-11T
Special rules requiring withholding under § 1.1445-5 (temporary).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides temporary regulations that, if and when adopted as a final regulation will add certain new paragraphs within § 1.1445-5 (b) and (c). The paragraphs of this section would then appear as set forth below. Paragraph (b) of this section would then appear as paragraph (b)(8)(v) of § 1.1445-5. Paragraph (c) of this section would then appear as paragraph (c)(2)(i) of § 1.1445-5. Paragraph (d) of this section would then appear as paragraph (g) of § 1.1445-5.
(b)
Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates.
The provisions of section 1445(e)(5), requiring withholding upon certain dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts, and estates, that own directly or indirectly a U.S. real property interest shall apply to dispositions on or after the effective date of a later Treasury decision under
section 897(g) of the Code except in the case of dispositions of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. The provisions of section 1445(e)(5), shall apply, however, to dispositions after June 6, 1988, of interests in partnerships in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. See paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Transactions covered elsewhere.
No withholding is required under this paragraph (c) with respect to the distribution of a U.S. real property interest by a partnership, trust, or estate. Such distributions shall be subject to withholding under section 1445(e)(4) and paragraph (f) of this § 1.1445-5 on the effective date of a later Treasury decision published under section 897(g) of the Code. No withholding is required at this time for distributions described in the preceding sentence. See paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this § 1.1445-5. No withholding is required under this paragraph with respect to the disposition of an interest in a trust, estate, or partnership except in the case of a partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. See paragraph (b)(8)(v) of § 1.1445-5. Withholding shall be required as provided in section 1445(e)(5) and paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the disposition after June 6, 1988, of an interest in a partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents.
(d)
Dispositions of interests in partnerships, trusts or estates
—(1)
Withholding required on disposition of certain partnership interests.
Withholding is required under section 1445(e)(5) and this paragraph with respect to the disposition by a foreign partner of an interest in a domestic or foreign partnership in which fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents. For purposes of this paragraph cash equivalents mean any asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. dollars), including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments. The taxpayer on filing an income tax return for the year of the disposition may demonstrate the extent to which the gain on the disposition of the interest is not attributable to U.S. real property interests. A taxpayer is also permitted by § 1.1445-3 to apply for a withholding certificate in instances where reduced withholding is appropriate.
(2)
Withholding not required
—(i)
Transferee receives statement that interest in partnership is not described in paragraph (d)(1).
No withholding is required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon the disposition of a partnership interest otherwise described in that paragraph if the transferee is provided a statement, issued by the partnership and signed by a general partner under penalties of perjury no earlier than 30 days before the transfer, certifying that fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets does not consist of U.S. real property interests, or that ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets of the partnership does not consist of U.S. real property interests plus cash or cash equivalents.
(ii)
Reliance on statement not permitted.
A transferee is not entitled to rely upon a statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if, prior to or at the time of the transfer, the transferee either—
(A) Has actual knowledge that the statement is false, or
(B) Receives a notice, pursuant to § 1.1445-4.
Such a transferee's withholding obligations shall apply as if the statement had never been given, and such a transferee may be held fully liable pursuant to § 1.1445-1(e) for any failure to withhold.
(iii)
Belated notice of false statement.
If, after the date of the transfer, a transferee receives notice that a statement provided under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is false, then such transferee may rely on the statement only with respect to consideration that was paid prior to the receipt of the notice. Such a transferee is required to withhold a full 10 percent of the amount realized from the consideration that remains to be paid to the transferor. Thus, if 10 percent or more of the amount realized remains to be paid to the transferor, then the transferee is required to withhold and pay over the full 10 percent. The transferee must do so by withholding and paying over the entire amount of each successive payment of consideration to the transferor, until the full 10 percent of the amount realized has been withheld and paid over. Amounts so withheld must be reported and paid over by the 20th day following the date on which each such payment of consideration is made. A transferee that is subject to the rules of this § 1.1445-10T(d)(2)(iii) may not obtain a withholding certificate pursuant to § 1.1445-3, but must instead withhold and pay over the amounts required by this paragraph.

# § 1.1446-7 Applicability dates.
[T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28717, May 18, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9394, 73 FR 23074, Apr. 29, 2008; T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76933, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1446-1
Withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected taxable income.
(a)
In general.
If a domestic or foreign partnership has effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) as computed under § 1.1446-2 for any partnership tax year, and any portion of such taxable income is allocable under section 704 to a foreign partner, then the partnership must pay a withholding tax under section 1446 (1446 tax) at the time and in the manner prescribed in this section, and §§ 1.1446-2 through 1.1446-6.
(b)
Steps in determining 1446 tax obligation.
In general, a partnership determines its 1446 tax as follows. The partnership determines whether it has any foreign partners in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the partnership does not have any foreign partners (including any person presumed to be foreign under paragraph (c) of this section and any domestic trust treated as foreign under § 1.1446-3(d)) during its taxable year, it generally will not have a 1446 tax obligation. If the partnership has one or more foreign partners, it then determines under § 1.1446-2 whether it has ECTI any portion of which is allocable under section 704 to one or more of the foreign partners. If the partnership has
ECTI allocable under section 704 to one or more of its foreign partners, the partnership computes its 1446 tax, pays over 1446 tax, and reports the amount paid in accordance with the rules in § 1.1446-3. For special rules applicable to publicly traded partnerships, see § 1.1446-4. For special rules applicable to tiered partnership structures, see § 1.1446-5. For special rules that may apply in determining the amount of 1446 tax due with respect to a partner, see § 1.1446-6.
(c)
Determining whether a partnership has a foreign partner
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, § 1.1446-3, and § 1.1446-5, only a partnership that has at least one foreign partner during the partnership's taxable year can have a 1446 tax liability. Generally, the term foreign partner means any partner of the partnership that is not a U.S. person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). Thus, a partner of the partnership is generally a foreign partner if the partner is a nonresident alien, foreign partnership (see § 1.1446-5 for rules that allow a lower-tier partnership to look through an upper-tier foreign partnership to the partners of such partnership for purposes of computing its 1446 tax), foreign corporation (which includes a foreign government pursuant to section 892(a)(3)), foreign estate or trust (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section for rules that instruct a partnership to consider the grantor or other owner of a trust under subpart E of subchapter J as the partner for purposes of computing the partnership's 1446 tax), as those terms are defined under section 7701 and the regulations thereunder, or a foreign organization described in section 501(c), or other foreign person. A person also is a foreign partner if the person is presumed to be a foreign person under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of this section, a partner that is treated as a U.S. person for all income tax purposes (by election or otherwise, see e.g., sections 953(d) and 1504(d)) will not be a foreign partner, provided the partner has provided the partnership a valid Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” or the partnership uses other means to determine that the partner is not a foreign partner (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). A partner that is treated as a U.S. person only for certain specified purposes is considered a foreign partner for purposes of section 1446, and a partnership must pay 1446 tax on the portion of ECTI allocable to that partner. For example, a partnership must generally pay 1446 tax on ECTI allocable to a foreign corporate partner that has made an election under section 897(i).
(2)
Submission of Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-9
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a partnership must generally determine whether a partner is a foreign partner, and the partner's tax classification (e.g., corporate or non-corporate), by obtaining a withholding certificate from the partner that is a Form W-8BEN, “Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding,” Form W-8IMY, “Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding,” Form W-8ECI, “Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States,” Form W-8EXP, “Certificate of Foreign Government or other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding,” or a Form W-9, as applicable, or an acceptable substitute form permitted under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Generally, a foreign partner that is a nonresident alien, a foreign estate or trust (other than a grantor trust described in this paragraph (c)(2)), a foreign corporation, or a foreign government should provide a valid Form W-8BEN.
(ii)
Withholding certificate applicable to each type of partner.
A partner that submits a valid Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will generally satisfy the documentation requirements of this section provided that the submission of such form is not inconsistent with the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The following rules shall apply for purposes of this section.
(A)
U.S. person.
A partner that is a U.S. person (other than a grantor trust described in this paragraph (c)(2)), including a domestic partnership and domestic simple or complex trust (including an estate), shall provide a valid Form W-9.
(B)
Nonresident alien.
A Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) submitted by a nonresident alien for purposes of withholding under section 1441 will generally be accepted for purposes of section 1446. If no such form is submitted for purposes of section 1441, such nonresident alien shall submit Form W-8BEN for purposes of section 1446.
(C)
Foreign partnership.
A partner that is a foreign partnership generally shall provide a valid Form W-8IMY for purposes of section 1446. See § 1.1446-5 (permitting a lower-tier partnership to look through an upper-tier foreign partnership in certain circumstances when computing 1446 tax).
(D)
Disregarded entities.
An entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter (whether domestic or foreign) shall not submit a Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) or Form W-9. Instead, the owner of such entity for Federal tax purposes shall submit appropriate documentation to comply with this section. See §§ 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3 of this chapter for determining the U.S. Federal tax classification of a partner.
(E)
Domestic and foreign grantor trusts.
To the extent that a grantor or other person is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust under subpart E of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code, such trust shall provide documentation under this paragraph (c)(2) to identify the trust as a grantor trust and provide documentation on behalf of the grantor or other person treated as the owner of all or a portion of such trust as required by this paragraph (c)(2). If such trust is a foreign trust, the trust shall submit Form W-8IMY to the partnership identifying itself as a foreign grantor trust and shall provide such documentation (e.g., Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-9) and information pertaining to its grantor or other owner to the partnership that permits the partnership to reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) such portion of the trust's allocable share of partnership ECTI with the grantor or other person that is the owner of such portion of the trust. If such trust is a domestic trust, the trust shall furnish the partnership a statement under penalty of perjury that the trust is, in whole or in part, a domestic grantor trust and such statement shall identify that portion of the trust that is treated as owned by a grantor or another person under subpart E of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code. The trust shall also provide such documentation and information (e.g., Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-9) pertaining to its grantor or other owner(s) to the partnership that permits the partnership to reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) such portion of the trust's allocable share of partnership ECTI with the grantor or other person that is the owner of such portion of the trust.
(F)
Nominees.
Where a nominee holds an interest in a partnership on behalf of another person, the beneficial owner of the partnership interest, not the nominee, shall submit a Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) or Form W-9 to the partnership or nominee that is the withholding agent.
(G)
Foreign governments, foreign tax-exempt organizations and other foreign persons.
A Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8EXP) submitted by a partner that is a foreign government, foreign tax-exempt organization, or other foreign person for purposes of withholding under §§ 1441 through 1443 will also operate to establish the foreign status of such partner under this section. However, except as set forth in § 1.1446-2(b)(4)(iii) (regarding withholding qualified holders (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)) and § 1.1446-3(c)(3) (regarding certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)), the submission of Form W-8EXP (or successor) will have no effect on whether there is a 1446 tax due with respect to such partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI. For example, a partnership must still pay 1446 tax with respect to a foreign government partner's allocable share of ECTI because such partner is treated as a foreign corporation under
section 892(a)(3). If no Form W-8 is submitted for purposes of withholding under sections 1441 through 1443, then such government, tax-exempt organization, or person must generally submit Form W-8BEN.
(H)
Foreign corporations, certain foreign trusts, and foreign estates.
Consistent with the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a foreign corporation, a foreign trust (other than a foreign grantor trust described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section), or a foreign estate may generally submit any appropriate Form W-8 (for example, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY) to the partnership to establish its foreign status for purposes of section 1446. In addition, a foreign entity may also submit a certification of non-foreign status (including a Form W-8EXP) described in § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii) for purposes of documenting itself as a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)).
(iii)
Effect of Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W-9, and statement
—(A)
Partnership reliance on withholding certificate.
In general, for purposes of this section, a partnership may rely on a valid Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) or Form W-9, or statement described in this paragraph (c)(2) from a partner, beneficial owner, or grantor trust to determine whether that person, beneficial owner, or the owner of a grantor trust, is a non-foreign or foreign partner for purposes of computing 1446 tax, and if such person is a foreign partner, to determine whether or not such person is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes. The rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply to a partnership that receives a Form W-8IMY from a foreign grantor trust or a statement described in this paragraph (c)(2) from a domestic grantor trust, but does not receive a Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) or Form W-9 identifying such grantor or other person. Further, a partnership may not rely on a Form W-8 or Form W-9, or statement described in this paragraph (c)(2), and such form or statement is therefore not valid for any installment period or Form 8804 filing date during which the partnership has actual knowledge or has reason to know that any information on the withholding certificate or statement is incorrect or unreliable and, if based on such knowledge or reason to know, the partnership should pay 1446 tax in an amount greater than would be the case if it relied on the certificate or statement.
(B)
Reason to know.
A partnership has reason to know that information on a withholding certificate or statement is incorrect or unreliable if its knowledge of relevant facts or statements contained on the form or other documentation is such that a reasonably prudent person in the position of the withholding agent would question the claims made. See §§ 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii) and 1.1441-7(b)(1) and (2).
(C)
Subsequent knowledge and impact on penalties.
If the partnership does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that a Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, Form W-9, or statement received from a partner, beneficial owner, or grantor trust contains incorrect or unreliable information, but it subsequently determines that the certificate or statement contains incorrect or unreliable information, and, based on such knowledge the partnership should pay 1446 tax in an amount greater than would be the case if it relied on the certificate or statement, then the partnership will not be subject to penalties for its failure to pay the 1446 tax in reliance on such certificate or statement for any installment payment date prior to the date that the determination is made. See §§ 1.1446-1(c)(4) and 1.1446-3 concerning penalties for failure to pay the withholding tax when a partnership knows or has reason to know that a withholding certificate or statement is incorrect or unreliable.
(iv)
Requirements for certificates to be valid.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), for purposes of this section, the validity of a Form W-9 shall be determined under section 3406 and § 31.3406(h)-3(e) of this chapter which establish when such form may be reasonably relied upon. A Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, or Form W-8EXP is only valid for purposes of this section if its validity period has not expired, the partner submitting the form has signed it under
penalties of perjury, and it contains all the required information.
(A)
When period of validity expires.
For purposes of this section, a Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, or Form W-8EXP submitted by a partner shall be valid until the end of the period of validity determined for such form under § 1.1441-1(e). With respect to a foreign partnership submitting Form W-8IMY, the period of validity of such form shall be determined under § 1.1441-1(e) as if such foreign partnership submitted the form required of a nonwithholding foreign partnership. See § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii).
(B)
Required information for Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, and W-8EXP.
Forms W-8BEN, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, and W-8EXP submitted under this section must contain the partner's name, permanent address and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), the country under the laws of which the partner is formed, incorporated or governed (if the person is not an individual), the classification of the partner for U.S. Federal tax purposes (e.g., partnership, corporation), and any other information required to be submitted by the forms or instructions for such form, as applicable.
(v)
Partner must provide new withholding certificate when there is a change in circumstances.
The principles of § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) shall apply when a change in circumstances has occurred (including situations where the status of a U.S. person changes) that requires a partner to provide a new withholding certificate.
(vi)
Partnership must retain withholding certificates.
A partnership or nominee who has responsibility for paying 1446 tax under this section or § 1.1446-4 must retain each withholding certificate, statement, and other information received from its direct and indirect partners for as long as it may be relevant to the determination of the withholding agent's 1446 tax liability under section 1461 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Presumptions in the absence of valid Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, Form W-9, or statement.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3), a partnership that does not receive a valid Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, Form W-9, or statement required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section from a partner, beneficial owner, or grantor trust, or a partnership that receives a withholding certificate or statement but has actual knowledge or reason to know that the information on the certificate or statement is incorrect or unreliable, must presume that the partner is a foreign person. Except as provided in § 1.1446-3(a)(2) and § 1.1446-5(c)(2), a partnership that knows that a partner is an individual shall treat the partner as a nonresident alien. Except as provided in § 1.1446-3(a)(2) and § 1.1446-5(c)(2), a partnership that knows that a partner is an entity shall treat the partner as a corporation if the entity is a corporation as defined in § 301.7701-2(b)(8) of this chapter. See § 1.1446-3(a)(2) which prohibits a partnership in certain circumstances from considering preferential tax rates in computing its 1446 tax when the presumption and rules of this paragraph (c)(3) apply. In all other cases, the partnership shall treat the partner as either a nonresident alien or a foreign corporation, whichever classification results in a higher 1446 tax being due, and shall pay the 1446 tax in accordance with this presumption. Except as provided in § 1.1446-5(c)(2), the presumption set forth in this paragraph (c)(3) that a partner is a foreign person shall not apply to the extent that the partnership relies on other means to ascertain the non-foreign status of a partner and the partnership is correct in its determination that such partner is a U.S. person. A partnership is in no event required to rely upon other means to determine the non-foreign status of a partner and may demand that a partner furnish an acceptable certificate under this section. If a certificate is not provided in such circumstances, the partnership may presume that the partner is a foreign partner, and for purposes of sections 1461 through 1463, will be considered to have been required to pay 1446 tax on such partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI.
(4)
Consequences when partnership knows or has reason to know that Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, or Form W-9 is incorrect
or unreliable and does not withhold.
If a partnership has actual knowledge or has reason to know that a Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, Form W-9, or statement required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section submitted by a partner, beneficial owner, or grantor trust contains incorrect or unreliable information (either because the certificate or statement when given to the partnership contained incorrect information or because there has been a change in facts that makes information on the certificate or statement incorrect), and the partnership pays less than the full amount of 1446 tax due on ECTI allocable to that partner, the partnership shall be fully liable under section 1461 and § 1.1461-3 (§ 1.1461-1 for publicly traded partnerships subject to § 1.1446-4) and § 1.1446-3, and for all applicable penalties and interest, for any failure to pay the 1446 tax for the period during which the partnership has such knowledge or reason to know that the certificate contained incorrect or unreliable information and for all subsequent installment periods. If a partner, beneficial owner, or grantor trust submits a new valid Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP, Form W-9, or statement, as applicable, the partnership may rely on that documentation when paying 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) for any payment date that has not passed at the time such form is received.
(5)
Acceptable substitute form.
A partnership or withholding agent responsible for paying 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) may substitute its own form for the official version of Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) that is recognized under this section to ascertain the identity of its partners, provided such form is consistent with § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vi). All references under this section or §§ 1.1446-2 through 1.1446-6 to a Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP) shall include the acceptable substitute form recognized under this paragraph (c)(5).
[T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28717, May 18, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9394, 73 FR 23074, Apr. 29, 2008; T.D. 9971, 87 FR 80066, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 1.1446-2
Determining a partnership's effectively connected taxable income allocable to foreign partners under section 704.
(a)
In general.
A partnership's effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) is generally the partnership's taxable income as computed under section 703, with adjustments as provided in section 1446(c) and this section, and computed with consideration of only those partnership items which are effectively connected (or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For purposes of determining the section 1446 withholding tax (1446 tax) or any installment of such tax under § 1.1446-3, partnership ECTI allocable under section 704 to foreign partners is the sum of the allocable shares of ECTI of each of the partnership's foreign partners as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. See § 1.1446-6 (special rules permitting the partnership to consider partner-level deductions and losses to reduce the partnership's 1446 tax). The calculation of partnership ECTI allocable to foreign partners as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and the partnership's withholding tax obligation are partnership-level computations solely for purposes of determining the 1446 tax. Therefore, any deduction that is not taken into account in calculating a partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI (e.g., percentage depletion), but which is a deduction that under U.S. tax law the foreign partner is otherwise entitled to claim, can still be claimed by the foreign partner when computing its U.S. tax liability and filing its U.S. income tax return, subject to any restriction or limitation that otherwise may apply.
(b)
Computation
—(1)
In general.
A foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI for the partnership's taxable year that is allocable under section 704 to a particular foreign partner is equal to that foreign partner's distributive share of partnership gross income and gain for the partnership's taxable year that is effectively connected and properly allocable to the partner under section 704 and the regulations thereunder, reduced by the foreign partner's distributive share of
partnership deductions for the partnership taxable year that are connected with such income under section 873(a) or 882(c) and properly allocable to the partner under section 704 and the regulations thereunder, in each case, after application of the rules of this section. See § 1.1446-6 (special rules permitting the partnership to consider partner-level deductions and losses to reduce the partnership's 1446 tax). For these purposes, a foreign partner's distributive share of effectively connected gross income and gain and the deductions connected with such income shall be computed by considering allocations that are respected under the rules of section 704 and § 1.704-1(b)(1), including special allocations in the partnership agreement (as defined in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h)), and adjustments to the basis of partnership property described in section 743 pursuant to an election by the partnership under section 754 (see § 1.743-1(j)). The character of effectively connected partnership items (capital versus ordinary) shall be separately considered only to the extent set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section and, when applicable, sections 1.1446-3(a)(2)(consideration of preferential rates when computing 1446 tax) and section 1.1446-6 (special rules permitting the partnership to consider partner-level deductions and losses to reduce the partnership's 1446 tax).
(2)
Income and gain rules.
For purposes of computing a foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI under this paragraph (b), the following rules shall apply with respect to partnership income and gain.
(i)
Application of the principles of section 864.
The determination of whether a partnership's items of gross income are effectively connected shall be made by applying the principles of section 864 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Income treated as effectively connected.
A partnership's items of gross income that are effectively connected include any income that is treated as effectively connected income, including partnership income subject to a partner's election under section 871(d) or section 882(d), any partnership income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business pursuant to section 897, and any other items of partnership income treated as effectively connected under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to whether those amounts are taxable to the partner. A partner that makes the election under section 871(d) or section 882(d) shall furnish to the partnership a statement that indicates that such election has been made. See § 1.871-10(d)(3). If a partnership receives a valid Form W-8ECI from a partner, the partner is deemed, for purposes of section 1446, to have effectively connected income subject to withholding under section 1446 to the extent of the items identified on the form.
(iii)
Exempt income.
A foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI does not include income or gain exempt from U.S. tax by reason of a provision of the Internal Revenue Code. A foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI also does not include income or gain exempt from U.S. tax by operation of any U.S. income tax treaty or reciprocal agreement. In the case of income excluded by reason of a treaty provision, such income must be derived by a resident of an applicable treaty jurisdiction, the resident must be the beneficial owner of the item, and all other requirements for benefits under the treaty must be satisfied. The partnership must have received from the partner a valid withholding certificate, that is, Form W-8BEN (see § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(iii) regarding when a Form W-8BEN is valid for purposes of this section), containing the information necessary to support the claim for treaty benefits required in the forms and instructions. In addition, for purposes of this section, the withholding certificate must contain the beneficial owner's taxpayer identification number.
(3)
Deductions and losses.
For purposes of computing a foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI under this paragraph (b), the following rules shall apply with respect to deductions and losses.
(i)
Oil and gas interests.
The deduction for depletion with respect to oil and gas wells shall be allowed, but the amount of such deduction shall be determined without regard to sections 613 and 613A.
(ii)
Charitable contributions.
The deduction for charitable contributions provided in section 170 shall not be allowed.
(iii)
Net operating losses and other suspended or carried losses.
Except as provided in § 1.1446-6, the net operating loss deduction of any foreign partner provided in section 172 shall not be taken into account. Further, except as provided in § 1.1446-6, the partnership shall not take into account any suspended losses (e.g., losses in excess of a partner's basis in the partnership, see section 704(d)) or any capital loss carrybacks or carryovers available to a foreign partner.
(iv)
Interest deductions.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of interest expense that is allocable to income which is (or is treated as) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business for purposes of calculating a foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI. In the case of a non-corporate foreign partner, the rules of § 1.861-9T(e)(7) shall apply. In the case of a corporate foreign partner, the rules of § 1.882-5 shall apply by treating the partnership as a foreign corporation and using the partner's pro-rata share of the partnership's assets and liabilities for these purposes. For these purposes, the rules governing elections under § 1.882-5(a)(7) shall be made at the partnership level.
(v)
Limitation on capital losses.
Losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets allocable under section 704 to a partner shall be allowed only to the extent of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets allocable under section 704 to such partner.
(vi)
Other deductions.
No deduction shall be allowed for personal exemptions provided in section 151 or the additional itemized deductions for individuals provided in part VII of subchapter B of the Internal Revenue Code (section 211 and following).
(vii)
Limitations on deductions.
Except as provided in § 1.1446-6 and this paragraph (b)(3), any limitations on losses or deductions that apply at the partner level when determining ECTI allocable to a foreign partner shall not be taken into account.
(4)
Other rules
—(i)
Exclusion of items allocated to U.S. partners.
Except as provided in § 1.1446-5(e), in computing partnership ECTI, the partnership shall not take into account any item of income, gain, loss, or deduction to the extent allocable to any partner that is not a foreign partner, as that term is defined in § 1.1446-1(c).
(ii)
Partnership credits.
See § 1.1446-3(a) providing that the 1446 tax is computed without regard to a partner's distributive share of the partnership's tax credits.
(iii)
Special rule for qualified holders.
With respect to a foreign partner that is a withholding qualified holder (as defined in § 1.1445-1(g)(11)), the foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI does not include gain or loss that is not taken into account under § 1.897(l)-1(b) and that is not otherwise treated as effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. The partnership must have received from the partner a valid certificate of non-foreign status (including a Form W-8EXP) described in § 1.1445-2(b)(2)(i) or § 1.1445-5(b)(3)(ii). See § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(ii)(G) and (H) regarding documentation of withholding qualified holders.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. In considering the examples, disregard the potential application of § 1.1446-3(b)(2)(v)(F) (relating to the de minimis exception to paying 1446 tax). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Limitation on capital losses.
PRS partnership has two equal partners, A and B. A is a nonresident alien and B is a U.S. citizen. A provides PRS with a valid Form W-8BEN, and B provides PRS with a valid Form W-9. PRS has the following annualized tax items for the relevant installment period, all of which are effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business and are allocated equally between A and B: $100 of long-term capital gain, $400 of long-term capital loss, $300 of ordinary income, and $100 of ordinary deductions. Assume that these allocations are respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. Accordingly, A's allocable share of PRS's effectively connected items includes $50 of long-term capital gain, $200 of long-term capital loss, $150 of ordinary income, and $50 of ordinary deductions. In determining A's allocable share of partnership ECTI, the amount of the long-term capital loss that may be taken into account
pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section is limited to A's allocable share of gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets. Accordingly, A's share of partnership ECTI allocable under section 704 pursuant to § 1.1446-2 is $100 ($150 of ordinary income less $50 of ordinary deductions, plus $50 of capital gain less $50 of capital loss).

# Example 2. Limitation on capital losses—special allocations.
PRS partnership has two equal partners, A and B. A and B are both nonresident aliens. A and B each provide PRS with a valid Form W-8BEN. PRS has the following annualized tax items for the relevant installment period, all of which are effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business: $200 of long-term capital gain, $200 of long-term capital loss, and $400 of ordinary income. A and B have equal shares in the ordinary income, however, pursuant to the partnership agreement, capital gains and losses are subject to special allocations. The long-term capital gain is allocable to A, and the long-term capital loss is allocable to B. Assume that these allocations are respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, A's allocable share of partnership ECTI under § 1.1446-2 is $400 (consisting of $200 of ordinary income and $200 of long-term capital gain), and B's allocable share of partnership ECTI is $200 (consisting of $200 of ordinary income).

# Example 3. Withholding tax obligation where partner has net operating losses.
PRS partnership has two equal partners, FC, a foreign corporation, and DC, a domestic corporation. FC and DC provide a valid Form W-8BEN and Form W-9, respectively, to PRS. Both FC and PRS are on a calendar taxable year. PRS is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and for its first installment period during its taxable year has $100 of annualized ECTI that is allocable to FC. As of the beginning of the taxable year, FC had an unused effectively connected net operating loss carryover in the amount of $300. FC's net operating loss carryover is not taken into account in determining FC's allocable share of partnership ECTI under § 1.1446-2 and, absent the application of § 1.1446-6 (permitting a foreign partner to certify deductions and losses reasonably expected to be available to reduce the partner's U.S. income tax liability on the effectively connected income or gain allocable from the partnership), is not considered in computing the 1446 tax installment payment due on behalf of FC. Accordingly, PRS must pay 1446 tax with respect to the $100 of ECTI allocable to FC.

§ 1.1446-3
Time and manner of calculating and paying over the 1446 tax.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Calculating 1446 tax.
This section provides rules for calculating, reporting, and paying over the section 1446 withholding tax (1446 tax). A partnership's 1446 tax equals the amount determined under this section and shall be paid in installments during the partnership's taxable year (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section for installment payment due dates), with any remaining tax due paid with the partnership's annual return required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. For these purposes, a partnership shall not take into account either a partner's liability for any other tax imposed under any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., section 55 or 884) or a partner's distributive share of the partnership's tax credits when determining the amount of the partnership's 1446 tax.
(2)
Applicable percentage
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(2), in the case of a foreign partner that is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, the applicable percentage is the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) for such taxable year. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(2) and § 1.1446-5, in the case of a foreign partner that is not a corporation for U.S. tax purposes (e.g., a partnership, individual, trust or estate), the applicable percentage is the highest rate of tax specified in section 1.
(ii)
Special types of income or gain.
Except as otherwise provided, a partnership is permitted to consider as the applicable percentage under this paragraph (a)(2) the highest rate of tax applicable to a particular type of income or gain allocable to a partner (e.g., long-term capital gain allocable to a non-corporate partner, unrecaptured section 1250 gain, collectibles gain under section 1(h)), to the extent of a partner's allocable share of such income or gain. Consideration of the highest rate of tax applicable to a particular type of income or gain under the previous sentence shall be made without regard to the amount of such partner's income. A partnership is not permitted to consider the highest rate of tax applicable to a particular type of income or gain under this paragraph
(a)(2)(ii) if the application of the preferential rate depends upon the corporate or non-corporate status of the person reporting the income or gain and, either no documentation has been provided to the partnership under § 1.1446-1 to establish the corporate or non-corporate status of the partner required to pay tax on the income or gain, or the partnership is otherwise required to compute and pay 1446 tax on such portion of the income or gain using the highest applicable percentage under section 1446(b). See e.g., §§ 1.1446-1(c)(3) (presumption of foreign status in the absence of documentation) and 1.1446-5(c)(2) (requirement to pay 1446 tax at higher of rates in section 1446(b) where a lower-tier partnership cannot reliably associate income with a partner of the upper-tier partnership).
(b)
Installment payments
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.1446-4 for certain publicly traded partnerships, a partnership must pay its 1446 tax by making installment payments of the 1446 tax based on the amount of partnership effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable under section 704 to its foreign partners, without regard to whether the partnership makes any distributions to its partners during the partnership's taxable year. The amount of the installment payments is determined in accordance with this paragraph (b), and the tax must be paid at the times set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Subject to paragraphs (b)(2)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in computing its first installment of 1446 tax for a taxable year, a partnership must decide whether it will pay its 1446 tax for the entire taxable year by using the safe harbor set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, or by using one of several annualization methods available under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for computing partnership ECTI allocable to foreign partners. In the case of a partnership's underpayment of an installment of 1446 tax, the partnership shall be subject to an addition to the tax equal to the amount determined under section 6655, as modified by this section, as if such partnership were a corporation, as well as any other applicable interest and penalties. See § 1.1446-3(f). Section 6425 (permitting an adjustment for an overpayment of estimated tax by a corporation) shall not apply to a partnership's payment of its 1446 tax.
(2)
Calculation
—(i)
Application of the principles of section 6655
—(A)
In general.
Installment payments of 1446 tax required during the partnership's taxable year are based upon partnership ECTI for the portion of the partnership taxable year to which the payments relate, and, except as set forth in this paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall be calculated using the principles of section 6655. The principles of section 6655, except as otherwise provided in § 1.6655-2, are applied to annualize the partnership's items of effectively connected income, gain, loss, and deduction to determine each foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI. Each foreign partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI is then multiplied by the relevant applicable percentage for the type of income allocable to the foreign partner under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The respective 1446 tax amounts are then added for each foreign partner to yield an annualized 1446 tax with respect to such partner. The installment of 1446 tax due with respect to a foreign partner equals the excess of the section 6655(e)(2)(B)(ii) percentage of the annualized 1446 tax for that partner (or, if applicable, the adjusted seasonal amount) for the relevant installment period, over the aggregate amount of 1446 tax installment payments previously paid with respect to that partner during the partnership's taxable year. The partnership's total 1446 tax installment payment equals the sum of the installment payments due for such period on behalf of all the partnership's foreign partners.
(B)
Calculation rules when certificates are submitted under § 1.1446-6.
(
1
) To the extent applicable, in computing the 1446 tax due with respect to a foreign partner, a partnership may consider a certificate received from such partner under § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(i) or (ii) and the amount of state and local taxes permitted to be considered under § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(iii). For the purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B), a partnership shall first annualize the partner's allocable share of the partnership's
items of effectively connected income, gain, deduction, and loss before—
(
i
) Considering under § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(i) the partner's certified deductions and losses;
(
ii
) Determining under § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(ii) whether the 1446 tax otherwise due with respect to that partner is less than $1,000 (determined with regard to any certified deductions or losses); or
(
iii
) Considering under § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(iii) the amount of state and local taxes withheld and remitted on behalf of the partner.
(
2
) The amount of the limitation provided in § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(i)(C) shall be based on the partner's allocable share of these annualized amounts. For any installment period in which the partnership considers a partner's certificate, the partnership must also consider the following events to the extent they occur prior to the due date for paying the 1446 tax for such installment period—
(
i
) The receipt of an updated certificate or status update from the partner under § 1.1446-6(c)(2)(ii)(B) certifying an amount of deductions or losses that is less than the amount reflected on the superseded certificate (see § 1.1446-6(e)(2)
Example 4
);
(
ii
) The failure to receive an updated certificate or status update from the partner that should have been provided under § 1.1446-6(c)(2)(ii)(B); and
(
iii
) The receipt of a notification from the IRS under § 1.1446-6(c)(3) or (5) (see § 1.1446-6(e)(2)
Example 5
).
(ii)
Annualization methods.
A partnership that decides to annualize its income for the taxable year shall use one of the annualization methods set forth in section 6655(e) and the regulations thereunder, and as described in the forms and instructions for Form 8804, “Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446),” Form 8805, “Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax,” and Form 8813, “Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher.”
(iii)
Partner's estimated tax payments.
In computing its installment payments of 1446 tax, a partnership may not take into account a partner's estimated tax payments.
(iv)
Partner whose interest terminates during the partnership's taxable year.
If a partner's interest in the partnership terminates prior to the end of the partnership's taxable year, the partnership shall take into account the income that is allocable to the partner for the portion of the partnership taxable year that the person was a partner.
(v)
Exceptions and modifications to the application of the principles under section 6655.
To the extent not otherwise modified in §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7 or inconsistent with those rules, the principles of section 6655 apply to the calculation of the installment payments of 1446 tax made by a partnership as set forth in this paragraph (b)(2)(v).
(A)
Inapplicability of special rules for large corporations.
The principles of section 6655(d)(2), concerning large corporations (as defined in section 6655(g)(2)), shall not apply.
(B)
Inapplicability of special rules regarding early refunds.
The principles of section 6655(h), applicable to amounts excessively credited or refunded under section 6425, shall not apply. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section providing that section 6425 shall not apply for purposes of the 1446 tax. This paragraph (b)(2)(v)(B) shall apply to 1446 tax paid by a partnership or nominee, as well as to amounts that a partner is deemed to have paid for estimated tax purposes by reason of the partnership's or nominee's 1446 tax payments under § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(i).
(C)
Period of underpayment.
The period of the underpayment set forth in section 6655(b)(2) shall end on the earlier of the date the partnership is required to file Form 8804 (as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section and without regard to extensions), or with respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid.
(D)
Other taxes.
Section 6655 shall be applied without regard to any references to alternative minimum taxable income and modified alternative minimum taxable income.
(E)
1446 tax treated as tax under section 11.
The principles of section 6655(g)(1) shall be applied to treat the 1446 tax as a tax imposed by section 11, and any partnership required to pay such tax shall be treated as a corporation.
(F)
Application of section 6655(f).
A partnership subject to section 1446 shall apply section 6655(f) after aggregating the 1446 tax due (or any installment of such tax) for all its foreign partners. See § 1.1446-6(c)(1)(ii) for an exception to this rule when a nonresident alien partner certifies to the partnership that the partnership investment is the nonresident alien partner's only activity giving rise to effectively connected items.
(G)
Application of section 6655(i).
If a partnership has a taxable year of less than 12 months, the partnership is required to pay 1446 tax (including installments of such tax) in accordance with this section § 1.1446-3, if the partnership has ECTI allocable under section 704 to foreign partners. In such a case, the partnership shall adjust its installment payments of 1446 tax in a reasonable manner (e.g., the annualized amounts of ECTI estimated to be allocable to a foreign partner, and the section 6655(e)(2)(B)(ii) percentage to be applied to each installment) to account for the short-taxable year. However, if the partnership's taxable year is a period of less than 4 months, the partnership shall not be required to make installment payments of 1446 tax, but will only be required to file Forms 8804 and 8805 in accordance with this section § 1.1446-3, and report and pay the appropriate 1446 tax for the short-taxable year.
(H)
Current year tax safe harbor.
The safe harbor set forth in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(i) shall apply to a partnership subject to section 1446.
(I)
Prior year tax safe harbor.
The safe harbor set forth in section 6655(d)(1)(B)(ii) shall not apply and instead the safe harbor set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies.
(3)
1446 tax safe harbor
—(i)
In general.
The addition to tax under section 6655 shall not apply to a partnership with respect to a current installment of 1446 tax if—
(A) The average of the amount of the current installment and prior installments during the taxable year is at least 25 percent of the total 1446 tax (without regard to § 1.1446-6) for the prior taxable year;
(B) The prior taxable year consisted of twelve months;
(C) The partnership timely files (including extensions) an information return under section 6031 for the prior year; and
(D) The amount of ECTI for the prior taxable year is not less than 50 percent of the ECTI shown on the annual return of section 1446 withholding tax that is (or will be) timely filed for the current year.
(ii)
Permission to change to standard annualization method.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), if a partnership decides to pay its 1446 tax for the first installment period based upon the safe harbor method set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i), the partnership must use the safe harbor method for each installment payment made during the partnership's taxable year. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a partnership paying over 1446 tax during the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3) determines during an installment period (based upon the standard option annualization method set forth in section 6655(e) and the regulations thereunder, as modified by the forms and instructions to Forms 8804, 8805, and 8813) that it will not qualify for the safe harbor in this paragraph (b)(3) because the prior year's ECTI will not meet the 50-percent threshold in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(D) of this section, then the partnership is permitted, without being subject to the addition to the tax under section 6655 (as applied through this section), to pay over its 1446 tax for the period in which such determination is made, and all subsequent installment periods during the taxable year, using the standard option annualization method. A change pursuant to this paragraph shall be disclosed in a statement attached to the Form 8804 the partnership files for the taxable year and shall include information to allow the IRS to determine whether the change was appropriate.
(c)
Coordination with other withholding rules
—(1)
Fixed or determinable, annual or periodical income.
Fixed or determinable, annual or periodical income subject to tax under section 871(a) or
section 881 is not subject to withholding under section 1446, and such income is subject to the withholding requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Real property gains
—(i)
Domestic partnerships.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), a domestic partnership that is otherwise subject to the withholding requirements of sections 1445 and 1446 will be subject to the payment and reporting requirements of section 1446 only and not section 1445(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder, with respect to partnership gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest (as defined in section 897(c)). A partnership that has complied with the requirements of section 1446 will be deemed to satisfy the withholding requirements of section 1445 and the regulations thereunder. However, a domestic partnership that would otherwise be exempt from section 1445 withholding by operation of a nonrecognition provision must continue to comply with the requirements of § 1.1445-5(b)(2). In the event that amounts are withheld under section 1445(e) at the time of the disposition of a U.S. real property interest, such amounts may be credited against the partnership's 1446 tax. A partnership that fails to comply fully with the requirements of section 1446 pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2) shall be liable for any unpaid 1446 tax and subject to any applicable addition to the tax, interest, and penalties under section 1446. See § 1.1446-4(f)(4) for rules coordinating the withholding liability of publicly traded partnerships under sections 1445 and 1446.
(ii)
Foreign partnerships.
A foreign partnership that is subject to withholding under section 1445(a) during its taxable year may credit the amount withheld under section 1445(a) against its section 1446 tax liability for that taxable year only to the extent such amount is allocable to foreign partners.
(3)
Coordination with section 1443.
A partnership that has ECTI allocable under section 704 to a foreign organization described in section 501(c) shall be required to pay 1446 tax on such ECTI only to the extent such ECTI is includible under section 512 and section 513 in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income. The certificate procedure available under § 1.1441-9(b)(1) by which a partner may set forth the amounts it believes will and will not be includible in its computation of unrelated business taxable income under section 512 and section 513 shall also apply to a partner in a partnership subject to section 1446. Such certificate shall be made by a partner in the same manner as under § 1.1441-9(b)(2). A partnership that determines that the partner's certificate as to certain partnership items is unreliable or lacking must presume, consistent with § 1.1441-9(b)(3) (regarding amounts includible under section 512 in computing the organization's unrelated business taxable income), that such partnership items would be includible in computing the partner's UBTI.
(4)
Coordination with section 1446(f).
A partnership that is directly or indirectly subject to withholding under section 1446(f)(1) during its taxable year may credit the amount withheld under section 1446(f)(1) against its section 1446 tax liability for that taxable year only to the extent the amount is allocable to foreign partners.
(d)
Reporting and crediting the 1446 tax
—(1)
Reporting 1446 tax.
This paragraph (d) sets forth the rules for reporting and crediting the 1446 tax paid by a partnership. To the extent that 1446 tax is paid on ECTI allocable to a domestic trust (including a grantor or other person treated as an owner of a portion of such trust) or a grantor or other person treated as the owner of a portion of a foreign trust, the rules of this paragraph (d) applicable to a foreign trust or its beneficiaries shall be applied to such domestic or foreign trust and its beneficiaries or owners, as applicable, so that appropriate credit for the 1446 tax may be claimed by the trust, beneficiary, grantor, or other person.
(i)
Reporting of installment tax payments and notification to partners of installment tax payments.
Each partnership required to make an installment payment of 1446 tax must file Form 8813, “Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher (Section 1446),” in accordance with the instructions to that form. Form 8813 is generally used
to transmit an installment payment of 1446 tax to the IRS with respect to partnership ECTI estimated to be allocated to foreign partners. However, see § 1.1446-6(d)(3) (relating to circumstances where a partnership must file Form 8813 when no payment is required under section 1446). Except as provided in this section, a partnership must notify each foreign partner of the 1446 tax paid on the partner's behalf when the partnership makes an installment payment of 1446 tax. The notice required to be given to a foreign partner under the previous sentence must be provided within 10 days of the installment payment due date, or, if paid later, the date such installment payment is made. A foreign partner generally may credit an installment of 1446 tax paid by the partnership on the partner's behalf against the partner's estimated tax that the partner must pay during the partner's own taxable year. See § 1.1446-5(b) (relating to tiered partnership structures). However, a foreign partner may not obtain an early refund of such amounts under the estimated tax rules. See § 1.1446-3(b)(2)(v)(B). See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the amount of 1446 tax a partner may credit against its U.S. income tax liability. No particular form is required for a partnership's notification to a foreign partner, but each notification must include the partnership's name, the partnership's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), the partnership's address, the partner's name, the partner's TIN, the partner's address, the annualized ECTI estimated to be allocated to the foreign partner (or prior year's safe harbor amount, if applicable), and the amount of tax paid on behalf of the partner for both the current and any prior installment periods during the partnership's taxable year. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d), a withholding agent is not required to notify a partner of an installment of 1446 tax paid on the partner's behalf, unless requested by the partner, if—
(A) The partnership's agent responsible for providing notice pursuant to this paragraph is the same person that acts as an agent of the foreign partner for purposes of filing the partner's U.S. Federal income tax return for the partner's taxable year that includes the installment payment date; or
(B) The partnership has at least 500 foreign partners and the total 1446 tax that the partnership determines will be required to be paid for the partnership taxable year on behalf of such partner (based on paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section) with respect to the partner's allocable share of ECTI is less than $1,000.
(ii)
Payment due dates.
The 1446 tax is calculated based on partnership ECTI allocable under section 704 to foreign partners during the partnership's taxable year, as determined under section 706. Installment payments of the 1446 tax generally must be made during the partnership's taxable year in which such income is derived. A partnership must pay to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of its estimated annual 1446 tax in installments on or before the 15th day of the fourth, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months of the partnership's taxable year as provided in section 6655. Any additional amount determined to be due is to be paid with the filing of the annual return of tax required under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section and clearly designated as for the prior taxable year. Form 8813 should not be submitted for a payment made under the preceding sentence.
(iii)
Annual return and notification to partners.
Every partnership (except a publicly traded partnership subject to § 1.1446-4) that has effectively connected gross income for the partnership's taxable year allocable under section 704 to one or more of its foreign partners (or is treated as having paid 1446 tax under § 1.1446-5(b)), must file Form 8804, “Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446).” Additionally, every partnership that is required to file Form 8804 also must file Form 8805, “Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax,” for each of its foreign partners on whose behalf it paid 1446 tax, and furnish Form 8804 and the Forms 8805 to the Internal Revenue Service and the respective Form 8805 to each of its partners. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a partnership that considers a foreign partner's certificate under § 1.1446-6 when computing its 1446 tax on Form 8804 is
required to furnish such partner and the Internal Revenue Service a Form 8805, even if the form submitted to the partner shows no payment of 1446 tax on behalf of the partner. Forms 8804 and 8805 are separate from Form 1065, “U.S. Return of Partnership Income,” and the attachments thereto, and are not to be filed as part of the partnership's Form 1065. A partnership must generally file Forms 8804 and 8805 on or before the due date for filing the partnership's Form 1065. See § 1.6031(a)-1(c) for rules concerning the due date of a partnership's Form 1065. However, with respect to partnerships described in § 1.6081-5(a)(1), Forms 8804 and 8805 are not due until the 15th day of the sixth month following the close of the partnership's taxable year.
(iv)
Information provided to beneficiaries of foreign trusts and estates.
A foreign trust or estate that is a partner in a partnership subject to withholding under section 1446 shall be provided Form 8805 by the partnership. The foreign trust or estate must provide to each of its beneficiaries a copy of the Form 8805 furnished by the partnership. In addition, the foreign trust or estate must provide a statement for each of its beneficiaries to inform each beneficiary of the amount of the credit that may be claimed under section 33 (as determined under this section) for the 1446 tax paid by the partnership. Until an official Internal Revenue Service form is available, the statement from a foreign trust or estate that is described in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv) shall contain the following information—
(A) Name, address, and TIN of the foreign trust or estate;
(B) Name, address, and TIN of the partnership;
(C) The amount of the partnership's ECTI allocated to the foreign trust or estate for the partnership taxable year (as shown on the Form 8805 provided to the trust or estate);
(D) The amount of 1446 tax paid by the partnership on behalf of the foreign trust or estate (as shown on Form 8805 to the trust or estate);
(E) Name, address, and TIN of the beneficiary of the foreign trust or estate;
(F) The amount of the partnership's ECTI allocated to the trust or estate for purposes of section 1446 that is to be included in the beneficiary's gross income; and
(G) The amount of 1446 tax paid by the partnership on behalf of the foreign trust or estate that the beneficiary is entitled to claim on its return as a credit under section 33.
(v)
Attachments required of foreign trusts and estates.
The statement furnished to each foreign beneficiary under this paragraph (d)(1) must also be attached to the foreign trust or estate's U.S. Federal income tax return filed for the taxable year that includes the installment periods to which the statement relates.
(vi)
Attachments required of beneficiaries of foreign trusts and estates.
The beneficiary of the foreign trust or estate must attach the statement provided by the trust or estate pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, along with a copy of the Form 8805 furnished by the partnership to such trust or estate, to its U.S. income tax return for the year in which it claims a credit for the 1446 tax. See § 1.1446-3(d)(2)(ii) for additional rules regarding a partner or beneficial owner claiming a credit for the 1446 tax.
(vii)
Information provided to beneficiaries of foreign trusts and estates that are partners in certain publicly traded partnerships.
A statement similar to the statement required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section shall be provided by trusts or estates that hold interests in publicly traded partnerships subject to § 1.1446-4.
(2)
Crediting 1446 tax against a partner's U.S. tax liability
—(i)
In general.
A partnership's payment of 1446 tax on the portion of ECTI allocable to a foreign partner generally relates to the partner's U.S. income tax liability for the partner's taxable year in which the partner is subject to U.S. tax on that income. Subject to paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a partner may claim as a credit under section 33 the 1446 tax paid by the partnership with respect to ECTI allocable to that partner. The partner may not claim an early refund of these amounts under the estimated tax rules. See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section regarding a
partner's ability to credit an installment of 1446 tax paid on the partner's behalf against the partner's estimated tax payments due for the taxable year. See also § 1.1446-5(b) (relating to tiered partnership structures).
(ii)
Substantiation for purposes of claiming the credit under section 33.
A partner may credit the amount paid under section 1446 with respect to such partner against its U.S. income tax liability only if it attaches proof of payment to its U.S. income tax return for the partner's taxable year in which the items comprising such partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI are included in the partner's income. Except as provided in the next sentence, proof of payment consists of a copy of the Form 8805 the partnership provides to the partner (or in the case of a beneficiary of a foreign trust or estate, the statement required under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) or (vii) of this section to be provided by such trust or estate and a copy of the related Form 8805 furnished to such trust or estate), but only if the name and TIN on the Form 8805 (or the statement provided by a foreign trust or estate) match the name and TIN on the partner's U.S. tax return, and such form (or statement) identifies the partner (or beneficiary) as the person entitled to the credit under section 33. In the case of a partner of a publicly traded partnership that is subject to withholding on distributions under § 1.1446-4, proof of payment consists of a copy of the Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” provided to the partner by the partnership.
(iii)
Special rules for apportioning the tax credit under section 33
—(A)
Foreign trusts and estates.
Section 1446 tax paid on the portion of ECTI allocable under section 704 to a foreign trust or estate that the foreign trust or estate may claim as a credit under section 33 shall bear the same ratio to the total 1446 tax paid on behalf of the trust or estate as the total ECTI allocable to such trust or estate and not distributed (or treated as distributed) to the beneficiaries of such trust or estate, and, accordingly not deducted under section 651 or section 661 in calculating the trust or estate's taxable income, bears to the total ECTI allocable to such trust or estate. The 1446 tax that a foreign trust or estate is not entitled to claim as a credit under this paragraph (d)(2) may be claimed as a credit by the beneficiary of such trust or estate that includes the partnership ECTI allocated to the trust or estate in gross income under section 652 or section 662 (whether distributed or deemed to be distributed and with the same character as effectively connected income as in the hands of the trust or estate). In the case of a foreign trust or estate with multiple beneficiaries, each beneficiary may claim a portion of the 1446 tax that may be claimed by all beneficiaries under the previous sentence as a credit in the same proportion as the amount of ECTI included in such beneficiary's gross income bears to the total amount of ECTI included by all beneficiaries. The trust or estate must provide each beneficiary with a copy of the Form 8805 provided to it by the partnership and prepare the statement required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
(B)
Use of domestic trusts to circumvent section 1446.
This paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) shall apply if a partnership knows or has reason to know that a foreign person holds its interest in the partnership through a domestic trust, and such domestic trust was formed or availed of with a principal purpose of avoiding the 1446 tax. The use of a domestic trust may have a principal purpose of avoiding the 1446 tax even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together. In such case, a partnership is required to pay 1446 tax under this paragraph as if the domestic trust was a foreign trust for purposes of section 1446 and the regulations thereunder. Accordingly, all applicable additions to the tax, interest, and penalties shall apply to the partnership for its failure to pay 1446 tax under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B), commencing with the installment period during which the partnership knows or has reason to know that this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) applies. A publicly traded partnership within the meaning of § 1.1446-4 (or a nominee required to pay 1446 tax under § 1.1446-4) will not be considered to know or have reason to know a domestic trust is being used to avoid the 1446
tax under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B), provided the interest held in such entity by the domestic trust is publicly traded.
(iv)
Refunds to withholding agent.
A withholding agent (
i.e.
, the partnership) may obtain a refund of the 1446 tax paid (or deemed paid under § 1.1446-5(b)) to the extent of the excess of the amount paid to the Internal Revenue Service by the partnership, over the partnership's section 1446 tax liability as determined by the sum of the total tax creditable to each partner indicated on all Forms 8805 for the taxable year. If a partnership issues Form 8805 to a partner, then the partnership may not claim a refund for any amount of tax shown on that form as paid on behalf of the partner. If a partnership incorrectly withholds upon a United States person under section 1446 of the Internal Revenue Code and issues a Form 8805 to that person, the partnership may not file for a refund of the amount incorrectly withheld. Instead, the United States person may file for a refund of that amount on its annual return. For rules concerning refunds to withholding agents who pay 1446 tax on distributions of effectively connected income or gain under § 1.1446-4 (
i.e.
, publicly traded partnerships or nominees), see § 1.1464-1.
(v)
1446 tax treated as cash distribution to partners.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(v), a partnership's payment of 1446 tax on behalf of a foreign partner is treated under section 1446(d) and this section as a deemed distribution of money to the partner on the earliest of the day on which the partnership paid the tax, the last day of the partnership's taxable year for which the amount was paid, or the last day on which the partner owned an interest in the partnership during the taxable year for which the tax was paid. However, a deemed distribution of money under section 1446(d) resulting from a partnership's installment payment of 1446 tax on behalf of a partner is treated as an advance or drawing of money under § 1.731-1(a)(1)(ii) to the extent of the partner's distributive share of income for the partnership taxable year. The rule treating a deemed distribution as an advance or drawing of money under this paragraph (d)(2)(v) applies only for purposes of determining the tax results of the deemed distribution to the partner under sections 705, 731, and 733, and does not affect the date that the partnership is considered to have paid any installment of 1446 tax for purposes of section 6655 (as applied through this section) or the date a foreign partner is deemed to have paid estimated tax by reason of such installment payment. See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (permitting a partner to credit 1446 tax paid on the partner's behalf against the partner's estimated tax obligation). An amount treated as an advance or drawing of money is taken into account at the end of the partnership taxable year or the last day during the partnership's taxable year on which the partner owned an interest in the partnership. Any 1446 tax paid after the close of the partnership's taxable year, including amounts paid with the filing of Form 8804, that are on account of partnership ECTI allocated to partners for the prior taxable year shall be treated under section 1446(d) and this section as a distribution from the partnership on the earlier of the last day of the partnership's prior taxable year for which the tax is paid, or the last day in such prior taxable year on which such foreign partner held an interest in the partnership.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. In considering the examples, disregard the potential application of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F) of this section (relating to the
de minimis
exception to paying 1446 tax). The examples are as follows:
(A)
Example 1: Simple trust that reports entire amount of ECTI.
PRS is a partnership that has two partners, FT, a foreign trust, and A, a U.S. person. FT is a simple trust under section 651. FT and A each provide PRS with a valid Form W-8BEN and Form W-9, respectively. FT has one beneficiary, NRA, a nonresident alien. PRS and FT each maintain a calendar taxable year. PRS estimated for each installment period during the partnership's taxable year that FT would be allocated $100 of ECTI for the taxable year, and that all such ECTI would be ordinary in character. Assume that the allocation of
the $100 would be respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. PRS pays installments of 1446 tax based upon its estimates and timely pays a total of $37 of 1446 tax over the course of the partnership's taxable year ($100 ECTI × .37). Assume that PRS' estimates of ECTI allocable to FT during the taxable year equal the actual amount of ECTI allocable to FT for the taxable year. Assume also that FT's only income for the taxable year is the $100 of income from PRS, and that, pursuant to the terms of the trust's governing instrument and local law, the $100 of ECTI is not included in FT's fiduciary accounting income and the deemed distribution of the $37 withholding tax paid under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section is not included in FT's fiduciary accounting income. Accordingly, the $100 of ECTI is not income required to be distributed by FT, and FT may not claim a deduction under section 651 for this amount. FT must report the $100 of ECTI in its gross income and may claim a credit under section 33 as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section of $37 for the 1446 tax paid by PRS. NRA is not required to include any of the ECTI in gross income and accordingly may not claim a credit for any amount of the $37 of 1446 tax PRS paid.
(B)
Example 2: Simple trust that distributes a portion of ECTI to the beneficiary.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that PRS distributes $60 to FT, which FT includes in its fiduciary accounting income under local law. FT will report the $100 of ECTI in its gross income and may claim a deduction for the $60 required to be distributed under section 651(a) to NRA. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, FT may claim a $14.8 credit under section 33 for the 1446 tax PRS paid ($40/$100 multiplied by $37). NRA is required to include the $60 of the ECTI in gross income under section 652 (as ECTI) and may claim a $22.2 credit under section 33 for the 1446 tax PRS paid ($37 less $14.8 or $60/$100 multiplied by $37).
(C)
Example 3: Complex trust that distributes entire ECTI to the beneficiary.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that FT is a complex trust under section 661. PRS distributes $60 to FT, which FT includes in its fiduciary accounting income. FT distributes the $60 of fiduciary accounting income to NRA and also properly distributes an additional $40 to NRA from FT's principal. FT will report the $100 of ECTI in its gross income and may deduct the $60 required to be distributed to NRA under section 661(a)(1) and may deduct the $40 distributed to NRA under section 661(a)(2). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, FT may not claim a credit under section 33 for any of the $37 of 1446 tax paid by PRS. NRA is required to include $100 of the ECTI in gross income under section 662 (as ECTI) and may claim a $37 credit under section 33 for the 1446 tax paid by PRS ($37 less $0).
(e)
Liability of partnership for failure to withhold
—(1)
In general.
Every partnership required to pay 1446 tax is made liable for that tax by section 1461. Therefore, a partnership that is required to pay 1446 tax but fails to do so, or pays less than the amount required under this section, is liable under section 1461 for the payment of the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder unless, and to the extent, the partnership can demonstrate pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, that a foreign partner has paid the full amount of tax required to be paid by such partner to the Internal Revenue Service. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section and section 1463 regarding a partnership's liability for penalties and interest even though a foreign partner has satisfied the underlying tax liability. See also § 1.1461-3 for applicable penalties when a partnership fails to pay 1446 tax. See paragraph (b) of this section for an addition to the tax under section 6655 when there is an underpayment of 1446 tax.
(2)
Proof that tax liability has been satisfied and deemed payment of 1446 tax.
Proof of payment of tax may be established for purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section consistent with § 1.1445-1(e)(3). Under that standard, a partnership must provide sufficient information to the IRS to determine that the partner's tax liability was satisfied or
established to be zero in accordance with the rules of this section. Under this section, a partnership's liability for 1446 tax shall be deemed to have been satisfied (deemed payment), to the extent of the 1446 tax due with respect to the ECTI allocable to a foreign partner, on the later of the date that such partner is considered to have paid all tax that is required to be shown on such partner's U.S. income tax return under section 6513(a) and (b)(2) (prescribing the date tax is considered paid for purposes of sections 6511(b)(2), (c), and 6512), or the last date for payment of the 1446 tax without extensions (the unextended due date for Form 8804). The deemed payment rule of this paragraph (e)(2) shall apply for purposes sections of 1446, 1461, and 1463, and any additions to the tax, interest, or penalties potentially applicable to such partnership under section 1446, including sections 6601, 6651, and 6655. Any deemed payment of 1446 tax under this paragraph (e)(2) shall not be treated as a deemed distribution under section 1446(d) and this section.
(3)
Liability for interest, penalties, and additions to the tax
—(i)
Partnership.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a partnership that fails to pay 1446 tax is not relieved from liability under section 6655 (as applied through this section) or for interest under section 6601, when applicable. See § 1.1463-1. Such liability may exist even if there is no underlying tax liability due from a foreign partner on its allocable share of partnership ECTI. The addition to the tax under section 6655 or the interest charge under section 6601 that is required by those sections shall be imposed as set forth in those sections, as modified by this section. The section 6601 interest charge shall accrue beginning on the last date prescribed for payment of the 1446 tax due under section 1461 (which is the due date, without extensions, for filing Form 8804). The section 6601 interest charge shall stop accruing on the 1446 tax liability on the date, and to the extent, that the unpaid tax liability under section 1446 is satisfied (or is deemed satisfied under this paragraph (e)). Further, a partnership's liability under section 6655 (as applied through this section) for any underpaid installment payment shall accrue beginning on the relevant installment payment date, and shall stop accruing on the earlier of the date (and to the extent) that the 1446 tax liability is actually satisfied or the date prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) of this section. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for examples illustrating that a partner's payment of estimated tax has no effect on the partnership's calculation of its addition to the tax under section 6655 and this section. See § 1.1461-3 for a list of the additions to tax, interest, and penalties that may apply to a partnership that fails to comply with section 1446. See § 1.1446-6(d)(2)(i) for exceptions to the application of the addition to the tax under section 6655 (as applied through this section) when a partnership reasonably relies on a foreign partner's certificate to reduce 1446 tax.
(ii)
Foreign partner.
A foreign partner is permitted to reduce any addition to the tax under section 6654 or section 6655 by the amount of any section 6655 addition to the tax paid by the partnership with respect to the partnership's failure to pay adequate installment payments of the 1446 tax on ECTI allocable to the foreign partner.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. In considering the examples, disregard the potential application of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(F) of this section (relating to the
de minimis
exception to paying 1446 tax). Further, in each of the examples where a partnership is deemed to have paid 1446 tax with respect to ECTI allocable to a partner, it is assumed that the partnership has presented to the IRS the appropriate information under paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the IRS to conclude that the deemed payment is appropriate. The examples are as follows:
(i)
Example 1: Foreign partnership fails to pay 1446 tax and sole foreign partner fails to pay all tax required to be shown on partner's U.S. income tax return.
(A) PRS is a foreign partnership engaged in a trade or business in the United States and has two equal partners, A, a U.S. person, and B, a nonresident alien. PRS is described in § 1.6081-5(a) (PRS keeps its books and records outside the United States and Puerto Rico) and, therefore, is required to file Form 8804
by the 15th day of the 6th month following the close of its taxable year. Both partners and PRS are calendar year taxpayers. PRS has received a valid Form W-9 and W-8BEN from A and B, respectively, but has not received any other documents or certificates. B is engaged in multiple trades or businesses (including the PRS partnership) that give rise to effectively connected income. PRS will use an acceptable annualization method under this section for computing its 1446 tax.
(B) In PRS's first year of operations (Year 1), PRS estimates for each installment period described in § 1.1446-3 that B will be allocated $100 of ordinary ECTI for the taxable year. Therefore, for each installment period PRS is required to pay one fourth of the tax on the annualized ECTI allocable to B, or $9.25 (.25 × ($100 × .37)). PRS fails to make any installment payments. PRS's operations actually result in $100 of ECTI allocated to B. Therefore, PRS was required to have paid 1446 tax of $37 on or before the due date, without extensions, for filing its Form 8804 which is June 15, Year 2 (the last date prescribed for payment of the 1446 tax). PRS does not file Forms 8804 or 8805.
(C) B pays estimated taxes and makes the following payments on the following dates: June 15, Year 1—$20, September 15, Year 1—$15, and January 15, Year 2—$10. B's total estimated tax payments equal $45. B files its U.S. Federal income tax return timely on June 15, Year 2, and reports all effectively connected income required to be shown on its return. Assume that B's total correct tax liability as shown on the return is $50. B does not make a payment with its return and so B still owes $5 to the Internal Revenue Service (excluding any interest, penalties, and additions to the tax that may apply). Assume that B is not subject to an addition to the tax under section 6654.
(D) Under the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for purposes of sections 1446, 1461, and 1463, PRS is not considered to have paid any 1446 tax because B has not paid all of B's U.S. income tax liability.
(E) Further, under the principles of section 6655 and the rules of § 1.1446-3(e), a partner's estimated tax payments will not affect the calculation of a partnership's addition to the tax. Accordingly, PRS will be liable under the principles of section 6655 and § 1.1446-3 for failing to withhold for each installment payment. The addition to the tax will accrue beginning with the due date of each installment payment on the $9.25 underpayment for each respective installment period and will continue to accrue until June 15, Year 2 (the date prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) of this section).
(F) Further, beginning on June 15, Year 2 (the last date prescribed for payment of 1446 tax without extensions), PRS will be liable for interest under section 6601 with respect to the unpaid 1446 tax, $37. This interest will stop accruing on the earlier of the date that the 1446 tax is paid by PRS or is deemed paid under paragraph (e)(2) of this section by reason of B's payment of its full tax liability.
(G) Further, beginning on June 15, Year 2 (the due date for filing Form 8804), PRS will be liable for the addition to the tax under section 6651(a)(1) for failing to file Form 8804. This addition to the tax accrues on the amount required to be shown as the 1446 tax liability on Form 8804, $37. This addition to the tax will accrue at the rate of 5 percent per month until the date that PRS files Form 8804 for Year 1, or the maximum accrual of the penalty (25 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return) under that section has been reached.
(H) PRS may be liable for other penalties and additions to the tax for its failure to withhold or to furnish statements to its foreign partner B. See § 1.1461-3 for a list of the penalties that may apply.
(ii)
Example 2: Foreign partnership fails to pay 1446 tax but sole foreign partner pays all tax required to be shown on the partner's U.S. income tax return.
The facts are the same as paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B pays $5 with the filing of B's return and has therefore paid all tax required to be shown on B's return within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(A) For purposes of sections 1446, 1461, and 1463, PRS is deemed to have
paid its 1446 tax liability under paragraph (e)(2) of this section as of the later of the date that B is considered to have paid its tax under section 6513(a) and (b)(2) (June 15, Year 2) and the last date for PRS to pay its 1446 tax without extensions (also June 15, Year 2). Therefore, PRS is deemed to have paid all of its 1446 tax liability as of June 15, Year 2. PRS has no continuing liability for 1446 tax under section 1461, however, additions to the tax, interest, and penalties may apply.
(B) For purposes of section 6655 and § 1.1446-3, under paragraph (e)(2) PRS is deemed to have paid its 1446 tax on June 15, Year 2. Even if B had fully paid its tax liability as of March 15, Year 2, the rule in paragraph (e)(2) of this section would not deem PRS to have paid its 1446 tax until June 15, Year 2. As a result, B's estimated tax payments will have no effect on PRS's calculation of its addition to the tax. The addition to the tax under 6655 and § 1.1446-3 shall begin to accrue on each installment date with respect to the underpaid installment ($8.75), and will stop accruing on June 15, Year 2, the date prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) of this section.
(C) Because PRS is deemed to have paid its full 1446 tax liability as of June 15, Year 2 (the last date prescribed for payment of 1446 tax without extensions), PRS is not subject to an interest charge under section 6601, or a failure to file penalty under section 6651 (see section 6651(b)(1)).
(D) PRS may be liable for other penalties and additions to the tax for its failure to withhold or to furnish statements to its foreign partner B. See § 1.1461-3 for a list of the penalties that may apply.
(E) If PRS had several foreign partners, PRS would conduct the same analysis as set forth above with respect to each partner. That is, under paragraph (e) of this section, PRS may be deemed to have paid 1446 tax with respect to the ECTI allocable to some but not all of its foreign partners.
(iii)
Example 3: Domestic partnership fails to pay 1446 tax but sole foreign partner fully pays all tax required to be shown on partner's U.S. income tax return.
The facts are the same as paragraph (e)(4)(ii) introductory text of this section (
Example 2
), except that PRS is a domestic partnership whose last date prescribed for paying 1446 tax without extensions (
i.e.
, generally the unextended due date for Form 8804) is March 15, Year 2.
(A) For purposes of sections 1446, 1461, and 1463, PRS is deemed to have paid its 1446 tax liability on the later of the date that B is considered to have paid tax under section 6513(a) and (b)(2) (June 15, Year 2) and the last date for paying 1446 tax without extensions (
i.e.
, the unextended due date for Form 8804, March 15, Year 2). Accordingly, PRS is not considered to have fully paid its 1446 tax liability until June 15, Year 2. PRS has no continuing liability for 1446 tax under section 1461, however, additions to the tax, interest, and penalties may apply.
(B) For purposes of section 6655 and § 1.1446-3, PRS is subject to an underpayment addition to the tax that accrues on the same amount as in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section (
Examples 1
and
2
), respectively because PRS is not deemed to have paid 1446 tax under paragraph (e)(2) of this section until June 15, Year 2. The addition to the tax will stop accruing on the date prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) of this section (
i.e.
, March 15, Year 2, the due date, without extensions, for filing Form 8804).
(C) For purposes of section 6601, as of the last date prescribed for paying 1446 tax without extensions (March 15, Year 2), PRS has not paid or been deemed to have paid any 1446 tax. Accordingly, the interest charge under section 6601 shall begin to accrue on March 15, Year 2, and shall accrue until the 1446 liability is paid or deemed to have been paid. In this case, the interest charge will accrue until June 15, Year 2, the date that PRS is deemed to have paid its 1446 tax under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(D) For purposes of section 6651(a)(1), as of March 15, Year 2, PRS's amount required to be shown as tax on its Form 8804 is $37. This amount cannot be reduced under section 6651(b)(1) because PRS is not deemed to have paid 1446 tax under paragraph (e)(2) of this section until June 15, Year 2, a date falling after the last date for PRS to
pay its 1446 tax, March 15, Year 2. Accordingly, the failure to file penalty will begin to accrue on March 15, Year 2 (filing due date for Form 8804), and shall stop accruing on the earlier of the date that PRS files Form 8804 or the maximum accrual of the penalty (25 percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the return) is reached.
(E) PRS may be liable for other penalties and additions to the tax for its failure to withhold or to furnish statements to its foreign partner B. See § 1.1461-3 for a list of the penalties that may apply.
(f)
Effect of withholding on partner.
The payment of the 1446 tax by a partnership does not excuse a foreign partner to which a portion of ECTI is allocable from filing a U.S. tax or informational return, as appropriate, with respect to that income. Information concerning installment payments of 1446 tax paid during the partnership's taxable year on behalf of a foreign partner shall be provided to such foreign partner in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and such information may be taken into account by the foreign partner when computing the partner's estimated tax liability during the taxable year. Form 1040NR, “U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,” Form 1065, “U.S. Return of Partnership Income,” Form 1120F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation,” or such other return as appropriate, must be filed by the partner, and any tax due must be paid, by the filing deadline (including extensions) generally applicable to such person. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, a partner may generally claim a credit under section 33 for its share of any 1446 tax paid by the partnership against the amount of income tax (or 1446 tax in the case of tiers of partnerships) as computed in such partner's return. See § 1.1446-3(e)(3)(ii) for rules permitting a partner to reduce its addition to tax under section 6654 or section 6655.

§ 1.1446-4
Publicly traded partnerships.
(a)
In general.
This section sets forth rules for applying the section 1446 withholding tax (1446 tax) to publicly traded partnerships. A publicly traded partnership (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) that has effectively connected gross income, gain or loss must pay 1446 tax by withholding from distributions to a foreign partner. Publicly traded partnerships that withhold on distributions must pay over and report any 1446 tax as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and generally are not to pay over and report the 1446 tax under the rules in § 1.1446-3. The amount of the withholding tax on distributions, other than distributions excluded under paragraph (f) of this section, that are made during any partnership taxable year, equals the applicable percentage (defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) of such distributions. For penalties and additions to the tax for failure to comply with this section, see §§ 1.1461-1 and 1.1461-3.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Publicly traded partnership.
For purposes of this section, the term publicly traded partnership has the same meaning as in section 7704 (including the regulations thereunder), but does not include a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation under that section.
(2)
Applicable percentage.
For purposes of this section, applicable percentage shall have the meaning as set forth in § 1.1446-3(a)(2), except that the partnership or nominee required to pay 1446 tax may not consider a preferential rate in computing the 1446 tax due with respect to a partner.
(3)
Nominee.
For purposes of this section, the term nominee means a person that holds an interest in a publicly traded partnership on behalf of a foreign person and that is either a U.S. person, a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) that assumes primary withholding responsibility for the distribution, or a U.S. branch of a foreign person that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person (as described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)) with respect to the distribution. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a U.S. branch or a qualified intermediary is a nominee only if
it assumes primary withholding responsibility for the distribution for all purposes of chapters 3 and 4 of subtitle A of the Code.
(4)
Qualified notice.
For purposes of this section, a qualified notice is a notice from a publicly traded partnership that states the amount of a distribution that is attributable to each type of income described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (v) of this section. A qualified notice may also include the information described in § 1.1446(f)-4(b)(3) (relating to the 10-percent exception to withholding under section 1446(f)(1)) and the information described in § 1.1446(f)-4(c)(2)(iii) (relating to an adjustment to the amount realized for withholding under section 1446(f)(1)). The notice must be posted in a readily accessible format in an area of the primary public website of the publicly traded partnership that is dedicated to this purpose, and a copy of the notice must be delivered to any registered holder that is a nominee. A qualified notice must be posted and delivered to the registered holder by the date required for providing notice with respect to distributions described in 17 CFR 240.10b-17(b)(1) or (3) issued pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a) and contain the information described therein as it would relate to the distribution. The publicly traded partnership must keep the notice accessible to the public for ten years on its primary public website or the primary public website of any successor organization. No specific format is required unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner in forms or instructions or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter). See paragraph (d) of this section regarding when a nominee is considered to have received a qualified notice.
(c)
Paying and reporting 1446 tax.
The withholding tax required under this section is to be paid pursuant to the rules and procedures of section 1461, §§ 1.1461-1, 1.1461-2, and 1.6302-2, as supplemented by the rules of this section. A withholding agent under this section must use Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” and Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” to report withholding from distributions under this section. See § 1.1461-1(b). Further, a withholding agent under this section may obtain a refund for 1446 tax paid in accordance with section 1464 and the regulations thereunder. See § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(iv) and (vii) (relating to a foreign trust or estate that holds an interest in a publicly traded partnership) and § 1.1446-5(d) (relating to a publicly traded partnership that is part of a tiered partnership structure) for additional guidance.
(d)
Rules for nominees required to withhold tax under section 1446
—(1)
In general.
A nominee that receives a distribution from a publicly traded partnership (or another nominee) that is to be paid to (or for the account of) any foreign person is treated as a withholding agent under this section. A nominee that fails to withhold pursuant to this section is subject to liability under section 1461, as well as applicable penalties and interest, as if the nominee were the partnership responsible for withholding. A nominee that receives a qualified notice that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(4) of this section must withhold based on the amounts specified on the qualified notice. A nominee is treated as receiving a qualified notice on the date that the notice is posted to the publicly traded partnership's website or is received by the nominee in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If a nominee properly withholds based on the amounts specified on a qualified notice, the nominee is not liable for any underwithholding on amounts that are effectively connected income, gain, or loss. Rather, the publicly traded partnership that issued the qualified notice is liable under section 1461 for underwithholding on such amounts. If a nominee does not receive a qualified notice that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or to the extent the qualified notice does not specify an amount, the nominee must withhold on the full amount of the distribution with respect to—
(i) A foreign partner that is a corporation, at the greater of the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) or 881 (without regard to any reduction in
the rate of tax permitted under an applicable income tax treaty);
(ii) A foreign partner that is not a corporation, at the greater of the highest rate of tax specified in section 1 or 871 (without regard to any reduction in the rate of tax permitted under an applicable income tax treaty); or
(iii) A foreign partner whose classification cannot be determined, at the higher of the rate determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2)
Exception to nominee's withholding.
A nominee is not required to withhold under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the extent that it makes a payment of a distribution to a qualified intermediary or U.S. branch that is also a nominee for the distribution under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a nominee may treat a qualified intermediary or U.S. branch as a nominee for a distribution based on, respectively, a valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or a valid U.S. branch withholding certificate described in § 1.1446(f)-4(a)(2)(ii)(B) on which the qualified intermediary or U.S. branch represents that it assumes primary withholding responsibility with respect to the distribution.
(e)
Determining foreign status of partners.
Except as provided in this paragraph (e), the rules of § 1.1446-1 shall apply in determining whether a partner of a publicly traded partnership is a foreign partner for purposes of the 1446 tax. A partnership or nominee obligated to withhold under this section shall be entitled to rely on any of the forms acceptable under § 1.1446-1 that it receives from persons on whose behalf it holds interests in the partnership to the same extent a partnership is entitled to rely on such forms under those rules. If a partnership or nominee pays a distribution to an entity that provides a valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) indicating that the entity does not assume primary withholding responsibility for the distribution, for withholding under this section the partnership or nominee may instead rely on a withholding statement that allocates the distribution to—
(1) A chapter 3 withholding rate pool (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)) consisting of account holders that are foreign persons subject to withholding at the highest rate of tax specified in section 1;
(2) A chapter 3 withholding rate pool (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)) consisting of account holders that are foreign persons subject to withholding at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b);
(3) A chapter 3 withholding rate pool (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)) consisting of account holders that are foreign persons not subject to withholding; or
(4) Each account holder for which a form acceptable under § 1.1446-1 is provided.
(f)
Distributions subject to withholding
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (f)(1), a publicly traded partnership must withhold at the applicable percentage with respect to any actual distribution made to a foreign partner. The amount of a distribution subject to 1446 tax includes the amount of any 1446 tax required to be withheld on the distribution. In the case of a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that receives a partnership distribution from another partnership in which it is a partner (lower-tier partnership) (
i.e.
, a tiered structure described in § 1.1446-5), any 1446 tax that was paid by the lower-tier partnership may be credited by the upper-tier partnership and shall be treated as a distribution under section 1446. For example, a foreign publicly traded partnership, UTP, owns an interest in domestic publicly traded partnership, LTP. LTP makes a distribution subject to section 1446 of $100 to UTP during its taxable year beginning January 1, 2020, and withholds 37 percent (the highest rate in section 1) ($37) of that distribution under section 1446. UTP receives a net distribution of $63 which it immediately redistributes to its partners. UTP has a liability to pay 37 percent of the total actual and deemed distribution it makes to its foreign partners as a section 1446 withholding tax. UTP may credit the $37 withheld by LTP against this liability as if it were paid by UTP. See §§ 1.1462-
1(b) and 1.1446-5(b)(1). When UTP distributes the $63 it actually receives from LTP to its partners, UTP is treated for purposes of section 1446 as if it made a distribution of $100 to its partners ($63 actual distribution and $37 deemed distribution). UTP's partners (U.S. and foreign) may claim a credit against their U.S. income tax liability for their allocable share of the $37 of 1446 tax paid on their behalf.
(2)
In-kind distributions.
If a publicly traded partnership distributes property other than money, the partnership shall not release the property until it has funds sufficient to enable the partnership to pay over in money the required 1446 tax.
(3)
Ordering rule relating to distributions.
Distributions from publicly traded partnerships are deemed to be paid out of the following types of income in the order indicated—
(i) Amounts attributable to income described in section 1441 or 1442 that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and are subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a);
(ii) Amounts attributable to income described in section 1441 or 1442 that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and are not subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a);
(iii) Amounts attributable to income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States that are not subject to withholding under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6;
(iv) Amounts subject to withholding under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6; and
(v) Amounts not listed in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(4)
Coordination with section 1445(e)(1).
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a publicly traded partnership that complies with the requirements of withholding under section 1446 and this section will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of section 1445(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the excluded amounts set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, distributions subject to withholding at the applicable percentage shall include the following—
(i) Amounts subject to withholding under section 1445(e)(1) upon distribution pursuant to an election under § 1.1445-5(c)(3) of the regulations; and
(ii) Amounts not subject to withholding under section 1445 because the distributee is a partnership or is a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i).
[T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28717, May 18, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76934, Nov. 30, 2020; 86 FR 13191, Mar. 8, 2021]
§ 1.1446-5
Tiered partnership structures.
(a)
In general.
The rules of this section shall apply in cases where a partnership (lower-tier partnership) that has effectively connected taxable income (ECTI), has a partner that is a partnership (upper-tier partnership). Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if an upper-tier domestic partnership directly owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership, the lower-tier partnership is not required to pay the section 1446 withholding tax (1446 tax) with respect to the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of net income, regardless of whether the upper-tier domestic partnership's partners are foreign. Paragraph (b) of this section prescribes the reporting requirements for upper-tier and lower-tier partnerships subject to section 1446. Paragraph (c) of this section prescribes rules requiring a lower-tier partnership to look through an upper-tier foreign partnership to a partner of such upper-tier partnership to the extent it has sufficient documentation to determine the status of such partner and determine such partner's indirect share of the lower-tier partnership's effectively connected taxable income (ECTI). Paragraph (d) of this section prescribes rules applicable to a publicly traded partnership in a tiered partnership structure. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes rules permitting a domestic upper-tier partnership to elect to apply the look through rules of paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth examples illustrating the rules of this section.
(b)
Reporting requirements
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that an upper-tier partnership that is a foreign
partnership is a partner in a lower-tier partnership, and the lower-tier partnership has paid 1446 tax (including installment payments of such tax) with respect to ECTI allocable to the upper-tier partnership, the lower-tier partnership shall comply with §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-3 and provide the upper-tier partnership notice of such payments and a copy of the statements and forms filed with respect to the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership (e.g., Form 8805, “Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax”). The upper-tier partnership may treat the 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) paid by the lower-tier partnership on its behalf as a credit against its liability to pay 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax), as if the upper-tier partnership actually paid over the amounts at the time that the amounts were paid by the lower-tier partnership. See § 1.1462-1(b) and § 1.1446-3(d). To the extent required in § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(iii), the upper-tier partnership will file Form 8804, “Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446),” and Form 8805, “Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax,” for each of its foreign partners with respect to its 1446 tax obligation. To the extent the upper-tier partnership does not claim a refund of the 1446 tax it paid (or is considered to have paid), the upper-tier partnership will pass the credit for the 1446 tax paid to its partners on the Forms 8805 it issues. See § 1.1446-3(d). The rules of this paragraph (b) shall apply to an upper-tier and lower-tier partnership to the extent that an election has been made and consented to under paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Publicly traded partnerships.
In the case of an upper-tier foreign partnership that is a publicly traded partnership, the rules of § 1.1446-4(c) shall apply. See also paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Look through rules for foreign upper-tier partnerships.
For purposes of computing the 1446 tax obligation of a lower-tier partnership, if an upper-tier foreign partnership owns an interest in the lower-tier partnership, the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of ECTI from the lower-tier partnership shall be treated as allocable to a partner of the upper-tier partnership, to the extent of such partner's indirect share of such ECTI (as if such partner were a direct partner in the lower-tier partnership), if—
(1) The upper-tier foreign partnership furnishes the lower-tier partnership a valid Form W-8IMY, “Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Flow Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding,” indicating that it is a look-through foreign partnership for purposes of section 1446; and
(2) The lower-tier partnership can reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) effectively connected partnership items allocable to the upper-tier partnership (and indirectly to such partner) with a Form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN), Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” or other form acceptable under § 1.1446-1, establishing the status of such partner provided by the upper-tier partnership. The lower-tier partnership required to pay 1446 tax must be able to provide the information necessary for the IRS to determine the chain of ownership, allocation of effectively connected items at each partnership level, as well as to the ultimate beneficial owner of the effectively connected items, and whether the amount of 1446 tax paid was appropriate. This information should permit each partnership in the tiered structure and the IRS to reliably associate any effectively connected items allocable to such upper-tier partnership, as well as to the ultimate beneficial owner of the effectively connected items. The principles of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) shall apply to determine whether a lower-tier partnership can reliably associate effectively connected partnership items allocable to the upper-tier partnership with a partner of the upper-tier partnership. To the extent the lower-tier partnership receives a valid Form W-8IMY from the upper-tier partnership but cannot reliably associate a portion of the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of effectively connected partnership items with a partner of such upper-tier partnership, then the lower-tier partnership shall pay 1446 tax on such portion
at the higher of the applicable percentages in section 1446(b). See § 1.1446-3(a)(2) for the treatment of any income or gain potentially subject to a preferential rate. If a lower-tier partnership has not received a valid Form W-8IMY from the upper-tier partnership, the lower-tier partnership shall withhold on the upper-tier partnership's entire allocable share of ECTI at the higher of the applicable percentages in section 1446(b). The look through regime set forth in this paragraph (c) is for purposes of computing the lower-tier partnership's 1446 tax obligation only and does not alter the persons considered to be partners in the lower-tier partnership for partnership reporting purposes (e.g., issuing Form 8805, Schedule K-1).
(d)
Publicly traded partnerships
—(1)
Upper-tier publicly traded partnership.
The rules set forth in paragraph (c) shall not apply to look through an upper-tier partnership whose interests are publicly traded (as defined in § 1.1446-4(b)(1)).
(2)
Lower-tier publicly traded partnership.
The look through rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply, if the requirements of that paragraph are met, to a lower-tier partnership that is a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of § 1.1446-4(b)(1) only if the upper-tier partnership is not described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For example, a lower-tier publicly traded partnership (or nominee) shall look through an upper-tier foreign partnership (or domestic partnership to the extent an election is made and consented to under paragraph (e) of this section) when computing its 1446 tax liability, provided the upper-tier partnership is not a publicly traded partnership and the appropriate documentation needed to satisfy the standards set forth in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and paragraph (c) of this section have been furnished.
(e)
Election by a domestic upper-tier partnership to apply look through rules
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the rules of this paragraph (e), a domestic partnership that is a partner in a lower-tier partnership may elect to apply the rules of this section 1.1446-5 and have the lower-tier partnership look through such upper-tier partnership to the partners of such domestic partnership for purposes of computing the lower-tier partnership's 1446 tax liability. A domestic partnership shall make this election by attaching to the Form W-9 submitted to the lower-tier partnership, a written statement and information (described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) that identifies the upper-tier partnership as a domestic partnership and that states that such partnership is making the election under this paragraph (e). This paragraph (e)(1) shall not apply to a publicly traded partnership described in § 1.1446-4(b)(1). See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(2)
Information required for valid election statement.
In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, the election statement submitted under this paragraph (e)(2) is not valid and cannot be accepted by the lower-tier partnership pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section unless the upper-tier partnership attaches valid documentation pursuant to § 1.1446-1 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) with respect to one or more of its foreign partners. The information and documentation submitted with the election must comply with the rules of this section to permit the lower-tier partnership to reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) at least a portion of the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of ECTI with one or more foreign partners of the upper-tier partnership. The election statement must identify the upper-tier partnership by name, address, and TIN, and specify the percentage interest the domestic partnership holds in the lower-tier partnership. The statement may also include such information the upper-tier partnership deems necessary to enable the lower-tier partnership to apply the provisions of this section. If at any time the upper-tier partnership determines that the information or documentation previously provided to the lower-tier partnership is no longer correct, the upper-tier partnership shall update such information and documentation. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an election that is effective under this paragraph (e) shall apply for subsequent taxable years until such upper-tier partnership revokes the election in writing. A revocation under
this section shall be effective for any installment due date arising more than 15 days subsequent to the date that the lower-tier partnership receives such revocation.
(3)
Consent of lower-tier partnership.
An election made under this paragraph (e) is not effective until the lower-tier partnership consents in writing to the upper-tier partnership that it agrees to apply the provisions of this section. A lower-tier partnership may not consent to an election submitted under this paragraph (e) for any installment date or Form 8804 filing date arising within 15 days of the lower-tier partnership's receipt of such election. The lower-tier partnership's written consent must specify the extent to which it will look through the upper-tier partnership in computing its 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax). To the extent that the lower-tier partnership does not consent to an election to apply the look through provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the lower-tier partnership shall consider such portion of the upper-tier partnership's allocable share of ECTI as allocable to a domestic person for purposes of computing its 1446 tax obligation. A lower-tier partnership that has consented to an election under this paragraph (e) may revoke or modify its consent, in writing, at any time.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In considering the examples, disregard the potential application of § 1.l446-3(b)(2)(v)(F) (relating to the
de minimis
exception to paying 1446 tax). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Sufficient documentation—tiered partnership structure.
(i) Nonresident alien (NRA) and foreign corporation (FC) are partners in PRS, a foreign partnership, and share profits and losses in PRS 70 and 30 percent, respectively. All of PRS's partnership items are allocated based upon each partner's respective ownership interest and it is assumed that these allocations are respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. NRA and FC each furnish PRS with a valid Form W-8BEN establishing themselves as a foreign individual and foreign corporation, respectively. PRS holds a 40 percent interest in the profits, losses and capital of LTP, a lower-tier partnership. NRA holds the remaining 60 percent interest in profits, losses and capital of LTP. All of LTP's partnership items are allocated based upon each partner's respective ownership interest and it is assumed that these allocations are respected under section 704(b) and the regulations thereunder. LTP has $100 of annualized ECTI for the relevant installment period. All of this income is ordinary income and there is no potential application of a preferential rate applicable percentage under § 1.1446-3(a)(2). Further, § 1.1446-6 does not apply. PRS has no income other than the income allocated from LTP. PRS provides LTP with a valid Form W-8IMY indicating that it is a foreign partnership and attaches the valid Form W-8BENs executed by NRA and FC, as well as a statement describing the allocation of PRS's effectively connected items among its partners. The information that PRS submits to LTP is sufficient to permit LTP to reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) PRS's allocable share of effectively connected items with NRA and FC pursuant to this section. Further, NRA provides a valid Form W-8BEN to LTP.
(ii) LTP must pay 1446 tax on the $60 allocable to its direct partner NRA using the applicable percentage for non-corporate partners (the highest rate in section 1).
(iii) With respect to the effectively connected partnership items that LTP can reliably associate with NRA through PRS (70 percent of PRS's 40 percent allocable share ($40), or $28), LTP will pay 1446 tax on NRA's allocable share of LTP's ECTI (as determined by looking through PRS) using the applicable percentage for non-corporate partners (the highest rate in section 1).
(iv) With respect to the effectively connected partnership items that LTP can reliably associate with FC through PRS (30 percent of PRS's 40 percent allocable share ($40), or $12), LTP will pay 1446 tax on FC's allocable share of LTP's ECTI (as determined by looking through PRS) using the applicable percentage for corporate partners (the highest rate in section 11).
(v) LTP's payment of the 1446 tax is treated as a distribution to NRA and PRS, its direct partners, that those partners may credit against their respective tax obligations. PRS will report its 1446 tax obligation with respect to its direct foreign partners, NRA and FC, on the Form 8804 and Forms 8805 that it files with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and will credit the amount withheld by LTP on its Form 8804. This credit will satisfy PRS's 1446 tax liability as reported on the Form 8804 it files because PRS's only income is from LTP, and LTP paid 1446 tax with respect to all of PRS's allocable share in LTP by looking through to PRS's partners NRA and FC. Further, PRS will pass along the credit for the 1446 tax withheld by LTP to its partners, NRA and FC on the Form 8805 issued to each partner. The credit passed to each partner on Form 8805 will be treated as
a distribution to the respective partners under section 1446(d).

# Example 2. Insufficient documentation—tiered partnership structure.
(i) LTP is a domestic partnership that has two equal partners A and PRS. A is a nonresident alien and PRS is a foreign partnership that has two equal foreign partners, C and D. Neither A nor PRS provides LTP with a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9. Neither C nor D provides PRS with a valid Form W-8 or Form W-9. Pursuant to § 1.1446-1(c)(3), LTP must presume that PRS is a foreign person subject to withholding under section 1446 at the higher of the highest rate under section 1 or section 11(b)(1). LTP has also not received any documentation with respect to A. LTP must presume that A is a foreign person, and, if LTP knows that A is an individual, compute and pay 1446 tax, subject to § 1.1446-3(a)(2), based on that knowledge.
(ii) Assume a change of facts where C provides a form W-8 (e.g., Form W-8BEN) to PRS, and PRS in turn, furnishes that form to LTP along with its Form W-8IMY, and information regarding how effectively connected items are allocated to C and D. Based upon the additional facts, LTP can reliably associate one-half of PRS's allocable share of ECTI with documentation related with C. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, LTP will look through PRS to C when computing its 1446 tax to the extent of C's indirect share and will not look through with respect to the remainder of PRS's allocable share (D's indirect share).
[T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28717, May 18, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9394, 73 FR 23074, Apr. 29, 2008]
§ 1.1446-6
Special rules to reduce a partnership's 1446 tax with respect to a foreign partner's allocable share of effectively connected taxable income.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides rules regarding when a partnership required to pay withholding tax under section 1446 (1446 tax), or an installment of 1446 tax, may consider certain partner-level deductions and losses in computing its 1446 tax obligation under § 1.1446-3, or otherwise not pay a de minimis amount of 1446 tax due with respect to a nonresident alien individual partner. A partnership determines the applicability of the rules of this section on a partner-by-partner basis for each installment period and when completing its Form 8804, “Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax (Section 1446),” and paying 1446 tax for the partnership taxable year. Except with respect to certain state and local taxes paid by the partnership on behalf of the partner, to apply the rules of this section with respect to a foreign partner, the partnership must receive a certificate from such partner for each partnership taxable year. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies the foreign partners to which this section applies. Paragraph (c) of this section identifies the deductions and losses that a foreign partner may certify to the partnership as well as the state and local taxes paid by the partnership on behalf of the foreign partner that can be taken into account without a certification, and establishes an exception that permits a partnership to not pay a de minimis amount of 1446 tax with respect to a nonresident alien partner. Paragraph (c) of this section also sets forth the requirements for a valid certificate. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (d) of this section establish when a partnership may rely on and consider a foreign partner's certificate in computing its 1446 tax, and the effects of relying on such a certificate. Paragraph (d) of this section also describes the effects of a partnership relying on a certificate (including an updated certificate) and the reporting requirements of a partnership with respect to a certificate. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth examples that illustrate the rules of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides the Effective/Applicability date. Paragraph (g) of this section provides a transition rule.
(2)
Reasonable reliance on a certificate.
Subject to § 1.1446-2 and the rules of this section, a partnership receiving a certificate (including an updated certificate or status update under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) of deductions and losses from a partner provided in accordance with the provisions of this section may reasonably rely on such certificate (to the extent of the certified deductions and losses or other representations set forth in the certificate) until such time that it has actual knowledge or reason to know that the certificate is defective or that the time
for receiving an updated certificate or status update from the partner under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section has expired. For this purpose, a partnership shall be considered to have actual knowledge or reason to know that a certificate is defective upon receipt of written notification from the IRS under paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(5) of this section.
(b)
Foreign partner to whom this section applies
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a foreign partner to whom this section applies is a foreign partner that meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(1).
(i) The partner has provided valid documentation to the partnership to which a certificate is submitted under this section in accordance with § 1.1446-1.
(ii) If the partner's current taxable year is the first taxable year in which the partner submits a certificate to any partnership, the partner has filed (or will file) a qualifying U.S. income tax return for each of its three taxable years ending before the end of the partnership's taxable year for which the partner is submitting a certificate (regardless of whether it was a partner in that partnership during each of these years). A qualifying U.S. income tax return for a taxable year that is prior to the first taxable year the partner submits a certificate to any partnership is a U.S. income tax return filed within the time specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii) If the current taxable year of the partner is not the first taxable year in which the partner submits a certificate to any partnership, the partner met the requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for the first taxable year in which it submitted a certificate to any partnership and has filed (or will file) a qualifying U.S. income tax return for its first taxable year in which it submitted a certificate to any partnership and each subsequent taxable year ending before the beginning of the current taxable year (regardless of whether it was a partner in any partnership during each of those years). A qualifying U.S. income tax return for a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year the partner submits a certificate to any partnership is a U.S. income tax return filed within the time specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iv) The partner files a qualifying U.S. income tax return (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) for its taxable year in which a certificate is provided to any partnership.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
U.S. income tax return.
A U.S. income tax return means a Form 1040NR, “U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,” in the case of a nonresident alien individual and a Form 1120F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation,” in the case of a foreign corporation.
(ii)
Timely-filed.
Only for purposes of this section, a U.S. income tax return shall be considered timely-filed if the return is filed on or before the due date set forth in section 6072(c), plus any extension of time to file such return granted under section 6081.
(iii)
Qualifying U.S. income tax return.
A U.S. income tax return shall constitute a qualifying U.S. income tax return if the return reports income or gain that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities and if the return is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section. A protective return described in § 1.874-1(b)(6) or § 1.882-4(a)(3)(vi) is not a qualifying U.S. income tax return for purposes of this section.
(A) A U.S. income tax return for a partner's preceding taxable year in which it did not submit a certificate to any partnership (but not including a taxable year following the first taxable year in which the partner submitted a certificate to any partnership), with a due date as set forth in section 6072(c), not including any extensions of time to file, which falls before the beginning of the current partnership taxable year for which the certificate is provided is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) if the return is filed and all amounts due with respect to such return (including interest, penalties, and additions to tax, if any) are paid on or before the earlier of—
(
1
) The date that is one year after the due date set forth in section 6072(c) for
such return, not including any extensions of time to file; or
(
2
) The date on which the certificate for the current partnership taxable year is submitted to the partnership.
(B) A U.S. income tax return for a partner's preceding taxable year in which it did not submit a certificate to any partnership (but not including a taxable year following the first taxable year in which the partner submitted a certificate to any partnership), with a due date as set forth in section 6072(c), not including any extensions of time to file, which falls within the current partnership taxable year for which the certificate is provided is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) if the return is timely-filed and all amounts due with respect to such return are timely paid.
(C) A U.S. income tax return for a taxable year in which the partner submits a certificate to any partnership and for a taxable year following the first taxable year in which the partner submits a certificate to any partnership is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) if the return is timely-filed and all amounts due with such return are timely paid with respect to such return.
(3)
Special rules
—(i) In the case of a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that is a partner in another partnership (lower-tier partnership)—
(A) The rules of this section may apply to reduce or eliminate the 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) of the lower-tier partnership with respect to a foreign partner of the upper-tier partnership only to the extent the provisions of § 1.1446-5 apply to look through the upper-tier partnership to the foreign partner of such upper-tier partnership and the certificate described in paragraph (c) of this section is provided by such foreign partner to the upper-tier partnership and, in turn, provided to the lower-tier partnership with other appropriate documentation (see § 1.1446-5(c) and (e));
(B) An upper-tier partnership that submits a certificate of deductions and losses or a de minimis certificate to a lower-tier partnership may not submit that certificate to another lower-tier partnership;
(C) An upper-tier partnership that relies on a certificate submitted to it by a foreign partner under this section for computing its 1446 tax due on effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to that partner (other than ECTI allocable to it from a lower-tier partnership) may not submit that certificate to any lower-tier partnership; and
(D) In addition to any other information required by this section, a lower-tier partnership must submit with a Form 8813, “Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher (Section 1446),” and Form 8805, “Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax,” for which it relies on a certificate from an upper-tier partnership to reduce the 1446 tax due with respect to a foreign partner of the upper-tier partnership, sufficient information so that the IRS may reliably associate the ECTI and the certificate of deductions and losses with the partner in the upper-tier partnership submitting the certificate, including the name, taxpayer identification number (TIN) and allocation of effectively connected items at each partnership tier, as well as to the ultimate upper-tier partner submitting the certificate.
(ii) This section shall not apply to a partner that is a foreign estate or its beneficiaries.
(iii) This section shall not apply to a partner that is a trust or to its beneficiaries, except to the extent that such trust is owned by a grantor or other person under subpart E of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code, the documentation requirements of § 1.1446-1 have been met by the grantor or other owner of such trust, and the certificate described in paragraph (c) of this section is provided by the grantor or other owner of such trust to the partnership.
(iv) This section shall not apply to a partner in a publicly-traded partnership subject to § 1.1446-4.
(c)
Reduction of 1446 tax with respect to a foreign partner
—(1)
General rules.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section a foreign partner to whom this section applies may certify to a partnership for a partnership taxable year that it has certain deductions (other than charitable deductions) and losses properly
allocated and apportioned to gross income that is effectively connected (or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of the partner's trade or business in the United States, and that the partner reasonably expects those deductions and losses to be available and claimed on the partner's U.S. income tax return to be filed for that taxable year. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a nonresident alien individual partner to whom this section applies may also certify to a partnership for a partnership taxable year that its only investment or activity giving rise to effectively connected items for the partnership's taxable year that ends with or within the partner's taxable year is (and will be) the partner's investment in the partnership. A certificate submitted by a foreign partner to a partnership under this section must be in accordance with the form and requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a partnership may take into account certain state and local taxes withheld by the partnership on behalf of the partner.
(i)
Certified deductions and losses
—(A)
Deductions and losses from the partnership.
Under this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A), a partner may certify to a partnership for a partnership taxable year deductions (other than charitable deductions) and losses properly allocated and apportioned to gross income which is effectively connected (or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of the partner's trade or business in the United States, that are reported on a Form 1065 (Schedule K-1), “Partner's Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.,” issued (or to be issued) to the partner by the partnership for a prior partnership taxable year, that are (or will be) reported on a qualifying U.S. income tax return for a partner's taxable year that ends before the installment due date or the close of the partnership taxable year for which the partner is certifying such deductions and losses, and that the partner reasonably expects to be available and claimed on a qualifying U.S. income tax return for the partner's taxable year ending with or after the close of the partnership taxable year. A partner that has a loss reported on a Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) issued (or to be issued) to the partner by the partnership for a prior partnership taxable year, but that is not (and will not be) reported on a qualifying U.S. income tax return for a prior taxable year of the partner because the loss is suspended under section 704(d) may also certify such suspended loss to the partnership under this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A).
(B)
Deductions and losses from other sources.
Under this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B), a foreign partner may certify to a partnership for a partnership taxable year deductions (other than charitable deductions) and losses properly allocated and apportioned to gross income that is effectively connected (or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of the partner's trade or business in the United States and that are from sources other than the partnership to whom the certificate is submitted if the deductions and losses are (or will be) reported on a qualifying U.S. income tax return of the partner for a taxable year that ends before the installment due date or the close of the partnership taxable year for which the partner is certifying the deductions and losses and the partner reasonably expects the deductions and losses to be available and claimed on the qualifying U.S. income tax return filed for its taxable year ending with or after the close of the partnership taxable year. Any deductions and losses certified under this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) that are allocated to the partner from another partnership must be reported on a Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) issued (or to be issued) to the partner by such other partnership. However, the partner may not certify any deduction or loss allocated to it from another partnership that is suspended under section 704(d).
(C)
Limit on the consideration of a partner's net operating loss deduction.
A partnership may not consider a net operating loss deduction (as determined under section 172) certified by the partner under this paragraph (c)(1)(i) in an amount greater than the percentage limitation, if any, provided in section 56(a)(4) and (d) multiplied by the partner's allocable share of ECTI from the partnership reduced by all other certified deductions and losses whether or
not taken into account by the partnership, as well as deductions considered under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(D)
Limitation on losses subject to certain partner level limitations.
Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a partner must identify any certified losses or deductions that are subject to special limitations at the partner level (for example, sections 465 and 469) and provide information to the partnership that will allow the partnership to take the special limitations into account. For example, where a partner certifies a loss to the partnership that is a passive activity loss under section 469, the partner shall identify the activities the partnership conducts that the partner expects will be passive activities. The partnership shall then ensure that these limitations are taken into account when determining the 1446 tax due with respect to the partner.
(E)
Certification of deductions and losses to other partnerships.
Deductions and losses certified to a partnership for a taxable year of the partnership may not be certified for the taxable year of another partnership that begins or ends with or within the taxable year of the partnership to which the deductions and losses were certified.
(F)
Partner level use of deductions and losses certified to a partnership.
Any deductions and losses certified to a partnership for a taxable year of the partner and considered by the partnership in computing its section 1446 tax due may not be considered by that partner for the same taxable year in computing the amount of its required installments under section 6654(d) or 6655(d) on income unrelated to the partnership to which the partner has submitted the certificate.
(ii)
De minimis certificate for nonresident alien individual partners
—(A)
In general.
Under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), a nonresident alien individual partner to whom this section applies and that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section may certify to a partnership that its only activity giving rise to effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss for the partnership's taxable year that ends with or within the partner's taxable year is (and will be) the partner's investment in the partnership. A partnership that receives a certificate from a nonresident alien partner under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) and that may reasonably rely on such certificate is not required to pay 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) with respect to such partner if the partnership estimates that the annualized (or, in the case of a partnership completing its Form 8804, the actual) 1446 tax otherwise due with respect to such partner is less than $1,000, without taking into account any deductions or losses certified by the partner to the partnership under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or any amounts under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Requirements for exception.
The requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) are met if the nonresident individual alien partner's only activity giving rise to effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss for the partnership taxable year that ends with or within the partner's taxable year is (and will be) the partner's investment in the partnership. For this purpose, if the partner has (or has reason to expect to have) income or gain described in section 864(c)(6), such income or gain shall be considered derived from a separate investment activity. A certificate submitted by a nonresident alien individual partner under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is valid even if such certificate does not certify deductions and losses to partnership under this section. A nonresident alien individual partner that submits a certificate to a partnership under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) must notify the partnership in writing and revoke such certificate within 10 days of the date that the partner invests or otherwise engages in another activity that may give rise to effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss for the partner's taxable year. For example, while an investment in a U.S. real property interest (as defined in section 897(c)) would not give rise to an activity requiring a notification (unless an election is in effect under section 871(d)), the disposition of the U.S. real property interest would give rise to an activity requiring a notification.
(iii)
Consideration of certain current year state and local taxes.
In addition to
any deductions and losses certified by a foreign partner to a partnership under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the partnership may consider as a deduction of such partner 90-percent of any state and local income taxes withheld and remitted by the partnership on behalf of such partner with respect to the partner's allocable share of partnership ECTI. The partnership may consider the amount of state and local taxes of the foreign partner determined under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii) regardless of whether the foreign partner submits a certificate to the partnership under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2)
Form and time of certification
—(i)
Form of certification.
A partner's certification to a partnership under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section shall be made using Form 8804-C, “Certificate Of Partner-Level Items to Reduce Section 1446 Withholding” in accordance with the instructions of the form and the rules of this section.
(ii)
Time for certification provided to partnership
—(A)
First certificate submitted for a partnership's taxable year.
Provided the other requirements of this section are met, a partnership may only rely on the first certificate received from a foreign partner for any 1446 tax installment due or Form 8804 filing due (without regard to extensions) on or after the date on which the certificate is received. See § 1.1446-3 for 1446 tax installment due dates. See also paragraph (e) of this section for examples illustrating the rules of this paragraph (c)(2).
(B)
Updated certificates and status updates
—(
1
)
Preceding year tax returns not yet filed.
If a foreign partner's U.S. income tax return for a preceding taxable year has not been filed as of the time the partner submits to the partnership its first certificate under this paragraph (c), the certificate shall specify this fact and set forth the filing due date for such return set forth in section 6072(c), plus any extension of time to file such return granted under section 6081 and the regulations under section 6081. The partner shall also submit an updated certificate to the partnership in accordance with this paragraph (c) within 10 days of the date the partner files its U.S. income tax return for any such taxable year. In addition, prior to the partnership's final 1446 tax installment due date the partner shall provide to the partnership, under penalties of perjury, a status update regarding any U.S. income tax return for the prior taxable year that has not (or will not) be filed as of the final installment due date. The status update must identify the due date, set forth in section 6072(c), plus any extension of time to file such return granted under section 6081 and the regulations under section 6081, for any un-filed return identified in the first certificate and state whether the first certificate submitted may continue to be considered by the partnership. If the partnership does not receive an updated certificate or a status update from the partner prior to the partnership's final installment due date, the partnership shall disregard the partner's certificate when computing the 1446 tax due with respect to that partner for the final installment period and when completing its Form 8804 for the taxable year. In addition, the foreign partner shall not be permitted to submit an additional or substitute certificate for the disregarded certificate. See § 1.1446-3(b)(2)(i) for computation requirements for installment payments of 1446 tax when a partnership receives, or fails to receive, an updated certificate or status update. See also paragraph (e)(2)
Examples 4 and 8
of this section. Notwithstanding this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
), a partner that can meet the requirements of this section for a subsequent partnership taxable year may submit a certificate to the partnership under this section for such taxable year.
(
2
)
Other circumstances requiring an updated certificate.
If at any time during the partnership taxable year the partner determines that its most recent certificate furnished to the partnership for such taxable year is incorrect, then the partner shall submit to the partnership an updated certificate in accordance with this paragraph (c) within 10 days of such determination. For example, if the partner determines that the amount or character of the certified deductions or losses is incorrect, the partner shall submit an updated certificate to the partnership. See § 1.1446-3(b)(2)(i) for computation
requirements for installment payments of 1446 tax when a partnership receives an updated certificate.
(
3
)
Form and content of updated certificate.
The updated certificate required by this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) must be provided using the form and instructions identified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The updated certificate must indicate that it is an updated certificate filed in accordance with this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). The partner is not required to attach to the updated certificate a copy of the certificate that is being updated (superseded certificate).
(
4
)
Partnership consideration of an updated certificate.
A partnership may consider an updated certificate, that meets the requirements of this paragraph (c), that is received prior to an installment due date in the same partnership taxable year for which the superseded certificate was provided, or prior to the due date of its Form 8804 (without regard to extensions) to be filed for the year the superseded certificate was provided. A partnership must consider an updated certificate that meets all the requirements of this paragraph (c) if it would increase the amount of 1446 tax the partnership would pay by the next installment due date, if any, or the due date of its Form 8804. An updated certificate considered by the partnership under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(4) supersedes all prior certificates submitted by the foreign partner for the same partnership taxable year, beginning with the installment period or Form 8804 filing date for which the partnership considers the updated certificate. See paragraph (e)(2)
Example 4
of this section.
(3)
Notification to partnership when a partner's certificate cannot be relied upon.
If the IRS determines, in its discretion based on all the facts and circumstances, that a foreign partner's certificate is defective (or that it lacks information sufficient to make this determination after providing written request for such information to the partnership), the IRS shall notify the partnership of such determination in writing. Upon receipt of such written notification, the partnership shall not rely on any certificate submitted by that foreign partner for the partnership taxable year to which the defective certificate relates (or any subsequent partnership taxable year), until the IRS provides written notification to the partnership revoking or modifying the original written notification. For purposes of this section, a foreign partner's certificate of deductions and losses shall be defective if—
(i) The partner is not described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(ii) Any deductions or losses set forth in such certificate are not described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;
(iii) The timing requirements under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for submitting an original certificate, an updated certificate or a status update to the partnership are not met;
(iv) The certificate does not include all of the information required by paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;
(v) Any representation made on the certificate is incorrect;
(vi) The actual amount of deductions and losses available to the partner is less than the amount of deductions and losses certified to the partnership for the partnership taxable year and considered by the partnership in determining its 1446 tax due; or
(vii) There is a failure to comply with any other provision of this section.
(4)
Partner to receive copy of notice.
If the IRS notifies a partnership under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that a certificate of a foreign partner is defective, the IRS shall send a copy of such notice to the partner's address as shown on the certificate. The partnership shall also promptly furnish a copy of the IRS notice to such partner.
(5)
Notification to partnership when no foreign partner's certificate can be relied upon.
If the IRS determines, in its discretion based on all the facts and circumstances, that there would be a substantial reduction in section 1446 tax as a result of the submission of one or more defective certificates or that a substantial portion of all certificates being submitted by partners to the partnership and by the partnership to the IRS are defective (or lack information sufficient to make this determination), then the IRS shall notify the partnership of such determination in writing. Upon receipt of such written notification, the partnership shall not
rely on any certificate submitted by any partner for the partnership taxable year to which the notice relates or any subsequent partnership taxable year, until the IRS provides written notification to the partnership revoking or modifying the original notice.
(6)
Partnership notification to partner regarding use of deductions and losses.
Unless § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(i)(A) or (B) applies (relating to waiver of notice of tax paid during the partnership taxable year), a partnership must notify each foreign partner of the amount of such partner's certified deductions and losses and state and local taxes, if any, taken into account under this paragraph (c) in determining the 1446 tax due with respect to such partner for each installment period or Form 8804 filing date, as applicable.
(7)
Partner's certificate valid only for partnership taxable year for which submitted.
A partnership that receives a certificate from a partnership under this paragraph (c) shall consider such certificate only for the partnership taxable year for which the certificate is submitted, as set forth on the certificate.
(d)
Effect of certificate of deductions and losses on partners and partnership
—(1)
Effect on partner
—(i)
No effect on liability for income tax of foreign partner.
A foreign partner that certifies deductions and losses to a partnership under this section is not relieved of liability for income tax on its allocable share of ECTI from the partnership. Further, the submission of a certificate under this section does not constitute an acceptance by the IRS of the amount or character of the deductions or losses certified therein.
(ii)
No effect on partner's estimated tax obligations.
A foreign partner that certifies deductions and losses to a partnership under this section is not relieved of any estimated tax obligation otherwise applicable to such partner with respect to income or gain allocated to such partner from the partnership.
(iii)
No effect on partner's obligation to file U.S. income tax return.
The submission of a certificate under paragraph (c) of this section does not relieve the foreign partner from its obligation to file a U.S. income tax return even if as a result of the partnership considering the certificate the partner would have no additional tax due with such return. See also § 1.1446-3(f).
(2)
Effect on partnership
—(i)
Reasonable reliance to relieve partnership from addition to tax under section 6655.
A partnership that has reasonably relied on a certificate received from a foreign partner and complied with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, shall not be liable for any addition to tax under section 6655 (as applied through § 1.1446-3) for any period during which the partnership reasonably relied on such certificate, even if such certificate is later determined to be defective or the partner submits an updated certificate under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that increases the 1446 tax due with respect to such partner.
(ii)
Continuing liability for withholding tax under section 1461 and for applicable interest and penalties
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a partnership that has reasonably relied on a certificate received from a foreign partner and complied with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, is not relieved from liability for the 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) under section 1461, any additions to the tax, interest or penalties. However, the partnership may be relieved of additions to the tax or penalties in certain circumstances. See §§ 301.6651-1(c) and 301.6724-1 of this chapter. Further, see § 1.1446-3(e) which deems a partnership to have paid 1446 tax with respect to ECTI allocable to a partner in certain circumstances. See also paragraph (e)(2)
Example 5
of this section.
(B)
Certificate defective because of amount or character of deductions and losses.
If a certificate is determined to be defective because the actual amount of deductions and losses available to the partner is less than the amount reflected on the certificate (other than when it is determined that the partner certified the same deduction or loss to more than one partnership), or because the character of the certified deductions and losses is erroneous, the partnership shall be liable for 1446 tax under section 1461 (or any installment
of such tax) with respect to such partner to the extent the partnership considered an amount of certified deductions and losses greater than the amount actually available to the partner and permitted to be used under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 and this section, or to the extent that the proper character of the certified deductions and losses results in a greater amount of 1446 tax due with respect to such partner. See paragraph (e)(2)
Example 6
of this section.
(3)
Partnership level rules and requirements
—(i)
Filing requirement.
A partnership that relies in whole or in part on a certificate received from a partner under this section in computing its 1446 tax due with respect to such partner must still file Form 8813 or Form 8804 and 8805, whichever is applicable, for the period for which the certificate is considered, even if as a result of relying on the certificate no 1446 tax (or an installment of such tax) is due with respect to such foreign partner. See generally § 1.1446-3(d)(1). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3)(i), the partnership must attach a copy of the foreign partner's certificate, and the computation of the 1446 tax due with respect to such partner, to both the Form 8813 and Form 8805 filed with the IRS for any installment period or year for which such certificate is considered in computing the partnership's 1446 tax. See § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(iii) requiring the partnership to furnish Form 8805 to the IRS and such foreign partner even if no 1446 tax is paid on behalf of the partner. The partnership must include in that computation the amount of state and local taxes described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section taken into account in computing the 1446 tax due with respect to that partner. The partnership must also attach a computation of the 1446 tax due with respect to a partner for whom only state and local taxes described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) are taken into account. For an installment period other than the first installment period for which the partnership considers a foreign partner's certificate or updated certificate, the partnership may, instead of attaching any partner's certificate, attach to Form 8813 a list containing the name, TIN, the amount of certified deductions and losses, and the amount of state and local taxes the partnership may consider under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for each foreign partner whose certificate was relied upon. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the partnership is relying on a certificate received under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, instead of providing the amounts described in the prior sentence, it should attach a statement to Form 8813 which provides that, relying on that certificate, no 1446 tax is due with respect to that partner.
(ii)
Reasonable cause for failure to timely file a valid certificate and computation.
This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) provides the sole source of relief for a partnership that fails to timely file a valid certificate or attach a computation of 1446 tax as required under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. To permit the partnership to reasonably rely on such certificate, the partnership shall be considered to have satisfied the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section if the partnership demonstrates that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if once the partnership becomes aware of the failure, the partnership attaches the certificate and computation, as well as a written statement setting forth the reasons for the failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, to an amended Form 8813 or amended Forms 8804 and 8805 for the relevant period. All such submissions should be sent to the address provided in the instructions to Form 8804-C.
(A)
Determining reasonable cause.
In determining whether the partnership has reasonable cause, the Director shall consider whether the partnership acted reasonably and in good faith considering all the facts and circumstances.
(B)
Notification.
If the IRS has notified, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the partnership that the certificate is defective or that no foreign partner's certificate may be relied upon, as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the partnership will be deemed not to have acted reasonably
and in good faith. Otherwise, the Director shall notify the partnership in writing within 120 days of the amended filing if it is determined that the failure to comply was not due to reasonable cause, or if additional time will be needed to make such determination. If the Director fails to notify the partnership within 120 days of the amended filing, the partnership shall be considered to have demonstrated to the Director that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
(e)
Examples.
(1) The rules of this section are illustrated by the examples in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In 2008, the relevant rate of withholding for foreign partners that were not corporations (that is, the highest rate in section 1 as specified in § 1.1446-3(a)(2)(i)) was 35%, and the due date for filing Form 8804 for domestic calendar year partnerships (that is, the date specified in § 1.1446-3(d)(1)(iii)) was April 15. Except as otherwise provided, in each example assume:
(i) Section 1.1446-3(b)(2)(v)(F) (relating to the de minimis exception to paying 1446 tax) does not apply;
(ii) Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to a nonresident alien individual partner whose sole investment generating effectively connected income or gain is the partnership) does not apply;
(iii) All income and losses are ordinary;
(iv) For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, the percentage limitation under section 56(a)(4) and (d) is 90 percent;
(v) Any loss is not a passive activity loss within the meaning of section 469;
(vi) The partnership uses an acceptable annualization method under § 1.1446-3;
(vii) NRA is a nonresident alien individual who maintains a calendar taxable year for U.S. tax purpose;
(viii) B and C are U.S. individuals who maintain a calendar taxable year; and
(ix) Any partnership maintains a calendar taxable year.
(2) The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Qualifying U.S. income tax return.
(i) NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) in year 4 to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. NRA submits a certificate to PRS (using Form 8804-C) on March 20, year 4, to be considered by PRS in determining its 1446 tax due with respect to NRA for the first installment period in the year 4. The Form 8804-C states that NRA reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $5,000 available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from PRS in year 4. Prior to year 4, NRA had not submitted a certificate to a partnership under this section. NRA filed (or will file) its year 1 U.S. income tax return on March 11, year 3; its year 2 U.S. income tax return on February 12, year 4; its year 3 U.S. income tax return on April 13, year 4; and its year 4 U.S. income tax return on May 14, year 5. NRA paid or (will pay) all amounts due with respect to the returns (including interest, penalties, and additions to tax, if any) by the date they are filed. NRA's years 1 though 3 U.S. income tax returns report income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities.
(ii) To be eligible to submit a certificate of deductions and losses to PRS under this section, NRA must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In accordance with § 1.1446-1, NRA provided valid documentation to PRS to establish its status for purposes of section 1446. NRA's year 1 U.S. income tax return is a qualifying U.S. income tax return because it reported income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities and is described under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Although NRA filed its year 1 return after the due date of the return (determined under section 6072(c) without regard to any extension of time to file) the return was filed on March 11, year 3, which was on or before the earlier of June 15, year 3, the date one year after its section 6072(c) due date without regard to any extension of time to file, and March 20, year 4, the date on which NRA submitted the certificate to PRS. NRA's year 2 U.S. income tax return is a qualifying U.S. income tax return because it reported income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities and is described under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Although NRA filed its year 2 return after the due date of the return (determined under section 6072(c) without regard to any extension of time to file) the return was filed on February 12, year 4, which was on or before the earlier of June 15, year 4, the date one year after its section 6072(c) due date without regard to any extension of time to file, and March 20, year 4, the date on which NRA submitted the certificate to PRS.
NRA's year 3 U.S. income tax return is a qualifying U.S. income tax return because it reported income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities and is described under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Because NRA filed its year 3 U.S. income tax return on April 13, year 4, the return will be considered timely-filed under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, as the due date under section 6072(c) was June 15, year 4. NRA's year 4 U.S. income tax return is a qualifying U.S. income tax return because it reported income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities and is described under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. Because NRA filed its year 4 U.S. income tax return on May 14, year 5, the return will be considered timely-filed under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, NRA meets the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is eligible to provide a certificate of deductions and losses to PRS for year 4.

# Example 2. Subsequent year qualifying U.S. income tax return.
(i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Further, NRA and C form a second partnership (XYZ) in year 7 to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and C provide XYZ appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. NRA did not submit a certificate under this section to any partnership for years 5 and 6. NRA submits a certificate to XYZ (using Form 8804-C) on April 10, year 7, to be considered by XYZ in determining its 1446 tax due with respect to NRA for its first installment period in year 7. The certificate states that NRA reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $8,000 available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from XYZ in year 7. Further, the certificate contains all of the necessary representations required under this section. NRA will file its U.S. income tax return for year 5 on March 25, year 7, (after its section 6072(c) due date and any extension of time to file that could have been granted under section 6081), its U.S. income tax return for year 6 on April 26, year 7; and its U.S. income tax return for year 7 on May 27, year 8. NRA will pay all amounts due with the returns (including interest, penalties, and additions to tax, if any) by the dates they are filed. NRA's years 5, 6, and 7 U.S. income tax returns will report income or gain that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities.
(ii) To be eligible to submit a certificate of deductions and losses to XYZ under this section, NRA must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. NRA provided valid documentation to XYZ in accordance with § 1.1446-1. As described in Example 1, NRA's year 4 U.S. income tax return is a qualifying U.S. income tax return because it will report income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and is described under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. Although NRA's year 5 U.S. income tax return reports income or gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to such activities it is not a qualifying U.S. income tax return under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Because NRA submitted a certificate to PRS in year 4, to constitute a qualifying U.S. income tax return the year 5 U.S. income tax return must be timely-filed and all amounts due with such return must be timely paid. See paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. However, NRA will not file its U.S. income tax return for year 5 until March 25, year 7, (after its section 6072(c) due date and any extension of time to file that could have been granted under section 6081). Because the year 5 tax return is not a qualifying U.S. income tax return under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, NRA does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and, therefore, may not submit a certificate of deductions and losses to XYZ under this section in year 7.

# Example 3. General application of the rules of this section.
NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B are equal partners under the partnership agreement. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. Prior to the formation of PRS, NRA had not invested in or engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. PRS incurs a $1,500 effectively connected net operating loss in years 1 and 2. The loss incurred in each is allocated equally between NRA and B. NRA has filed a qualifying U.S. income tax return (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) for years 1 and 2 that report its allocable share of effective connected net operating loss allocated to it from PRS, as reported on the Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) issued to NRA for each year.
(i) In year 3, NRA may not submit a certificate to PRS under paragraph (c) because it will not have filed qualifying U.S. income tax returns for the preceding three years. In year 3, PRS has ECTI of $1,000 that is allocated equally between NRA and B. PRS satisfies its 1446 tax obligation with respect to NRA for year 3.
(ii) In year 4, PRS estimates that it will have ECTI of $4,000, which will be allocated equally between NRA and B. On or before April 15th of year 4 (the first installment due date), NRA submits a certificate to PRS
under this section (using Form 8804-C) certifying that it reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $1,000 ($750 loss in both years 1 and 2, less $500 of income in year 3) available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from PRS in year 4. As of the date the certificate is submitted, NRA has received the Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) from PRS for year 3 but has not yet filed its U.S. income tax return for year 3.
(iii) With respect to year 4, and based upon paragraph (b)(1) of this section, NRA can include year 3 (NRA's preceding taxable year) as one of the preceding three years that it has filed or will file qualifying U.S. income tax returns (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section). Therefore, provided PRS has, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no actual knowledge or reason to know the certificate is defective, PRS may reasonably rely on NRA's certificate. Accordingly, PRS may consider NRA's certificate to reduce the 1446 tax that would otherwise be required to be paid on NRA's behalf. Specifically, subject to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, the $1,000 of net losses that have been reported on Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) issued to NRA that are available to reduce NRA's U.S. income tax on NRA's allocable share of effectively connected income or gain allocable from PRS may be used to reduce the $2,000 of ECTI estimated to be allocable to NRA. As a result, PRS must pay 1446 tax on only $1,100 of NRA's allocable share of partnership ECTI for the first installment period in year 5 ($2,000−($1,000 × .90)). PRS must pay 1446 tax of $96.25 for its first installment period with respect to the ECTI allocable to NRA ($1,100 (net ECTI after considering certified losses) × .35 (withholding tax rate) × .25 (section 6655(e)(2)(B) percentage for the first installment period)). See § 1.1446-3(b)(2). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, PRS must attach NRA's certificate and PRS's computation of its 1446 tax obligation with respect to NRA to its Form 8813, “Partnership Withholding Tax Payment Voucher (Section 1446),” filed for the first installment period. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, NRA is required to provide an updated certificate on or before the 10th day after NRA files its U.S. income tax return for year 3, even if the updated certificate results in no change to the amount of deductions and losses reported on the superseded certificate.
(iv) The results are the same if NRA had not yet received a Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) from PRS for year 3. See paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

# Example 4. Updated certificate submitted for losses.
On January 1, year 8, NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B are equal partners in PRS. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. During years 1 through 7 NRA held an interest in another partnership (XYZ) that conducted a trade or business in the United States. NRA timely-filed (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) U.S. income tax returns for years 1 through 6 reporting its allocable share of ECTI (or loss) from XYZ (and timely paid all tax shown on such returns). NRA files its U.S. income tax return for year 7 on June 9, year 8 (and timely pays all tax due with such return). Therefore, NRA has filed qualifying U.S. income tax returns (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) for years 1 through 7. During years 1 through 7, NRA's only investment generating effectively connected items was its interest in XYZ. The XYZ partnership liquidated and ceased doing business on December 31, year 7.
(i) On or before April 15, year 8, PRS receives from NRA a valid certificate under this section using Form 8804-C in which NRA certifies that it reasonably expects to have available effectively connected net operating losses in the amount of $5,000. Among other statements made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, NRA represents that it has not yet filed its year 7 U.S. income tax return, but will timely file such return (and timely pay all tax due with such return). For its first installment period in year 8, PRS estimates that it will earn taxable income of $10,000 for the year which will be allocated equally to NRA and B (NRA's allocable share of PRS's ECTI is $5,000).
(ii) Provided PRS has, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no actual knowledge or reason to know the certificate is defective, PRS may reasonably rely on NRA's certificate when computing its 1446 tax obligation for the first installment period. PRS is limited under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section and PRS may only consider $4,500 ($5,000 × .90) of the certified net operating loss. After consideration of the certified loss, PRS owes 1446 tax in the amount of $43.75 for the first installment period ($5,000 estimated allocable ECTI less $4,500 (certified loss as limited under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C)) × .35 (1446 tax applicable percentage) × .25 (section 6655(e)(2)(B) percentage for the first installment period)). See § 1.1446-3(b)(2). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, PRS must attach a copy of NRA's certificate and the computation of 1446 tax due with respect to NRA to the Form 8813 filed with respect to NRA.
(iii) PRS's estimate of ECTI allocable to NRA for the second installment period remains unchanged from the first installment period. On June 10, year 8, NRA provides PRS an updated certificate reporting that NRA now reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $4,000 available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from PRS in year 4. NRA provided
the updated certificate within 10 days of filing its U.S. income tax return for the year 7 taxable year, as required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Provided the updated certificate is otherwise valid, PRS may rely on the updated certificate for the second installment period (due date June 15, year 8). Even if the updated certificate were not valid, PRS could no longer rely on the original certificate.
(iv) Under paragraph (d) of this section, PRS is not relieved from liability for the 1446 tax due with respect to NRA under section 1461 if it relies on a certificate determined to be defective, or if it receives an updated certificate reporting an amount of deductions and losses less than the amount reported on the superseded certificate. Under the principles of section 6655 (as applied through § 1.1446-3), PRS is required to have paid 50-percent of the annualized 1446 tax due with respect to NRA on or before the due date of the second installment period (section 6655(e)(2)(B) percentage for the second installment period). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, because NRA's updated certificate is valid for the second installment period, if PRS considers a certificate for that period it must consider the updated certificate. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, PRS can only consider $3,600 ($4,000 × .90) of NRA's updated effectively connected net operating loss. Assuming PRS considers NRA's updated certificate for the second installment period, PRS must have paid a total of $245 of 1446 tax with respect to the ECTI estimated to be allocable to NRA as of the second installment due date ($1,400 ($5,000 ECTI less $3,600 net operating loss deduction) × .35 (withholding tax rate) × .50 (section 6655(e)(2)(B) percentage for the second installment period)). After considering PRS's payment of 1446 tax for the first installment period, PRS is required to pay $201.25 for the second installment period ($245 less previous payment of $43.75). See § 1.1446-3(b)(2). Further, if PRS considers NRA's updated certificate for the second installment period, when PRS files Form 8813 it must attach the updated certificate along with PRS's computation of 1446 tax due with respect to NRA.
(v) Under paragraph (d) of this section, PRS is not liable for the addition to the tax under section 6655 (as applied through § 1.1446-3) for the first installment period because PRS reasonably relied on NRA's certificate of losses for that period.
(vi) Assume that PRS's estimate of its ECTI allocable to NRA for the third and fourth installment periods is the same as for the first and second installment periods. Assume PRS may reasonably rely on NRA's updated certificate in calculating its payment of 1446 tax for the third and fourth installment periods. The third installment of 1446 tax would be $122.50 (($5,000 − $3,600) × .35 × .75 = $367.50 − $245 (total previous payments)). The fourth installment of 1446 tax would be $122.50 (($5,000 − $3,600) × .35 × 1.00 = $490 − $367.50 (total previous payments)). See § 1.1446-3(b)(2). PRS must attach to each Form 8813 a computation of the 1446 tax due with respect to NRA that takes into account the amount of effectively connected net operating loss reported on NRA's updated certificate.
(vii) Because NRA's certified net operating loss has not changed for the third and fourth installments, in lieu of attaching NRA's certificate, PRS may attach a statement containing NRA's name, TIN, and the certified net operating loss amount. However, PRS must attach NRA's certificate and a computation of the 1446 tax due with respect to NRA that takes into account NRA's certified net operating loss to the Form 8805 filed with respect to NRA. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

# Example 5. IRS determines in subsequent taxable year that partner's certificate is defective because partner failed to timely file a U.S. income tax return.
NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) in year 1 to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. In year 4, NRA timely submits a certificate under this section (using Form 8804-C) to be considered by PRS for its first installment period. The certificate reports that NRA reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $5,000 available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from PRS in year 4. Further, the certificate contains all of the necessary representations required under this section. PRS estimates for each installment period that NRA's allocable share of ECTI will be $5,000 for the taxable year. PRS's actual operating results for the year result in $5,000 of ECTI allocable to NRA.
(i) PRS reasonably relies on (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) NRA's certificate when computing each installment payment during year 4 and the 1446 tax due on Form 8804 and appropriately considers the limitation in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section. As a result, PRS paid $175 of 1446 tax on behalf of NRA for the taxable year ($5,000 of ECTI less $4,500 net operating loss deduction × .35 applicable percentage). As required under paragraph (d) of this section, PRS attached the certificate to the Form 8813 for the first installment period and the Form 8805 for year 4. Because NRA did not submit an updated certificate to PRS in year 4, PRS attached to the Forms 8813 for the second, third and fourth installment periods a statement containing NRA's name, TIN, and the certified net operating loss as well as the computation of 1446 tax due with respect to NRA reflecting the amount of net operating loss considered.
(ii) In year 5, NRA timely submits to PRS a certificate under this section to be considered for the first installment period. The certificate represents that NRA reasonably expects to have an effectively connected net operating loss of $5,000 available to offset its allocable share of ECTI from PRS in year 5. For the first installment period, PRS estimates that NRA's allocable share of partnership ECTI is $5,000. PRS reasonably relies on the certificate for the first installment period and determines that it is required to make a 1446 tax installment payment of $43.75 ($5,000 allocable ECTI less $4,500 (certified net operating loss as limited under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section) × .35 (1446 tax applicable percentage) × .25 (section 6655(e)(2)(B) percentage for the first installment period)). See § 1.1446-3(b)(2). PRS makes the installment payment with the Form 8813 filed for the first installment period, and complies with paragraph (d)(3) of this section by attaching NRA's certificate and the computation of 1446 tax due with respect to NRA to the Form 8813.
(iii) The IRS provides written notification to PRS on June 1, year 5, (pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section) that the certificate received from NRA in year 4 is defective because NRA failed to file a qualifying U.S. income tax return (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) for one of the preceding taxable years as required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notice further states that PRS is not to rely on any certificate received from NRA in year 5.
(iv) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, because the certificate submitted by NRA in year was determined to be defective for a reason other than the amount or character of the certified deductions and losses, under section 1461 PRS is fully liable for the 1446 tax due with respect to NRA's allocable share of ECTI year 4 without regard to the certificate. The total 1446 tax due for year 4 without regard to the certificate is $1,750 ($5,000 ECTI × .35) and PRS paid $175 of 1446 tax in year 4. Therefore, PRS owes $1,575 of 1446 tax. However, PRS may be deemed to have paid the outstanding 1446 tax due if NRA paid all of its U.S. tax due in year 4. See § 1.1446-3(e).
(v) However, because PRS did not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the certificate NRA submitted in year 4 was defective, PRS reasonably relied on the certificate for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Therefore, PRS is not liable for an addition to the tax with respect to its underpayment of 1446 tax under the principles of section 6655 (as applied through § 1.1446-3) for any installment period in year 4.
(vi) However, PRS is generally liable for interest under section 6601 and for the failure to pay addition to tax under section 6651(a)(2) on the $1,575 of 1446 tax due for year 4 for the period from April 15, year 5 (last date prescribed for payment of 1446 tax) to the date PRS pays the 1446 tax or is deemed to have paid the 1446 tax under § 1.1446-3(e).
(vii) With respect to the year 5, PRS reasonably relied on NRA's certificate when computing its first installment payment (due on April 15, year 5). Therefore, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, PRS will not be liable for an addition to the tax under the principles of section 6655 (as applied through § 1.1446-3) for the first installment period. However, because the IRS provided written notification to PRS on June 1, year 5, to disregard any certificate received from NRA for year 5, PRS may not rely on any certificate received from NRA certificate (or any new certificate provided by NRA) when it computes its second installment payment in year 5. PRS is not permitted to consider any certificate submitted by NRA until the IRS provides written notification to PRS revoking or modifying the original notice. PRS's second installment payment in year 5 must include the additional amount of 1446 tax it would have paid for the first installment period without regard to the certificate received from NRA.

# Example 6. IRS determines in subsequent taxable year that partner's certificate is defective because partner's actual losses are less than amount certified and considered by the partnership.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that the IRS determines that NRA's certificate submitted in year 4 is defective because the actual effectively connected net operating loss available to NRA for year 4 was $1,000 rather than the $5,000 certified.
(i) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, PRS is not relieved from its liability for 1446 tax under section 1461 when it relies on a certificate of losses from a foreign partner that is later determined to be defective. However, when the IRS determines that a partner's certificate is defective because of the amount of the certified deductions and losses, the partnership is liable for the 1446 tax, interest, additions to tax, and penalties to the extent the amount of certified deductions and losses taken into account when computing 1446 tax (or, unless there was reasonable reliance on the certificate, any installment of such tax) is greater than the actual amount of available deductions and losses. Here, PRS considered the certified deductions and losses in the amount of $4,500. The IRS subsequently determined that NRA only had $1,000 of actual losses, only $900 of which were permitted to be considered under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section. Accordingly, PRS is liable for the 1446 tax due with respect to the portion of the overstated losses that it considered when computing its 1446 tax. The remaining 1446 tax due for year 4 is $1,260 ($3,600 ($4,500 less $900) of excess losses considered × .35). However, PRS may be deemed to have paid the $1,260 of 1446 tax
under § 1.1446-3(e) if NRA has paid all of NRA's U.S. income tax.
(ii) If PRS had considered only $900 (or a lesser amount) of NRA's certified net operating loss when computing and paying its 1446 tax during year 4 then, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, PRS would not be liable for 1446 tax because it did not consider a net operating loss greater than the amount actually available to NRA.

# Example 7. Partner with different taxable year than partnership.
PRS partnership has two equal partners, FC, a foreign corporation, and DC, a domestic corporation. PRS conducts a trade or business in the United States and generates effectively connected income. FC maintains a June 30 fiscal taxable year end, while DC and PRS maintain a calendar taxable year end. FC and DC provide a valid Form W-8BEN and Form W-9, respectively, to PRS. FC and DC are the only persons that have ever been partners in PRS. For its year 1 through year 3 taxable years, PRS issued Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) reporting in the aggregate $100 of net loss to each partner. For its year 4 taxable year, PRS issued Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) to its partners reporting $150 of loss to each partner. All of the losses reported on the Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) are effectively connected to PRS's and FC's trade or business in the United States.
(i) Assume that FC submits a valid certificate under this section certifying losses to the partnership for the partnership's year 5 taxable year. Further, assume that FC's only source of effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss is the activity of PRS.
(ii) For PRS's first installment period in year 5, FC may only certify deductions and losses under this section in the amount of $100 (the losses as reported on the Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) issued for PRS's year 1 through 3 taxable years). Under section 706, the taxable income of a partner shall include the income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the partnership for the partnership taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner. PRS's year 4 calendar taxable year ends during FC's fiscal taxable year ending June 30, year 5. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as of April 15, year 5 (the last date FC may submit its first certificate under paragraph (c) of this section to have it considered for PRS's first installment due date of April 15, year 5), FC's allocable share of the PRS losses for years 1 through 3 are the only losses that FC can represent have been or will be reported on an FC U.S. income tax return filed for a taxable year ending prior to such installment due date.
(iii) The result in paragraph (ii) of this
Example 7
is the same for the year 5 second installment period, the due date of which is June 15, year 5.
(iv) FC may submit an updated certificate under this section after June 30, year 5, which includes the $150 loss for year 4. PRS may consider such an updated certificate for its third installment period (due date September 15, year 5), provided the updated certificate is received by the due date for such installment in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 8. Failure to provide status update with respect to prior year unfiled returns.
FC, a foreign corporation, and DC, a domestic corporation, form a partnership (PRS) to conduct a trade or business in the United States. FC and DC provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. FC and DC are equal partners in PRS, and all partnership items are allocated equally between FC and DC.
(i) In the current taxable year FC submits a certificate under this section using Form 8804-C prior to PRS's first installment due date. FC represents that it has filed or will file a qualifying U.S. income tax return (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) in each of the preceding three taxable years. FC specifies that it has not filed its U.S. income tax return for the immediately preceding taxable year. FC also represents that it will timely file its U.S. income tax return for the partnership taxable year during which the certificate is considered (and will timely pay all tax due with such return). Assume all other requirements under paragraph (c) of this section are met for FC's certificate to be valid.
(ii) Provided that PRS does not possess actual knowledge or reason to know that FC's certificate is defective under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, PRS may reasonably rely on FC's certificate for its first, second, and third installment payments.
(iii) If FC does not submit to PRS either an updated certificate or a status update as required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section by December 15th (PRS's final installment due date), PRS must disregard FC's certificate when computing its fourth installment payment of 1446 tax and when completing its Form 8804 for the taxable year. PRS's payment of 1446 tax for its fourth installment period must include the additional amount of 1446 tax it would have paid in the first, second and third installment periods had it not considered FC's certificate. Further, even if the status update is provided by December 15th, PRS may only rely on the certificate if the status update does not contradict the original certificate and such update indicates that the immediately preceding year's return will be timely filed. Finally, even if the status update is provided by December 15th, FC must also submit an updated certificate to the partnership in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section within 10 days of the date FC timely
files its U.S. income tax return for the preceding taxable year.

# Example 9. Partnership consideration of certified deductions and losses or de minimis certificate.
For purposes of this example assume paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section may apply. On January 1, year 4, NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B are equal partners in PRS and all partnership items are shared equally. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. During years 1 through 3, NRA's only activity generating effectively connected items was an interest in partnership XYZ. XYZ allocated NRA a loss for all three years. NRA filed qualifying U.S. income tax returns (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) reporting its allocable share of losses from XYZ in years 1 through 3. The XYZ partnership dissolved on December 31, year 3.
(i) In year 4, NRA's only activity giving rise to effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss is its interest in PRS. NRA submits to PRS a valid certificate (using Form 8804-C) certifying under paragraph (c)(1)(i) its effectively connected net operating losses from years 1 through 3 and under (c)(1)(ii) of this section that its only activity giving rise to effectively connected income, gain, deduction, or loss for the PRS taxable year that ends with or within its taxable year is (and will be) its investment in PRS.
(ii) During year 4, PRS allocates ECTI to NRA. If the 1446 tax otherwise due on the annualized amount allocated to NRA is less than $1,000, determined without regard to any deductions and losses certified by NRA under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, PRS may consider the certificate received from NRA under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and not pay 1446 tax (or any installment of such tax) with respect to NRA. Alternatively, PRS may consider the deductions and losses certified by NRA under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(iii) Regardless of whether PRS considers NRA's certification under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section in computing its 1446 tax due with respect to NRA, PRS must file Form 8813 for all installment periods as well as a Form 8805 for NRA with its Form 8804. If PRS considers NRA's certification under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, PRS must attach to each Form 8813, as well as to the Form 8805, a computation of the 1446 tax with respect to NRA that takes into account its consideration of NRA's certificate. In addition, PRS must attach NRA's certificate to the Form 8813 for the first installment period it considers the certificate, as well as to the Form 8805. For all subsequent installment periods, PRS may attach a statement containing NRA's name, and TIN. If PRS is relying on NRA's certified losses under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the statement must indicate the amount of losses and deductions NRA certified. If PRS is relying on NRA's certification under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, the statement must indicate that it is relying on NRA meeting the requirements under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the 1446 tax on the annualized amount allocated to NRA is less than $1,000. See paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 10. Application of transition rule.
NRA and B form a partnership (PRS) on January 1, 2004, to conduct a trade or business in the United States. NRA and B are equal partners in PRS and all partnership items are shared equally. NRA and B provide PRS appropriate documentation under § 1.1446-1 to establish their status for purposes of section 1446. For its 2004 through 2007 tax years, PRS issued Forms 1065 (Schedule K-1) to NRA and B reporting a $1,000 net loss from its U.S. trade or business to each partner for each year (for an aggregate loss of $4,000 per partner). During the 2004 through 2007 tax years, NRA's only activity generating effectively connected items was its investment in PRS.
(i) On February 10, 2008, NRA submitted a certificate to PRS, reporting its aggregate $4,000 effectively connected loss to PRS, that met the requirements of § 1.1446-6T(c) (See 26 CFR Part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007), as in effect before January 1, 2008. The certificate stated that NRA had timely filed its U.S. income tax returns for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax years, and that it would timely file a U.S. income tax return for its 2007 tax year. For the first and second installments period in 2008, PRS estimates that it will earn ECTI of $10,000.
(ii) Because the certificate submitted by NRA to PRS on February 10, 2008, met the requirements of § 1.1446-6T (See 26 CFR Part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007), as in effect before January 1, 2008, PRS may consider such certificate when computing its 1446 tax due for the first and second installment period even if the certificate does not meet all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii) NRA timely files its U.S. income tax return for the 2007 tax year on July 24, 2008. In accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, within 10 days of filing such return NRA prepares an updated certificate to be submitted to PRS certifying that it reasonably expects to have only $3,500 of losses available to reduce its allocable share of ECTI from PRS. Because the updated certificate will be submitted after July 28, 2008, to be valid the updated certificate must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) this section.
(f)
Effective/Applicability date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph
(f), the rules of this section are applicable for partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007. The rules of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B) through (D) shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after July 28, 2008.
(g)
Transition rule.
A certificate that met the requirements of § 1.1446-6T(c) (See 26 CFR Part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007), as in effect before January 1, 2008, submitted on or before July 28, 2008 by a partner that met the requirements of § 1.1446-6T(b) (See 26 CFR Part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007), as in effect before January 1, 2008, shall not be considered defective because it does not meet the requirements of this section. However, any certificate (including any updated certificates and status updates) submitted, or required to be submitted, under paragraph (c) of this section after July 28, 2008, must meet the requirements of this section. See paragraph (e)(2)

§ 1.1446(f)-1
General rules.
(a)
Overview.
This section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5 provide rules for withholding, reporting, and paying tax under section 1446(f) upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition of certain interests in partnerships. This section provides definitions and general rules that apply for purposes of section 1446(f). Section 1.1446(f)-2 provides withholding rules for the transfer of a non-publicly traded partnership interest under section 1446(f)(1). Section 1.1446(f)-3 provides rules that apply when a partnership is required to withhold under section 1446(f)(4) on distributions made to the transferee in an amount equal to the amount that the transferee failed to withhold plus interest. Section 1.1446(f)-4 provides special
rules for the sale, exchange, or disposition of publicly traded partnership interests, for which the withholding obligation under section 1446(f)(1) is generally imposed on certain brokers that act on behalf of the transferor. Section 1.1446(f)-5 provides rules that address the liability for failure to withhold under section 1446(f) and rules regarding the liability of a transferor's or transferee's agent.
(b)
Definitions.
This paragraph (b) provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5.
(1) The term
broker
means any person, foreign or domestic, that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business during the calendar year, stands ready to effect sales made by others, and that, in connection with a transfer of a PTP interest, receives all or a portion of the amount realized on behalf of the transferor. The term broker includes a clearing organization (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(21)). In the case of a U.S. clearing organization clearing or settling sales of PTP interests, however, see § 1.1446(f)-4(a)(3) for an exception from the requirement to withhold on a sale of a PTP interest. The term broker does not include an escrow agent that does not effect sales other than transactions that are incidental to the purpose of escrow (such as sales to collect on collateral).
(2) The term
controlling partner
means a partner that, together with any person that bears a relationship described in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1) to the partner, owns directly or indirectly a 50 percent or greater interest in the capital, profits, deductions, or losses of the partnership at any time within the 12 months before the determination date (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section).
(3) The term
effect
has the meaning provided in § 1.6045-1(a)(10).
(4) The term
foreign person
means a person that is not a United States person, including a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(109)).
(5) The term
PTP interest
means an interest in a publicly traded partnership if the interest is publicly traded on an established securities market or is readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof).
(6) The term
publicly traded partnership
has the same meaning as in section 7704 and §§ 1.7704-1 through 1.7704-4 but does not include a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation under that section.
(7) The term
TIN
means the tax identifying number assigned to a person under section 6109.
(8) The term
transfer
means a sale, exchange, or other disposition, and includes a distribution from a partnership to a partner, as well as a transfer treated as a sale or exchange under section 707(a)(2)(B).
(9) The term
transferee
means any person, foreign or domestic, that acquires a partnership interest through a transfer, and includes a partnership that makes a distribution.
(10) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the term
transferor
means any person, foreign or domestic, that transfers a partnership interest. In the case of a trust, to the extent all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679 (such trust, a grantor trust), the term transferor means the grantor or such other person.
(11) The term
transferor's agent
or
transferee's agent
means any person who represents the transferor or transferee (respectively) in any negotiation with another person relating to the transaction or in settling the transaction. A person will not be treated as a transferor's agent or a transferee's agent solely because it performs one or more of the activities described in § 1.1445-4(f)(3) (relating to activities of settlement officers and clerical personnel).
(12) The term
United States person
or
U.S. person
means a person described in section 7701(a)(30).
(c)
General rules of applicability
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (c) provides general rules that apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5.
(2)
Certifications
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(2) provides rules that are applicable to certifications described in this section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5, except as otherwise provided therein, or as may be prescribed by the
Commissioner in forms or instructions or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter). A certification must provide the name and address of the person providing it. A certification must also be signed under penalties of perjury and, if the certification is provided by the transferor, must include a TIN if the transferor has, or is required to have, a TIN. A transferee (or other person required to withhold) may not rely on a certification if it knows that a transferor has, or is required to have, a TIN, and that TIN has not been provided with the certification. A certification includes any documents associated with the certification, such as statements from the partnership, IRS forms, withholding certificates, withholding statements, certifications, or other documentation. Documents associated with the certification form an integral part of the certification, and the penalties of perjury statement provided on the certification also applies to the associated documents. A certification (other than the certification described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2)) may not be relied upon if it is obtained earlier than 30 days before the transfer or any time after the transfer.
(ii)
Penalties of perjury.
A certification signed under penalties of perjury must provide the following: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined the information on this document, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and complete.”
(iii)
Authority to sign certifications on behalf of a business entity.
A certification provided by a business entity must be signed by an individual who is an officer, director, general partner, or managing member of the entity, or other individual that has authority to sign for the entity under local law.
(iv)
Electronic submission.
A certification may be sent electronically, including as text in an email, an image embedded in an email, or a Portable Document Format (.pdf) attached to an email. An electronic certification, however, may not be relied upon if the person receiving the submission knows that the certification was transmitted by a person not authorized to do so by the person required to execute the certification.
(v)
Retention period.
Any person that relies on a certification pursuant to this section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5 must retain the certification (including any documentation) for as long as it may be relevant to the determination of its withholding obligation under section 1446(f) or its withholding tax liability under section 1461.
(vi)
Submission to IRS.
The recipient of a certification is not required to mail a copy to the IRS, except as provided in § 1.1446(f)-2(b)(7) and (c)(4)(vi) (involving certifications relating to an income tax treaty), or as may be prescribed by the Commissioner in forms or instructions or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(vii)
Grantor trusts.
A certification provided by a transferor that is a grantor or other owner of a grantor trust must identify the portion of the amount realized that is attributable to the grantor or other owner. A certification provided by a foreign grantor trust on behalf of a transferor that is a grantor or owner must also include a Form W-8IMY,
Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting
), (or similar statement for a domestic grantor trust with a foreign grantor or owner), that includes a withholding statement that provides the percentage of the amount realized allocable to each grantor or owner of the trust, and any applicable certification for each grantor or owner. In the case of a certification so provided, a grantor or owner of the trust is treated as having provided the certification to the transferee (or broker).
(3)
Books and records.
A partnership that relies on its books and records pursuant to this section and §§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5 (including for purposes of providing a certification or other statement) must identify in its books and records the date on which the transfer occurred, the information on which the partnership relied, and the provisions of this section and
§§ 1.1446(f)-2 through 1.1446(f)-5 supporting an exception from, or adjustment to, the partnership's obligation to withhold. The identification required by this paragraph (c)(3) must be made no later than 30 days after the date of the transfer. The partnership must retain the identified information in its books and records for the longer of five calendar years following the close of the last calendar year in which it relied on the information or for as long as it may be relevant to the determination of its withholding obligation under section 1446(f) or its withholding tax liability under section 1461.
(4)
Determination date
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(4) provides rules for the determination date. The same determination date must be used for all purposes with respect to a transfer. Any statement, certification, or books and records with regard to a transfer must state the determination date. The determination date of a transfer must be one of the following—
(A) The date of the transfer;
(B) Any date that is no more than 60 days before the date of the transfer; or
(C) The date that is the later of—
(
1
) The first day of the partnership's taxable year in which the transfer occurs, as determined under section 706; or
(
2
) The date, before the date of the transfer, of the most recent event described in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
)(
5
) or (b)(2)(iv)(
s
)(
1
) (revaluation event), irrespective of whether the capital accounts of the partners are adjusted in accordance with § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
).
(ii)
Controlling partner.
The determination date for a transferor that is a controlling partner is determined without regard to paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section.
(5)
IRS forms and instructions.
Any reference to an IRS form includes its successor form. Any form must be filed in the manner prescribed by the Commissioner in forms or instructions or in publications or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §§ 601.601(d)(2) and 601.602 of this chapter).
(d)
Coordination with section 1445.
A transferee that is otherwise required to withhold under section 1445(e)(5) or § 1.1445-11T(d)(1) with respect to the amount realized, as well as under section 1446(f)(1), will be subject to the payment and reporting requirements of section 1445 only, and not section 1446(f)(1), with respect to that amount. However, if the transferor has applied for a withholding certificate under the last sentence of § 1.1445-11T(d)(1), the transferee must withhold the greater of the amounts required under section 1445(e)(5) or 1446(f)(1). A transferee that has complied with the withholding requirements under either section 1445(e)(5) or 1446(f)(1), as applicable under this paragraph (d), will be deemed to satisfy the withholding requirement.
(e)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021.
[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76935, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1446(f)-2
Withholding on the transfer of a non-publicly traded partnership interest.
(a)
Transferee's obligation to withhold.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a transferee is required to withhold under section 1446(f)(1) a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized on any transfer of a partnership interest. This section does not apply to a transfer of a PTP interest that is effected through one or more brokers, including a distribution made with respect to a PTP interest held in an account with a broker. For rules regarding those transfers, see § 1.1446(f)-4.
(b)
Exceptions to withholding
—(1)
In general.
A transferee is not required to withhold under this section if it properly relies on a certification or its books and records as described in this paragraph (b). A transferee may not rely on a certification if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may not rely on its books and records if it knows, or has reason to know, that the information is incorrect or unreliable.
(2)
Certification of non-foreign status by transferor.
A transferee may rely on a certification of non-foreign status from the transferor that states that the transferor is not a foreign person, states the transferor's name, TIN, and address, and is signed under penalties
of perjury. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a certification of non-foreign status includes a valid Form W-9,
Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a transferee may rely on a valid Form W-9 from the transferor that it already possesses if the form meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2).
(3)
No realized gain by transferor
—(i)
In general.
A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution) may rely on a certification from the transferor that states that the transfer of the partnership interest would not result in any realized gain (including ordinary income arising from the application of section 751 and § 1.751-1) to the transferor as of the determination date (see § 1.1446(f)-1(c)(4)). See paragraph (b)(6) of this section for rules that apply when the transferor realizes gain but is not required to recognize the gain under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii)
No section 751 income.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, a transferor may rely on a certification from the partnership stating that the transfer of the partnership interest would not result in any ordinary income arising from the application of section 751 and § 1.751-1 to the transferor as of the determination date. The certification from the partnership must be attached to, and forms part of, the certification of no realized gain that the transferor provides to the transferee.
(iii)
Partnership distributions.
A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may rely on its books and records, or on a certification from the transferor, to determine that the distribution would not result in any realized gain to the transferor as of the determination date.
(4)
Less than 10 percent effectively connected gain
—(i)
In general.
A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution) may rely on a certification from the partnership that states that—
(A) If the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the determination date in the manner described in § 1.864(c)(8)-1(c), either—
(
1
) The partnership would have no gain that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, or, if the partnership would have a net amount of such gain, the amount of the partnership's net gain that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States would be less than 10 percent of the total net gain; or
(
2
) The transferor would not have a distributive share of net gain from the partnership that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if the transferor would have a distributive share of such gain from the partnership, the transferor's distributive share of net gain from the partnership that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States would be less than 10 percent of the transferor's distributive share of the total net gain from the partnership; or
(B) The partnership was not engaged in a trade or business within the United States at any time during the taxable year of the partnership through the date of transfer.
(ii)
Partnership distributions.
A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may rely on its books and records to determine that paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied as of the determination date or paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the partnership through the date of transfer.
(5)
Less than 10 percent effectively connected income
—(i)
In general.
A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution) may rely on a certification from the transferor that states that—
(A) The transferor was a partner in the partnership throughout the look-back period described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section;
(B) The transferor's distributive share of gross effectively connected income from the partnership, as reported on a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065),
Partner's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.,
or other statement required to be furnished under § 1.6031(b)-1T, including any gross effectively connected
income included in the distributive share of a partner that bears a relationship to the transferor described in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), was less than $1 million for each of the taxable years within the look-back period described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section;
(C) The transferor's distributive share of gross effectively connected income from the partnership, as reported on a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), or other statement required to be furnished under § 1.6031(b)-1T, for each of the taxable years within the look-back period described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, was less than 10 percent of the transferor's total distributive share of gross income from the partnership for that year as determined under subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code (as provided on a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or other statement required to be furnished under § 1.6031(b)-1T); and
(D) The transferor's distributive share of income or gain from the partnership that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or deductions or losses properly allocated and apportioned to that income in each of the taxable years within the look-back period described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section has been reported on a Federal income tax return (either filed by the transferor or, in the case of transferor that is a partnership, filed by its direct or indirect nonresident alien individual or foreign corporate partners) on or before the due date (including extensions), and all amounts due with respect to the reported amounts have been timely paid to the IRS, provided that the return was required to be filed when the transferor furnishes the certification (taking into account any extensions of time to file).
(ii)
Look-back period
—(A)
In general.
The transferor's look-back period is the transferor's immediately prior taxable year and the two preceding taxable years.
(B)
Immediately prior taxable year.
The transferor's immediately prior taxable year is the transferor's most recent taxable year—
(
1
) With or within which a taxable year of the partnership ended; and
(
2
) For which a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) was due (including extensions) or furnished (if earlier) before the transfer.
(C)
Limitation.
A transferee may not rely on a certification that is provided before the transferor's receipt of the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii)
No distributive share of gross income.
A transferor that did not have a distributive share of gross income in any year described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section cannot provide the certification described in this paragraph (b)(5).
(iv)
Partnership distributions.
A partnership that is a transferee by reason of making a distribution may rely on its books and records to determine that the requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this section have been satisfied (subject to the rules in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section). The partnership must also obtain a representation from the transferor stating that the requirement in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(D) of this section has been satisfied.
(6)
Certification of nonrecognition by transferor
—(i)
In general.
A transferee may rely on a certification from the transferor that states that by reason of the operation of a nonrecognition provision of the Internal Revenue Code the transferor is not required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the transfer. The certification must briefly describe the transfer and provide the relevant law and facts relating to the certification.
(ii)
Partial nonrecognition.
Paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section does not apply if only a portion of the gain realized on the transfer is subject to a nonrecognition provision. However, see paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section for rules applicable to a transferor's claim for partial nonrecognition.
(7)
Income tax treaties
—(i)
In general.
A transferee may rely on a certification from the transferor that states that the transferor is not subject to tax on any gain from the transfer pursuant to an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country if the requirements of this paragraph (b)(7) are met. The transferor makes the certification on a withholding certificate (on a Form W-8BEN,
Certificate of Foreign Status of
Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals),
or Form W-8BEN-E,
Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)
) that meets the requirements for validity under § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(iv) (or an applicable substitute form that meets the requirements under § 1.1446-1(c)(5)) and that contains the information necessary to support the claim for treaty benefits. A transferee may rely on a certification of treaty benefits only if, within 30 days after the date of the transfer, the transferee mails a copy of the certification to the Internal Revenue Service, at the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10), together with a cover letter providing the name, TIN, and address of the transferee and the partnership in which an interest was transferred.
(ii)
Treaty claim for less than all of the gain.
Paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section does not apply if treaty benefits apply to only a portion of the gain from the transfer. However, see paragraph (c)(4)(vi) of this section for rules applicable to situations in which treaty benefits apply to only a portion of the gain.
(iii)
Exclusive means to claim an exception from withholding based on treaty benefits.
A transferor claiming treaty benefits with respect to all of the gain from the transfer must use the exception in this paragraph (b)(7) and not any other exception or determination procedure in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to claim an exception to withholding by reason of a claim of treaty benefits.
(c)
Determining the amount to withhold
—(1)
In general.
A transferee that is required to withhold under this section must withhold 10 percent of the amount realized on the transfer of the partnership interest, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c). Any procedures in this paragraph (c) apply solely for purposes of determining the amount to withhold under section 1446(f)(1) and this section. A transferee may not rely on a certification if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may not rely on its books and records if it knows, or has reason to know, that the information is incorrect or unreliable.
(2)
Amount realized
—(i)
In general.
The amount realized on the transfer of the partnership interest is determined under section 1001 (including §§ 1.1001-1 through 1.1001-5) and section 752 (including §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-7). Thus, the amount realized includes the amount of cash paid (or to be paid), the fair market value of other property transferred (or to be transferred), the amount of any liabilities assumed by the transferee or to which the partnership interest is subject, and the reduction in the transferor's share of partnership liabilities. In the case of a distribution, the amount realized is the sum of the amount of cash distributed (or to be distributed), the fair market value of property distributed (or to be distributed), and the reduction in the transferor's share of partnership liabilities.
(ii)
Alternative procedures for transferee to determine share of partnership liabilities
—(A)
In general.
A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution), as an alternative to determining the share of partnership liabilities under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, may use the procedures of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) to determine the extent to which a reduction in partnership liabilities is included in the amount realized.
(B)
Certification of liabilities by transferor.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a transferee may rely on a certification from a transferor, other than a controlling partner, that provides the amount of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities reported on the most recent Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) issued by the partnership. If the transferor's actual share of liabilities at the time of the transfer differs from the amount reported on that Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), the certification will not be treated as incorrect or unreliable if the transferor also certifies that it does not have actual knowledge of any events occurring after receiving the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and before the date of the transfer that would cause the amount of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities at the time of the transfer to differ by more
than 25 percent from the amount shown on the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). A transferee may not rely on a certification if the last day of the partnership taxable year for which the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) was provided was more than 22 months before the date of the transfer.
(C)
Certification of liabilities by partnership.
A transferee may rely on a certification from a partnership that provides the amount of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities on the determination date. If the transferor's actual share of liabilities at the time of the transfer differs from the amount on the certification, the certification will not be treated as incorrect or unreliable if the partnership also certifies that it does not have actual knowledge of any events occurring after the determination date and before the date on which the partnership provides the certification to the transferee that would cause the amount of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities at the time of the transfer to differ by more than 25 percent from the amount shown on the certification by the partnership for the determination date.
(iii)
Partnership's determination of partnership liabilities for distributions.
A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may rely on its books and records to determine the extent to which the transferor's share of partnership liabilities on the determination date are included in the amount realized. The information in the books and records will not be treated as incorrect or unreliable unless the partnership has actual knowledge, on or before the date of the distribution, of any events occurring after the determination date that would cause the amount of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities at the time of the transfer to differ by more than 25 percent from the amount determined by the partnership as of the determination date.
(iv)
Certification by a foreign partnership of modified amount realized
—(A)
In general.
When a transferor is a foreign partnership, a transferee may use the procedures of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) to determine the amount realized. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A), the transferee may treat the modified amount realized as the amount realized to the extent that it may rely on a certification from the transferor providing the modified amount realized.
(B)
Determining modified amount realized.
The modified amount realized is determined by multiplying the amount realized (as determined under this paragraph (c)(2), without regard to this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)) by the aggregate percentage computed as of the determination date. The aggregate percentage is the percentage of the gain (if any) arising from the transfer that would be allocated to presumed foreign taxable persons. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B), a presumed foreign taxable person is any direct or indirect partner of the transferor that has not provided either a certification of non-foreign status that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section or a certification of treaty benefits that states that the partner is not subject to tax on any gain from the transfer pursuant to an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country. A valid certification of treaty benefits must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of this section (as applied to the partner claiming treaty benefits), including the requirement that the transferee mail a copy of the certification to the IRS within the time prescribed. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), an indirect partner is a person that owns an interest in the transferor indirectly through one or more foreign partnerships.
(C)
Certification.
The certification is made by providing a withholding certificate (on Form W-8IMY,
Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting
) that includes a withholding statement that provides the percentage of gain allocable to each direct or indirect partner and that provides whether each such person is a United States person, a foreign partner eligible for treaty benefits, or a presumed foreign taxable person. The certification must also include the certification of non-foreign status or the certification of treaty benefits from each direct or indirect partner that is not a presumed foreign taxable person.
(3)
Lack of money or property or lack of knowledge regarding liabilities.
The amount to withhold equals the amount realized determined without regard to any decrease in the transferor's share of partnership liabilities if—
(i) The amount otherwise required to be withheld under this paragraph (c) would exceed the amount realized determined without regard to the decrease in the transferor's share of partnership liabilities; or
(ii) The transferee is unable to determine the amount realized because it does not have actual knowledge of the transferor's share of partnership liabilities (and has not received or cannot rely on a certification described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section).
(4)
Certification of maximum tax liability
—(i)
In general.
A transferee may use the procedures of this paragraph (c)(4) for determining the amount to withhold for purposes of section 1446(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section. A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution) may rely on a certification from a transferor that is a foreign corporation, a nonresident alien individual, a foreign partnership, or a foreign trust regarding the transferor's maximum tax liability as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution may instead rely on its books and records to determine the transferor's maximum tax liability if the books and records includes the information required by paragraphs (c)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section. A transferor that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust is treated as a nonresident alien individual for purposes of determining the transferor's maximum tax liability.
(ii)
Maximum tax liability.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), the term
maximum tax liability
means the amount of the transferor's effectively connected gain (as determined under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section) multiplied by the applicable percentage, as defined in § 1.1446-3(a)(2).
(iii)
Required information.
The certification must include—
(A) A statement that the transferor is either a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, or a foreign trust;
(B) The transferor's adjusted basis in the transferred interest on the determination date;
(C) The transferor's amount realized (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the determination date;
(D) Whether the transferor remains a partner immediately after the transfer;
(E) The amount of outside ordinary gain and outside capital gain that would be recognized and treated as effectively connected gain under § 1.864(c)(8)-1(b) on the determination date (effectively connected gain);
(F) The transferor's maximum tax liability on the determination date;
(G) A representation from the transferor that the transferor determined the amounts described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section based on the statement described in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, if applicable; and
(H) A representation from the transferor that it has provided the transferee with a copy of the statement described in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
Partnership statement.
A transferor may make the representation in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(G) of this section only if the partnership provides to the transferor a statement (that meets the requirements for a certification under the general rules for applicability in § 1.1446(f)-1(c)) that includes—
(A) The partnership's name, address, and TIN; and
(B) The transferor's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary gain, within the meaning of § 1.864(c)(8)-1(c)(3)(ii)(A) (if any) and the transferor's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain, within the meaning of § 1.864(c)(8)-1(c)(3)(ii)(B) (if any), in each case, on the determination date.
(v)
Partial nonrecognition.
If a nonrecognition provision applies to only a portion of the gain realized on the transfer, a certification described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) may be relied upon only if the certification also includes the information required in paragraph (b)(6) of this section (substituting “a portion of the gain or loss” for “any
gain or loss” in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section).
(vi)
Income tax treaties.
If only a portion of the gain on the transfer is not subject to tax pursuant to an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country, a certification described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section may be relied upon only if the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section have been met, including the requirement to obtain the applicable withholding certificate indicating that the gain from the transfer is not subject to tax pursuant to an income tax treaty (substituting “a portion of the gain” for “any gain” in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section), and the requirement to mail a copy of the withholding certificate to the IRS.
(d)
Reporting and paying withheld amounts
—(1)
In general.
A transferee required to withhold under this section must report and pay any tax withheld by the 20th day after the date of the transfer using Forms 8288,
U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests,
and 8288-A,
Statement of Withholding on Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests,
in accordance with the instructions to those forms. The IRS will stamp Form 8288-A to show receipt and mail a stamped copy to the transferor (at the address reported on the form). See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the procedures for the transferor to claim a credit for amounts withheld. Forms 8288 and 8288-A must include the TINs of both the transferor and the transferee. If any required TIN is not provided, the transferee must still report and pay any tax withheld on Form 8288.
(2)
Certification of withholding to partnership for purposes of section 1446(f)(4).
A transferee (other than a partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution) must certify to the partnership the extent to which it has satisfied its obligation to withhold under this section no later than 10 days after the transfer. The certification must either include a copy of Form 8288-A that the transferee files with respect to the transfer, or state the amount realized and the amount withheld on the transfer. The certification must also include any certifications that the transferee relied on to apply an exception to withholding under paragraph (b) of this section or to determine the amount to withhold under paragraph (c) of this section. A transferee that relied on a certification to apply an exception or adjustment to withholding remains liable under this section when the partnership knows, or has reason to know, that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. See § 1.1446(f)-3 for rules regarding a partnership's obligation to withhold on distributions to a transferee when this certification establishes only partial satisfaction of the required amount, is not provided, or cannot be relied upon.
(e)
Effect of withholding on transferor
—(1)
In general.
The withholding of tax by a transferee under this section does not relieve a foreign person from filing a U.S. tax return with respect to the transfer. See §§ 1.6012-1(b)(1), 1.6012-2(g)(1), and 1.6031(a)-1. Further, the withholding of tax by a transferee does not relieve a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation subject to tax on gain by reason of section 864(c)(8) from paying any tax due with the return that has not been fully satisfied through withholding.
(2)
Manner of obtaining credit
—(i)
Individuals or corporations.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an individual or corporation may claim a credit under section 33 for the amount withheld under this section by attaching to its applicable return the stamped copy of Form 8288-A provided to it under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Partnerships, trusts, or estates.
For a rule allowing a foreign partnership that is a transferor to claim a credit for the amount withheld under this section against its tax liability under section 1446(a), see § 1.1446-3(c)(4). For the rule providing the extent to which a foreign trust or estate may claim a credit for an amount withheld under this section, see § 1.1462-1. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a foreign partnership, trust, or estate claiming a credit for an amount withheld must attach to its applicable return the stamped copy of Form 8288-A provided to it under paragraph (d)(1)
of this section. A foreign trust or estate must also provide any other information required in forms or instructions to any beneficiary or owner that is liable for tax on any of the gain under section 864(c)(8).
(3)
Failure to receive Form 8288-A.
If a stamped copy of Form 8288-A has not been provided to the transferor by the IRS, the transferor may establish the amount of tax withheld by the transferee by attaching to its return substantial evidence of the amount. The transferor must attach to its return a statement that includes all of the information otherwise required to be provided on Form 8288-A.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021.
[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76935, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1446(f)-3
Partnership's requirement to withhold under section 1446(f)(4) on distributions to transferee.
(a)
Partnership's obligation to withhold amounts not withheld by the transferee
—(1)
In general.
If a transferee fails to withhold any amount required to be withheld under § 1.1446(f)-2, the partnership in which the interest was transferred must withhold from any distributions with respect to the transferred interest pursuant to this section. To determine its withholding obligation under this paragraph (a)(1), a partnership may rely on a certification received from the transferee described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) unless it knows, or has reason to know, that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. A partnership that already possesses a certification of non-foreign status (including a Form W-9) for the transferor that meets the requirements provided in § 1.1446(f)-2(b)(2) may instead rely on this certification to determine that it has no withholding obligation under this paragraph (a)(1) unless it knows, or has reason to know, that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. A partnership that receives a certification described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) that is inconsistent with the information on the certification of non-foreign status in its possession is treated as having actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the certification of non-foreign status is incorrect or unreliable.
(2)
Notification by IRS.
A partnership that receives notification from the IRS that a transferee has provided incorrect information regarding the amount realized or amount withheld on the certification described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2), or has failed to pay the IRS the amount reported as withheld on the certification, must withhold the amount prescribed in the notification on distributions with respect to the transferred interest made on or after the date that is 15 days after it receives the notification. The IRS will not issue a notification on the basis that the amount realized on the certification described in § 1.446(f)-2(d)(2) is incorrect if it determines that the transferee properly relied on a certification that included the incorrect information to compute the amount realized pursuant to § 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2).
(3)
Subsequent transferees.
A partnership is not required to withhold under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section on distributions that are made after the date on which the transferee disposes of the transferred interest, unless the partnership has actual knowledge that any person that acquires the transferee's interest in the partnership is a related person,
i.e.,
a person that bears a relationship described in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1) with respect to the transferee or the transferor from which the transferee acquired the interest. A related person that acquires the transferee's interest is treated as liable for tax under section 1461 to the same extent that the transferee is liable for its failure to withhold under § 1.1446(f)-2.
(b)
Exceptions to withholding
—(1)
Withholding has been satisfied by transferee.
A partnership is not required to withhold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it relies on a certification described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) received from the transferee (within the time prescribed in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2)) that states that an exception to withholding described in § 1.1446(f)-2(b) applies or that the transferee withheld the full amount required to be withheld (taking into account any adjustments under § 1.1446(f)-2(c)) under § 1.1446(f)-2.
(2)
PTP interests.
A partnership is not required to withhold under this section on distributions made with respect to a PTP interest.
(3)
Distributing partnerships.
A partnership that is a transferee because it makes a distribution is not required to withhold under this section.
(c)
Withholding rules
—(1)
Timing of withholding
—(i)
In general.
A partnership required to withhold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must withhold on distributions made with respect to a transferred interest beginning on the later of—
(A) The date that is 30 days after the date of transfer; or
(B) The date that is 15 days after the date on which the partnership acquires actual knowledge that the transfer has occurred.
(ii)
Satisfaction of withholding obligation.
A partnership is treated as satisfying its withholding obligation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and may stop withholding on distributions with respect to a transferred interest on the earlier of—
(A) The date on which the partnership completes withholding and paying the amount required to be withheld under paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or
(B) The date on which the partnership receives and may rely on a certification from the transferee described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) (without regard to whether the certification is received by the time prescribed in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2)) that claims an exception to withholding under § 1.1446(f)-2(b).
(2)
Amount to withhold
—(i)
In general.
A partnership required to withhold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must withhold the full amount of each distribution made with respect to the transferred interest until it has withheld—
(A) A tax of 10 percent of the amount realized (determined solely under § 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2)(i)) on the transfer, reduced by any amount withheld by the transferee; plus
(B) Any interest computed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Computation of interest.
The amount of interest required to be withheld under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the amount of interest that would be required to be paid under section 6601 and § 301.6601-1 of this chapter if the amount that should have been withheld by the transferee was considered an underpayment of tax. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), interest is payable between the date that is 20 days after the date of the transfer and the date on which the tax due under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is paid to the IRS.
(iii)
Certifications required.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a partnership must determine the amount realized on the transfer and any amount withheld by the transferee based on a certification from the transferee described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2), without regard to whether the certification is received by the time prescribed in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2). A partnership that does not receive or cannot rely on a certification from the transferee described in § 1.1446(f)-2(d)(2) must withhold tax equal to the full amount of each distribution made with respect to a transferred interest until it receives a certification that it can rely on.
(3)
Coordination with other withholding provisions.
Any amount required to be withheld on a distribution under any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code is not also required to be withheld under section 1446(f)(4) or this section.
(d)
Reporting and paying withheld amounts.
The partnership must report and pay the tax withheld using Forms 8288,
U.S. Withholding Tax Return for Dispositions by Foreign Persons of U.S. Real Property Interests,
and 8288-C,
Statement of Withholding Under Section 1446(f)(4) for Withholding on Dispositions by Foreign Persons of Partnership Interests,
as provided in forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(e)
Effect of withholding on transferor and transferee
—(1)
Transferor.
The withholding of tax by a partnership under this section does not relieve a foreign person from filing a U.S. income tax return with respect to the transfer. See §§ 1.6012-1(b)(1), 1.6012-2(g)(1), and 1.6031(a)-1. Further, the withholding of tax by a partnership does not relieve a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation subject to tax on gain by reason of section 864(c)(8) from paying any tax due with the return that has not been fully satisfied through withholding. An individual or corporation is not allowed a credit under section 33 for amounts withheld on distributions
to the transferee under this section. See, however, §§ 1.1446(f)-5(a) and 1.1463-1(a), which generally provide that tax will not be recollected if paid by another person.
(2)
Transferee.
A transferee is treated as satisfying its withholding tax liability under § 1.1446(f)-2 to the extent that a partnership withholds tax (which does not include interest) under this section. Interest computed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section that is withheld by the partnership from the transferee is treated as interest paid by the transferee with respect to its withholding tax liability under § 1.1446(f)-2. An excess amount under this section is the amount of tax and interest withheld under this section that exceeds the transferee's withholding tax liability under § 1.1446(f)-2 plus any interest owed by the transferee with respect to such liability. A transferee may claim a refund for the excess amount if payments have been made in excess of the tax which is properly due by the transferee for the tax period.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers that occur on or after January 1, 2022.
[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76935, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1446(f)-4
Withholding on the transfer of a publicly traded partnership interest.
(a)
Obligation to withhold on a transfer of a PTP interest
—(1)
In general.
If a transfer of a PTP interest is effected through one or more brokers (as defined in § 1.1446(f)-1(b)(1)), the transferee is not required to withhold under section 1446(f)(1) and§ 1.1446(f)-2. Rather, any broker required to withhold under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the transfer of a PTP interest, except as otherwise provided in this section. For cases in which a publicly traded partnership is liable for withholding under this section, see paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Broker's requirement to withhold
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a broker is required to withhold under this section if it pays an amount realized to another broker that it is required to treat as a foreign person, or if a broker pays an amount realized to a foreign transferor that is its customer.
(ii)
Payments to foreign brokers.
A broker that pays an amount realized from the transfer of a PTP interest to another broker that it is required to treat as a foreign person must withhold under this section unless the first-mentioned broker obtains documentation on which it may rely establishing that the second-mentioned broker is described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. A broker must treat any broker to which it pays an amount realized from the transfer of a PTP interest as a foreign person unless it obtains, or already possesses, documentation (including a certification of non-foreign status) on which it may rely that establishes that the other broker is a U.S. person. A broker may rely on documentation described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), or in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, unless it has actual knowledge that the documentation is unreliable or incorrect.
(A) A broker is described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) if it is a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) that provides a valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii)) that states that it assumes primary withholding responsibility for the payment.
(B) A broker is described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) if it is a U.S. branch of a foreign person (as described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)) that provides a valid U.S. branch withholding certificate (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), but without regard to the requirement in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) that the certificate state that the amount is not effectively connected with a trade or business within the United States) that states that the U.S. branch agrees to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment.
(iii)
Payments to foreign transferors that are customers of the broker.
A broker that pays an amount realized to a foreign transferor that is its customer (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(2)) from the transfer of a PTP interest is required to withhold under this section
unless an exception under paragraph (b) of this section applies.
(3)
Exception from certain withholding by U.S. clearing organizations.
A broker that is a U.S. clearing organization clearing or settling a sale of a PTP interest is not required to withhold on the amount realized from the sale. However, see § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(i)(R)(
2
) for the requirement that a U.S. clearing organization acting as a central counterparty report on Form 1042-S sales of PTP interests that it clears and settles on a net basis.
(4)
Exception when withholding already satisfied.
A broker that receives from another broker an amount realized from the transfer of a PTP interest is required to withhold under this section unless the other broker has withheld the full amount required. A broker that receives from another broker an amount realized from the transfer of a PTP interest may treat the withholding as having been satisfied on the full amount required unless it knows or has reason to know that the withholding obligation has not already been satisfied. A broker that is a qualified intermediary determines its withholding requirement for purposes of this paragraph (a)(4) in accordance with its qualified intermediary agreement.
(5)
Documentation obtained from another person to determine a broker's status.
A U.S. clearing organization may act as an agent for a broker receiving an amount realized from another broker that is a member of the clearing organization for purposes of furnishing valid documentation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section of the first-mentioned broker's status to such other broker, provided the clearing organization notifies the first-mentioned broker and such broker has the ability to opt out. A broker that obtains documentation from a clearing organization under this paragraph (a)(5) for a broker to which the first-mentioned broker is paying an amount realized may rely on such documentation unless it has actual knowledge that the documentation is incorrect or unreliable.
(6)
Date of withholding with respect to a transfer other than a distribution.
For a transfer of a PTP interest that is not a distribution, a broker is required to apply the principles of § 31.3406(a)-4(b)(1) of this chapter to determine the date on which to withhold under this section.
(7)
Payments to qualified intermediaries not assuming primary withholding responsibility.
With respect to the transfer of a PTP interest, if a broker pays the amount realized to a foreign person that the broker may treat as a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) that does not assume primary withholding responsibility for the payment based on a valid qualified intermediary withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) upon which the broker may rely under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the broker may withhold as provided in this paragraph (a)(7). Under this paragraph (a)(7), a broker may withhold under this section by reference to the amount of the payment that the broker can reliably determine, based on the withholding statement provided with the withholding certificate, is allocable to—
(i) Foreign transferors included in a chapter 3 withholding rate pool (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)) that are subject to a 10 percent rate of withholding on the payment of the amount realized;
(ii) Foreign transferors included in a chapter 3 withholding rate pool (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)) that qualify for an exception from withholding on the payment of the amount realized under paragraph (b) of this section;
(iii) Each foreign transferor for which a form acceptable under § 1.1446-1 is provided; or
(iv) U.S. transferors, based on a valid Form W-9 provided for each such transferor to the extent that the transferor is not included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C), to the extent permitted for purposes of chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code).
(8)
Qualified intermediary or U.S. branch withholding requirement.
A broker that is a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)) or U.S. branch must assume primary withholding responsibility under this section for a distribution from a publicly
traded partnership for which the qualified intermediary or U.S. branch acts as a nominee for purposes of section 1446(a). See § 1.1446-4(b)(3).
(b)
Exceptions to withholding
—(1)
In general.
A broker is not required to withhold under this section if it properly relies on a certification described in paragraph (b)(2), (5), or (6) of this section, a qualified notice described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or if the exception described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies. A broker may not rely on a certification described in this paragraph (b) if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable.
(2)
Certification of non-foreign status.
A broker may rely on a certification of non-foreign status that it obtains from the transferor. A certification of non-foreign status under this section means a Form W-9,
Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,
or valid substitute form, that meets the requirements of § 1.1441-1(d)(2). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a broker may rely on a valid form that it already possesses from the transferor. A broker may instead rely on certification from a second broker (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1)) that acts as an agent for the transferor when the second broker does not receive the amount realized from the transfer of the PTP interest. This certification must state that the second broker has collected a valid certification of non-foreign status (within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2)) from the transferor, and it must include the transferor's TIN and status as a foreign or U.S. person.
(3)
Less than 10 percent effectively connected gain by partnership
—(i)
In general.
A broker may rely on a qualified notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section that states that the 10-percent exception applies, as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In a case in which a broker properly relies on a qualified notice under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that results in underwithholding on a transfer of a PTP interest, the publicly traded partnership that issued the notice is solely liable for the underwithheld tax under section 1461. A publicly traded partnership's liability referenced in the preceding sentence, however, applies only when the publicly traded partnership fails to make a reasonable estimate of the amounts required for determining the applicability of the 10-percent exception.
(ii)
10-percent exception
—(A)
In general.
The 10-percent exception applies to a transfer if, on the PTP designated date described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section—
(
1
) If the publicly traded partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value in the manner described in § 1.864(c)(8)-1(c), either—
(
i
) The amount of net gain that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States would be less than 10 percent of the total net gain; or
(
ii
) No gain would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or
(
2
) The partnership was not engaged in a trade or business within the United States at any time during the taxable year of the partnership through the PTP designated date.
(B)
PTP designated date.
The PTP designated date for a transfer is any date for a deemed sale determination that is designated by the publicly traded partnership in a qualified notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, provided that the PTP designated date occurs on or after the date that is 92 days before the date on which the publicly traded partnership posted the qualified notice naming the PTP designated date.
(iii)
Qualified notice
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, a qualified notice described in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) is the most recent qualified notice (within the meaning of § 1.1446-4(b)(4)) posted by the publicly traded partnership.
(B)
Qualified notice posting date requirement.
A qualified notice is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) only if the publicly traded partnership has posted it within the 92-day period ending on the date of the transfer. For a transfer that is a distribution by the publicly traded partnership, the qualified notice is described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section only if the
qualified notice is posted with respect to the distribution.
(C)
Recent posting of qualified notice.
If the most recent qualified notice posted by the publicly traded partnership was posted during the 10-day period ending on the date of the transfer, a broker may instead rely on the immediately preceding qualified notice (within the meaning of § 1.1446-4(b)(4)) posted by the publicly traded partnership, provided that it satisfies the condition described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(4)
Amount subject to withholding under section 3406.
A broker is not required to withhold under this section if the amount realized from the transfer of the PTP interest is subject to withholding under § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 of this chapter.
(5)
Income tax treaties.
A broker may rely on a certification from the transferor that states that the transferor is not subject to tax on any gain from the transfer pursuant to an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country if the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) are met. The transferor makes the certification on a withholding certificate (on a Form W-8BEN,
Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals),
or Form W-8BEN-E,
Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)
) that meets the requirements for validity under § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(iv) (or an applicable substitute form that meets the requirements under § 1.1446-1(c)(5)) and that contains the information necessary to support the claim for treaty benefits. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), a broker may rely on a withholding certificate that it already possesses from the transferor that meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) unless it has actual knowledge that the information is incorrect or unreliable. The exception in this paragraph (b)(5) does not apply if treaty benefits apply to only a portion of the gain from the transfer.
(6)
Foreign dealers that provide Form W-8ECI.
A broker may rely on a certification provided by a transferor that certifies that it is a dealer in securities (as defined in section 475(c)(1)) and that any gain from the transfer of the PTP interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States without regard to the provisions of section 864(c)(8). The certification described in the preceding sentence is made on a Form W-8ECI,
Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States,
that meets the requirements for validity under § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(iv) (or an applicable substitute form that meets the requirements under § 1.1446-1(c)(5)) and that contains any other information required in the instructions to the form. A broker may rely on a withholding certificate that it already possesses from the transferor that meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(6) unless it has actual knowledge that the information is incorrect or unreliable.
(c)
Determining the amount to withhold
—(1)
In general.
A broker that is required to withhold under this section must withhold 10 percent of the amount realized on the transfer of the PTP interest, except as provided in this paragraph (c). Any procedures in this paragraph (c) apply solely for purposes of determining the amount to withhold under section 1446(f)(1) and this section. A broker may not rely on a certification described in this paragraph (c) if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable.
(2)
Amount realized
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this section, the amount realized is the amount of gross proceeds (as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(5)) paid or credited upon the transfer to the customer or other broker (as applicable), or, in the case of a distribution, the amount determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Certification by a foreign partnership of modified amount realized
—(A)
In general.
When a transferor is a foreign partnership, a broker may use the procedures of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) to determine the amount realized. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), the broker may treat the modified amount realized as the amount realized to the extent it may rely on a certification from the transferor providing the modified amount realized.
(B)
Determining modified amount realized.
The modified amount realized is determined by multiplying the amount realized (as determined under this paragraph (c)(2), without regard to this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)) by the aggregate percentage computed as of the determination date (see § 1.1446(f)-1(c)(4)). The aggregate percentage is the percentage of the gain (if any) arising from the transfer that would be allocated to presumed foreign taxable persons. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B), a presumed foreign taxable person is any direct or indirect partner of the transferor that has not provided either a certification of non-foreign status that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section or a certification of treaty benefits that states that the partner is not subject to tax on any gain from the transfer pursuant to an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign country. A valid certification of treaty benefits must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section (as applied to the partner claiming treaty benefits). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), an indirect partner is a person that owns an interest in the transferor indirectly through one or more foreign partnerships.
(C)
Certification.
The certification is made by providing a withholding certificate (on Form W-8IMY,
Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting
) that includes a withholding statement that provides the percentage of gain allocable to each direct or indirect partner and that provides whether each such person is a United States person, a foreign partner eligible for treaty benefits, or a presumed foreign taxable person. The certification must also include the certification of non-foreign status or the certification of treaty benefits from each direct or indirect partner that is not a presumed foreign taxable person. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), a broker may rely on a withholding certificate and withholding statement that it already possesses from the partnership unless it has actual knowledge that the information is incorrect or unreliable.
(iii)
Determination of amount realized on a distribution.
The amount realized on a distribution from a publicly traded partnership is the amount of the distribution reduced by the portion of the distribution that is attributable to the cumulative net income of the partnership. The cumulative net income is the net income earned by the publicly traded partnership since its formation that has not been previously distributed by the partnership. A publicly traded partnership identifies such excess portion of the distribution as an amount in excess of cumulative net income on a qualified notice (within the meaning of § 1.1446-4(b)(4)) posted with respect to the distribution. If a broker properly withholds based on the qualified notice (applying the rules of § 1.1446-4(d)(1) to the distribution), the broker is not liable for any underwithholding on any amount attributable to an amount in excess of cumulative net income. Rather, the publicly traded partnership that issued the qualified notice is solely liable for the underwithheld tax under section 1461 on such amount that results from a broker's reliance on the notice.
(d)
Reporting and paying withheld amounts.
A broker that is required to withhold under this section must pay the withheld tax pursuant to the deposit rules in § 1.6302-2. For rules regarding reporting on Forms 1042,
Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,
and 1042-S,
Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,
that apply to a broker that withholds under this section, see § 1.1461-1(b) and (c). For rules regarding when an amount realized on the transfer of a PTP interest is reportable on a Form 1042-S (including in certain cases in which withholding is not required), see § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(i)(Q) and (R). A broker that pays the amount realized to a foreign partnership must issue a Form 1042-S directly to the partnership rather than issuing a form to each of the partners of the partnership.
See
§ 1.1461-1(c)(1)(ii)(A)(
8
) (treating the foreign partnership as a recipient for reporting purposes). A broker making a payment to a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person must not treat the branch as a U.S. person for purposes of reporting the
payment made to the branch. Therefore, a payment to that U.S. branch must be reported on Form 1042-S.
See
§ 1.1461-1(c). A Form 1042-S issued directly to the transferor must include the TIN of the transferor unless the broker does not know the TIN at the time of issuance.
(e)
Effect of withholding on transferor
—(1)
In general.
The withholding of tax under this section does not relieve a foreign person from filing a U.S. tax return with respect to the transfer.
See
§§ 1.6012-1(b)(1), 1.6012-2(g)(1), and 1.6031(a)-1. Further, the withholding of tax by a broker does not relieve a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation subject to tax on gain by reason of section 864(c)(8) from paying any tax due with the return that has not been fully satisfied through withholding.
(2)
Manner of obtaining credit
—(i)
Individuals and corporations.
An individual or corporation may claim a credit under section 33 for the amount withheld under this section by attaching to its applicable return a copy of a Form 1042-S that includes its TIN (or as otherwise provided in IRS forms or instructions).
(ii)
Partnerships, trusts, or estates.
For a rule allowing a foreign partnership that is a transferor to claim a credit for the amount withheld under this section against its obligation to withhold under section 1446(a), see § 1.1446-3(c)(4). For the rule providing the extent to which a foreign trust or estate may claim a credit for an amount withheld under this section, see § 1.1462-1. A foreign partnership, trust, or estate claiming a credit for an amount withheld must attach to its applicable return the Form 1042-S provided to it under paragraph (d) of this section (or as otherwise provided in IRS forms or instructions). A foreign trust or estate must also provide any information required in forms or instructions to any beneficiary or owner that is liable for tax on any of the gain under section 864(c)(8).
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers that occur on or after January 1, 2022.
[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76935, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1446(f)-5
Liability for failure to withhold.
(a)
Liability for failure to withhold.
Every person required to withhold and pay tax under section 1446(f), but that fails to do so, is liable for the tax under section 1461, plus any applicable interest, penalties, or additions to tax. A partnership that failed to withhold and pay tax under § 1.1446(f)-3 is liable only for the amount of tax that it failed to collect (but not any interest computed on that amount under § 1.1446(f)-3(c)(2)(ii)), plus any interest, penalties, or additions to tax with regard to the partnership's failure to withhold.
(b)
Tax liability otherwise satisfied.
Under section 1463, if the tax required to be withheld under section 1446(f) is paid by another person required to withhold under section 1446(f), or by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation subject to tax on gain resulting from section 864(c)(8), the tax will not be recollected. The person required to withhold must establish proof of payment by another person required to withhold or by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation subject to the tax on gain resulting from section 864(c)(8). The person required to withhold may show that a reduced rate of withholding was appropriate by establishing the amount of tax due by the foreign transferor (as defined in § 1.864(c)(8)-1(g)(3)) on gain resulting from section 864(c)(8). The person required to withhold under section 1446(f) is not relieved from liability for any interest, penalties, or additions to tax that would otherwise apply. However, if the person required to withhold establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that no gain on the transfer is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States under section 864(c)(8), no interest, penalties, or additions to tax will apply.
(c)
Liability of agents
—(1)
Duty to provide notice of false certification.
A transferee's or transferor's agent (other than a broker required to withhold under § 1.1446(f)-4) must provide notice to a transferee (or other person required to withhold) if that person is furnished with a certification described in §§ 1.1446(f)-1 through 1.1446(f)-4 that
the agent knows is false. A person required to withhold may not rely on a certification if it receives the notice described in this paragraph (c)(1).
(2)
Procedural requirements.
Any agent who is required to provide notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must do so in writing (including by electronic submission) as soon as possible after learning of the false certification. If the agent first learns of the false certification before the date of transfer, notice must be given by the third day following that discovery but no later than the date of transfer (before the transferee's payment of consideration). If an agent first learns of a false certification after the date of transfer, notice must be given by the third day following that discovery. The notice must also explain the possible consequences to the recipient of a failure to withhold. The notice need not disclose the information on which the agent's statement is based. The agent must also furnish a copy of the notice to the IRS by the date on which the notice is required to be given to the recipient. The copy of the notice must be delivered to the address provided in § 1.1445-1(g)(10) and must be accompanied by a cover letter stating that the copy is being filed pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Failure to provide notice.
Any agent who is required to provide notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but fails to do so in the manner required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is liable for the tax that the person who should have been provided notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section was required to withhold under section 1446(f) if the notice had been given.
(4)
Limitation on liability.
An agent's liability under paragraph (c)(3) of this section is limited to the amount of compensation that the agent derives from the transaction. In addition, an agent that assists in the preparation of, or fails to disclose knowledge of, a false certification may be liable for civil and criminal penalties.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021.
[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76935, Nov. 30, 2020]

# Tax-Free Covenant Bonds
§ 1.1451-1
Tax-free covenant bonds issued before January 1, 1934.
(a)
Rates of withholding
—(1)
Rate of 2 percent.
Withholding of a tax equal to 2 percent is required in the case of interest upon bonds or other corporate obligations containing a tax-free covenant and issued before January 1, 1934, paid to an individual, a fiduciary, or a partnership, whether resident or nonresident, or to a nonresident foreign corporation, regardless of whether the liability assumed by the obligor is less than, equal to, or greater than 2 percent.
(2)
Rate of 30 percent.
Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, if the liability assumed by the obligor does not exceed 2 percent of the interest, withholding is required at the rate of 30 percent in the case of payments to a nonresident alien individual, a nonresident partnership composed in whole or in part of nonresident aliens, a nonresident foreign corporation, or an owner who is unknown to the withholding agent.
(3)
Obligations of resident payers.

(4)
Obligations of nonresident payers.
A nonresident foreign corporation having a fiscal or paying agent in the United States is required to withhold a tax of 2 percent in the case of interest upon its tax-free covenant bonds issued before January 1, 1934, which is paid to an individual or fiduciary who is a citizen or resident of the United States, to a partnership any member of which is a citizen or resident, or to an unknown owner.
(5)
Interest from sources without the United States.
Withholding is not required under section 1451 in the case of interest upon bonds or other corporate obligations issued before January 1, 1934, and containing a tax-free covenant if the interest is not to be treated as income from sources within the United States and the payments are made to a nonresident alien, a partnership composed wholly of nonresident
aliens, or a nonresident foreign corporation.
(6)
Tax treaties.
The rates of tax to be withheld in accordance with this paragraph shall be reduced as may be provided by treaty with any country. See section 894 and § 1.1441-6 relating to income subject to a reduced rate of, or an exemption from, income tax pursuant to an income tax convention.
(b)
Date of issue.
The withholding provisions of section 1451 are applicable only to bonds, mortgages, or deeds of trust, or other similar obligations of a corporation which were issued before January 1, 1934, and which contain a tax-free covenant. For the purpose of section 1451, bonds, mortgages, or deeds of trust, or other similar obligations of a corporation, are issued when delivered. If a broker or other person acts as selling agent of the obligor, the obligation is issued when delivered by the agent to the purchaser. If a broker or other person purchases the obligation outright for the purpose of holding or reselling it, the obligation is issued when delivered to such broker or other person.
(c)
Extended maturity date.
In cases where on or after January 1, 1934, the maturity date of bonds or other obligations of a corporation is extended, the bonds or other obligations shall be considered to have been issued on or after January 1, 1934. The interest on such obligations is not subject to the withholding provisions of section 1451 but falls within the class of interest described in section 1441. See paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of § 1.1441-3.
(d)
Covenant in trust deed.
Bonds issued under a trust deed containing a tax-free covenant are treated as if they contain such a covenant. If neither the bonds nor the trust deeds given by the obligor to secure them contained a tax-free covenant, but the original trust deeds were modified before January 1, 1934, by supplemental agreements containing a tax-free covenant executed by the obligor corporation and the trustee, the bonds issued before January 1, 1934, are subject to the provisions of section 1451, provided appropriate authority existed for the modification of the trust deeds in this manner. The authority must have been contained in the original trust deeds or actually secured from the bondholders.
(e)
Notation showing date of issue.
In order that the date of issue of bonds, mortgages, deeds of trust, or other similar corporate obligations containing a tax-free covenant may be readily determined by the owner for the purpose of preparing the ownership certificates required by § 1.1461-1, the issuing or debtor corporation shall indicate the date of issue by an appropriate notation, or use the phrase “issued on or after January 1, 1934,” on each such obligation or in a statement accompanying the delivery of the obligation.
(f)
Effect of withholding on income taxes of bondholder and issuing corporation
—(1)
Federal tax.
In the case of corporate bonds or other corporate obligations issued before January 1, 1934, and containing a tax-free covenant, the corporation paying a Federal tax, or any part of it, for someone else pursuant to its agreement is not entitled to deduct such payment from its gross income on any ground; nor shall the tax so paid be included in the gross income of the bondholder. The amount of the tax so paid may, nevertheless, be claimed by the bondholder in accordance with paragraph (a) of § 1.1462-1 as a credit against the total amount of income tax due. See also section 32. The tax so paid by the corporation upon tax-free covenant bond interest payable to a domestic or resident fiduciary and allocable to any nonresident alien beneficiary under section 652 or 662 is allowable, pro rata, as a credit against:
(i) The tax required to be withheld by the fiduciary in accordance with paragraph (f) of § 1.1441-3 from the income of the beneficiary, and
(ii) The total income tax computed in the return of the beneficiary, as indicated in paragraph (a) of § 1.1462-1.
(2)
State taxes.
In the case of corporate bonds or other obligations containing an appropriate tax-free covenant, the corporation paying for someone else, pursuant to its agreement, a State tax or any tax other than a Federal tax may deduct such payment as interest paid on indebtedness.
(g)
Alien resident of Puerto Rico.
For purposes of this section the term
“nonresident alien individual” includes an alien resident of Puerto Rico.
(h)
Other rules for withholding of tax under section 1451.
The rules for withholding stated in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3), (f), and (g) of § 1.1441-3 shall also apply for purposes of withholding the tax under this section.

Exemptions from withholding under section 1451.
(a)
Claiming personal exemptions.
Withholding under § 1.1451-1 from interest on bonds or other obligations of corporations issued before January 1, 1934, and containing a tax-free covenant shall not be required if there is filed with the withholding agent when presenting coupons for payment, or not later than February 1 of the following year, an ownership certificate on Form 1000 stating:
(1) In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, that his taxable income does not exceed his deductions for personal exemptions allowed under section 151; or
(2) In the case of an estate or trust the fiduciary of which is a citizen or resident of the United States, that its taxable income does not exceed the deduction for the personal exemption allowed under section 642(b).
(b)
Claiming residence in United States.

# Application of Withholding Provisions
§ 1.1461-1
Payment and returns of tax withheld.
(a)
Payment of withheld tax
—(1)
Deposits of tax.
Every withholding agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the regulations under such chapter shall deposit such amount of tax as provided in § 1.6302-2(a). If for any reason the total amount of tax required to be returned for any calendar year pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section has not been deposited pursuant to § 1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall pay the balance of tax due for such year at such place as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall specify. The tax shall be paid when filing the return required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for such year, unless the IRS specifies otherwise. With respect to withholding under section 1446, this section shall apply only to publicly traded partnerships and nominees that withhold under § 1.1446-4 and brokers and publicly traded partnerships that withhold (or are otherwise liable for underwithholding) under § 1.1446(f)-4 on transfers of publicly traded partnership interests. See § 1.1461-3 regarding withholding tax liabilities under sections 1446(a) and 1446(f) and penalties that apply for failure to withhold under either of those sections.
(2)
Penalties for failure to pay tax.
For penalties and additions to the tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Code, see sections 6656, 6672, and 7202 and the regulations under those sections.
(b)
Income tax return
—(1)
General rule.
A withholding agent shall make an income tax return on Form 1042 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) for income paid during the preceding calendar year that the withholding agent is required to report on an information return on Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. See section 6011 and § 1.6011-1(c). The withholding agent must file the return on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the income was paid. The return must show the aggregate amount of income paid and tax withheld required to be reported on all the Forms 1042-S for the preceding calendar year by the withholding agent, in addition to such information as is required by the form and accompanying instructions. See § 1.1474-1(c) for the requirement to show the aggregate chapter 4 reportable amounts and tax withheld on Form 1042. A single Form 1042 may be filed by
a withholding agent to report amounts under chapters 3 and 4, including tax withheld. Withholding certificates or other statements or information provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. A return must be filed under this paragraph (b)(1) even though no tax was required to be withheld during the preceding calendar year. The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for the applicable statute of limitations on assessments and collection with respect to the amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the applicable statute of limitations. Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld, as described in § 1.1461-2, shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form and accompanying instructions.
(2)
Amended returns.
An amended return may be filed on a Form 1042 or such other form as the IRS may prescribe. An amended return must include such information as the form or accompanying instructions shall require, including, with respect to any information that has changed from the time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the original return and the corrected information.
(c)
Information returns
—(1)
Filing requirement
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent (other than an individual who is not acting in the course of a trade or business with respect to a payment) must make an information return on Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report the amounts subject to reporting, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that were paid during the preceding calendar year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any person that withholds or is required to withhold an amount under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 or § 1.1446-4(a) (applicable to publicly traded partnerships required to pay tax under section 1446(a) on distributions) or § 1.1446(f)-4(a) (applicable to brokers required to withhold on transfers of publicly traded partnership interests) must file a Form 1042-S for the payment withheld upon whether or not that person is engaged in a trade or business and whether or not the payment is an amount subject to reporting. A Form 1042-S shall be prepared for each recipient of an amount subject to reporting and for each single type of income payment. The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and accompanying instructions prescribe. One copy of the Form 1042-S shall be filed with the IRS on or before March 15th of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid. It shall be filed with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions to the Form 1042-S and to the transmittal form. Withholding certificates, documentary evidence, or other statements or documentation provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the form. Another copy of the Form 1042-S must be furnished to the recipient for whom the form is prepared (or any other person, as required under this paragraph (c) or the instructions to the form) on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid. The withholding agent must retain a copy of each Form 1042-S for the statute of limitations on assessment and collection applicable to the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates. A withholding agent required by this section to furnish a recipient copy of Form 1042-S may furnish such copy electronically by complying with the requirements provided in § 1.6050W-2(a)(2) through (5) applicable to statements required under section 6050W (substituting the phrase “Form 1042-S” for the phrases “statement required under section 6050W” or “statements required by section 6050W(f)” each place they appear). A withholding agent that meets the requirements of that section for providing electronic copies to recipients may apply these rules to payments made in calendar year 2016.

Amounts subject to reporting
—(i)
In general.
Subject to the exceptions described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, amounts subject to reporting on Form 1042-S are amounts paid to a foreign payee or partner (including persons presumed to be foreign) that are amounts subject to withholding as defined in § 1.1441-2(a), distributions of effectively connected income under § 1.1446-4, or amounts realized from transfers of PTP interests under § 1.1446(f)-4. Amounts subject to reporting include amounts subject to withholding even if no amount is deducted and withheld from the payment because of a treaty or Internal Revenue Code exception to taxation or because an amount withheld was reimbursed to
the payee under the adjustment procedures of § 1.1461-2. In addition, amounts subject to reporting include any amounts paid to a foreign payee on which a withholding agent withheld (including under § 1.1441-2(e)(7)) an amount (either under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code or section 3406) whether or not the amount is subject to withholding. Amounts subject to reporting include, but are not limited to, the following items—
(A) The entire amount of a corporate distribution (whether actual or deemed) irrespective of any estimate of the portion of the distribution that represents a taxable dividend;

In the case of amounts paid on a notional principal contract described in § 1.1441-4(a)(3) that are presumed to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, the amount required to be reported is limited to the amount of cash paid from the notional principal contract;
(K) Scholarship, fellowship, or grant income and compensation for personal services that is not excludible from gross income under section 117 (whether or not the taxable scholarship, fellowship, grant income, or compensation for personal services is exempt from tax under an income tax treaty) paid to foreign students, trainees, teachers, or researchers;
(L) Dividend equivalents as described in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder;
(M) Any dividend or any payment that references a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction paid to a qualified derivatives dealer even when the withholding agent is not required to withhold on the payment pursuant to § 1.1441-1(b)(4)(xxi), (xxii), or (xxiii);
(N) Amounts paid to foreign governments, international organizations, or the Bank for International Settlements, whether or not documentation must be provided;

The amount to be reported is the amount of OID includible in the gross income of the holder of the obligation, if known, or, if not known, the total amount of original issue discount determined as if the holder held the obligation from its original issuance. A withholding agent may determine the total amount of OID by using the most recently published “List of Original Issue Discount Instruments,” (Publication 1212, available from the IRS Forms Distribution Centers);
(P) The amount of any distribution made by a publicly traded partnership that is an amount subject to withholding under § 1.1446-4, or that is paid to a qualified intermediary or a U.S. branch of a foreign person that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person;

(R) In the case of a broker that is a U.S. clearing organization—
(
1
) An amount realized (as determined under § 1.1446(f)-4(c)(2)(iii)) on a distribution made by a publicly traded
partnership for which withholding is required under § 1.1446(f)-4(a); and
(
2
) An amount realized on the sale of a PTP interest cleared and settled through a net settlement system maintained by the clearing organization acting as a central counterparty in the sale (with the reporting on the non-netted amount), unless an exception to withholding would apply under § 1.1446(f)-4(b)(2) or (3).

The information required to be furnished under this paragraph (c)(3) shall be based upon the information provided by or on behalf of the recipient of an amount subject to reporting (as corrected and supplemented based on the withholding agent's actual knowledge) or the presumption rules of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3), 1.1441-4(a), 1.1441-5(d) and (e), 1.1441-9(b)(3), 1.1446-1(c)(3) (as applied to publicly traded partnerships required to

The reference in the previous sentence to presumption rules applicable to withholding under section 1446 shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under § 1.1446-7. The Form 1042-S must include the following information, if applicable—
(i) The name, address, taxpayer identifying number of the withholding agent, and the withholding agent's status for chapter 3 purposes (based on the status codes applicable for chapter 3 purposes provided on the form);
(ii) A description of each category of income paid based on the income codes provided on the form (e.g., interest, dividends, royalties, etc.) and the aggregate amount in each category expressed in U.S. dollars;

(4)
Method of reporting
—(i)
Payments by U.S. withholding agents to recipients.
A withholding agent that is a U.S. person (other than a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is a qualified intermediary as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii) that makes payments of amounts subject to reporting on Form 1042-S must file a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient who receives such amount. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), a U.S. person includes a U.S. branch (including a territory financial institution) described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) that is treated as a U.S. person. Except as may otherwise be required on Form 1042-S or the instructions to the form, only payments for which the income code, exemption code, withholding rate, and recipient code are the same may be reported on a single Form 1042-S. See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for reporting of payments made to a person that is not a recipient. See § 1.1474-1(d)(4) for additional requirements that may apply for reporting on Form 1042-S with respect to a withholdable payment that is a chapter 4 reportable amount.
(A)
Payments to beneficial owners.
If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment directly to a beneficial owner it must complete Form 1042-S treating the beneficial owner as the recipient. Under the grace period rule of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv), a U.S. withholding agent may, under certain circumstances, treat a payee as a foreign person while the withholding agent awaits a valid withholding certificate. A U.S. withholding agent who relies on the grace period rule to treat a payee as a foreign person must file a Form 1042-S to report all payments on Form 1042-S during the period that person was presumed to be foreign even if that person is later determined to be a U.S. person based on appropriate documentation or is presumed to be a U.S. person after the grace period ends. In the case of joint owners, a withholding agent may provide a single Form 1042-S made out to the owner whose status the U.S. withholding agent relied upon to determine the applicable rate of withholding. If, however, any one of the owners requests its own Form 1042-S,
the withholding agent must furnish a Form 1042-S to the person who requests it. If more than one Form 1042-S is issued for a single payment, the aggregate amount paid and tax withheld that is reported on all Forms 1042-S cannot exceed the total amounts paid to joint owners and the tax withheld thereon.
(B)
Payments to a qualified intermediary, a withholding foreign partnership, or a withholding foreign trust.
A U.S. withholding agent that makes payments to a qualified intermediary (whether or not the qualified intermediary assumes primary withholding responsibility for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the Code), a withholding foreign partnership, or a withholding foreign trust shall complete Forms 1042-S treating the qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust as the recipient. The U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding rate pool with respect to each qualified intermediary. A qualified intermediary that does not assume primary withholding responsibility on all payments it receives provides information regarding the proportions of income subject to a particular withholding rate (
i.e.,
a chapter 3 withholding rate pool) to the withholding agent on a withholding statement associated with a qualified intermediary withholding certificate. In such a case, the U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding rate pool with respect to the qualified intermediary. To the extent a qualified intermediary is required to report a payment under chapter 61, it may provide a U.S. withholding agent with information regarding withholding rate pools for U.S. non-exempt recipients (as defined under § 1.1441-1(c)(21)). Amounts paid with respect to such withholding rate pools must be reported on a Form 1099 completed for each U.S. non-exempt recipient to the extent such U.S. non-exempt recipient is subject to Form 1099 reporting and is not reported on Form 1042-S. See, however, § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C) for when a qualified intermediary may provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S payees (in lieu of reporting such payees on a withholding statement) and for the withholding rate pools (including chapter 4 withholding rate pools) otherwise reportable on a withholding statement provided by a qualified intermediary.
(C)
Amounts paid to U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons.
A U.S. withholding agent making a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person (including a territory financial institution) described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) shall complete Form 1042-S as follows—
(
1
) If the branch has provided the U.S. withholding agent with a withholding certificate that evidences its agreement with the withholding agent to be treated as a U.S. person, the U.S. withholding agent files Forms 1042-S treating the U.S. branch or territory financial institution as the recipient;
(
2
) If the branch has provided the U.S. withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding beneficial owners, qualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, or other recipients, the U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient whose documentation is associated with the U.S. branch's or territory financial institution's withholding certificate; or
(
3
) If the U.S. withholding agent cannot reliably associate a payment with a valid withholding certificate from the U.S. branch, it shall treat the U.S. branch as the recipient and report the income as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States except as otherwise provided in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(B)(
4
).
(D)
Dual Claims.
A U.S. withholding agent may make a payment to a foreign entity that is simultaneously claiming a reduced rate of tax on its own behalf for a portion of the payment and a reduced rate on behalf of persons in their capacity as interest holders in that entity on the remaining portion. See § 1.1441-6(b)(2)(iii). If the claims are consistent and the withholding agent accepts the multiple claims, the withholding agent must file a separate Form 1042-S for those payments for which the entity is treated as the beneficial owner and Forms 1042-S for each of the interest holders in the
entity for which the interest holder is treated as the recipient. For those payments for which the interest holder in an entity is treated as the recipient, the U.S. withholding agent shall prepare the Form 1042-S in the same manner as a payment made to a nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity as set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. If the claims are consistent but the withholding agent has not chosen to accept the multiple claims, or if the claims are inconsistent, the withholding agent must file a separate Form 1042-S for the person or persons it has chosen to treat as the recipients.
(ii)
Payments made by U.S. withholding agents to persons that are not recipients
—(A)
Amounts paid to a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, and certain U.S. branches.
If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment to a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, or a U.S. branch (including a territory financial institution) described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) (other than a U.S. branch or territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person), it must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient to the extent the withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with valid documentation (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) from the recipient which is associated with the withholding certificate provided by the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch or territory financial institution. See § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(i) for when a withholding agent may report a chapter 4 reportable amount made to such an entity in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool. See also § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(A) for when a withholding statement provided by a nonqualified intermediary may include a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. If a payment is reported by the withholding agent in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool, the withholding agent must report on Form 1042-S the nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity as a recipient associated with the applicable chapter 4 withholding rate pool. If a payment is made through tiers of nonqualified intermediaries or flow-through entities, the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the recipient to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with documentation from the recipient. A withholding agent that is completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient that receives a payment through a nonqualified intermediary, a flow-through entity, or a U.S. branch or territory financial institution must include on the Form 1042-S the name of the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, U.S. branch or territory financial institution from which the recipient directly receives the payment. If a U.S. withholding agent cannot reliably associate the payment, or any portion of the payment, with valid documentation from a recipient either because no such documentation has been provided or because the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch or territory financial institution has failed to provide sufficient allocation information so that the withholding agent can associate the payment, or any portion thereof, with valid documentation, then the withholding agent must report the payments as made to an unknown recipient in accordance with the appropriate presumption rules for that payment. Thus, if the payment is not a withholdable payment and under the presumption rules the payment is presumed to be made to a foreign person, the withholding agent must generally withhold 30 percent of the payment and report the payment on Form 1042-S made out to an unknown recipient and shall also include the name of the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, U.S. branch or territory financial institution that received the payment on behalf of the unknown recipient. If, however, the recipient is presumed to be a U.S. non-exempt recipient (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(21)), the withholding agent must withhold on the payment as required under section 3406 and report the payment as required under chapter 61 of the Code. See § 1.1474-1(d)(4) for reporting requirements that apply to payments of chapter 4 reportable amounts paid to nonqualified intermediaries and flow-through entities. If, however, the payment is a withholdable payment, the
withholding agent must report the payment as made to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of nonparticipating FFIs in accordance with the presumption rule under § 1.1471-3(f)(5). For a payment to a foreign partnership on the transfer of a publicly traded partnership interest subject to § 1.1446(f)-4(a), see paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
8
) of this section (treating the foreign partnership as a recipient).
(B)
Disregarded entities.
If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment to a disregarded entity but receives a valid withholding certificate or other documentary evidence from a foreign person that is the single owner of a disregarded entity, the withholding agent must file a Form 1042-S treating the foreign single owner as the recipient. The taxpayer identifying number on the Form 1042-S, if required, must be the foreign single owner's TIN.
(iii)
Reporting by qualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, and withholding foreign trusts.
A qualified intermediary, a withholding foreign partnership, and a withholding foreign trust shall report payments on Form 1042-S as provided in their agreements with the IRS and the instructions to the form.
(iv)
Reporting by a nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, and certain U.S. branches.
A nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch (including a territory financial institution) described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(iv) (other than a U.S. branch or territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person) is a withholding agent and must file Forms 1042-S for amounts paid to recipients in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent. A Form 1042-S will not be required, however, if another withholding agent has reported the same amount for which the nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch would be required to file a return and the entire amount that should be withheld from such payment has been withheld (including withholding and reporting in accordance with the applicable presumption rule for the payment). A nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch must report payments made to recipients to the extent it has failed to provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent together with the information required for that withholding agent to reliably associate the payment with the recipient documentation or to the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld. A nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity that is required to report a payment on Form 1042-S must follow the same rules as apply to a U.S. withholding agent under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(v)
Pro rata reporting for allocation failures.
If a nonqualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch (including a territory financial institution) described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) (other than a U.S. branch or territory financial institution treated as a U.S. person) uses the alternative procedures of § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D) and fails to provide information sufficient to allocate the amount subject to reporting paid to a withholding rate pool to the payees identified for that pool, then the withholding agent shall report the payment in accordance with the rule provided in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D)(
6
).
(vi)
Other withholding agents.
Any person that is a withholding agent not described in paragraph (c)(4)(i), (iii), or (iv) of this section (e.g., a foreign person that is not a qualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch) shall file Form 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent and in accordance with the instructions to the form.
(d)
Report of taxpayer identifying numbers.
When so required under procedures that the IRS may prescribe in published guidance (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), a withholding agent must attach to the Form 1042 a list of all the taxpayer identifying numbers (and corresponding names) that have been furnished to the withholding agent and upon which the withholding agent has relied to grant a reduced rate of withholding and that are not otherwise required to be reported on a Form 1042-S under the provisions of this section.
(e)
Indemnification of withholding agent.
A withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any
tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter. A withholding agent that withholds based on a reasonable belief that such withholding is required under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter is treated for purposes of section 1461 and this paragraph (e) as having withheld tax in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter. In addition, a withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any payments made in accordance with the grace period provisions set forth in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv). This paragraph (e) does not apply to relieve a withholding agent from tax liability under chapter 3 of the Code or the regulations under that chapter.
(f)
Amounts paid not constituting gross income.
Any amount withheld in accordance with § 1.1441-3 shall be reported and paid in accordance with this section, even though the amount paid to the beneficial owner may not constitute gross income in whole or in part. For this purpose, a reference in this section and § 1.1461-2 to an amount shall, where appropriate, be deemed to refer to the amount subject to withholding under § 1.1441-3.
(g)
Extensions of time to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S.
The IRS may grant an extension of time in which to file a Form 1042 or a Form 1042-S. Form 2758, Application for Extension of Time to File Certain Excise, Income, Information, and Other Returns (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe), must be used to request an extension of time for a Form 1042. Form 8809, Request for Extension of Time to File Information Returns (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) must be used to request an extension of time for a Form 1042-S. The request must contain a statement of the reasons for requesting the extension and such other information as the forms or instructions may require. It must be mailed or delivered not later than March 15 of the year following the end of the calendar year for which the return will be filed.
(h)
Penalties.
For penalties and additions to the tax for failure to file returns or furnish statements in accordance with this section, see sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203, and the regulations under those sections.
(i)
Reporting in electronic form.
See §§ 301.6011-2(b) and 301.6011-15 of this chapter for the requirements of a withholding agent that is not a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042-S and 1042 in electronic form. See § 301.1474-1(a) of this chapter, which applies for purposes of this section to a withholding agent that is a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042 and 1042-S in electronic form.
(j)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to returns required to be filed for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2023. (For returns required to be filed for taxable years ending before December 31, 2023, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2022.)

§ 1.1461-2
Adjustments for overwithholding or underwithholding of tax.
(a)
Adjustments of overwithheld tax
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(1), a withholding agent that has overwithheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, and made a deposit of the tax as provided in § 1.6302-2(a), may adjust the overwithheld amount either pursuant to the reimbursement procedure described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or pursuant to the set-off procedure described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The rules in the preceding sentence do not apply to partnerships or nominees required to withhold under section 1446(a), other than on a distribution by a publicly traded partnership subject to withholding under § 1.1446-4(a) and a payment of an amount realized on the transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership subject to § 1.1446(f)-4.
(2)
Reimbursement of tax
—(i)
General rule.
Under the reimbursement procedure, the withholding agent repays the beneficial owner or payee for the amount of tax overwithheld. In such a case, the withholding agent may reimburse itself by reducing, by the amount of tax actually repaid to the beneficial owner or payee, the amount of any deposit of tax made by the withholding agent under § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii) for any subsequent payment period occurring before the end of the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding. Any such reduction that occurs for a payment period in the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding shall be allowed only if—
(A) The repayment to the beneficial owner or payee occurs before the earlier of the due date (not including extensions) for filing Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding or the date the Form 1042-S is actually filed with the IRS; and
(B) The withholding agent states on a timely filed (not including extensions) Form 1042 for the calendar year of overwithholding, that the filing of the Form 1042 constitutes a claim for credit in accordance with § 1.6414-1.
(ii)
Record maintenance.
If the beneficial owner is repaid an amount of withholding tax under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2), the withholding agent shall keep as part of its records a receipt showing the date and amount of repayment and the withholding agent must provide a copy of such receipt to the beneficial owner. For this purpose, a canceled check or an entry in a statement is sufficient provided that the check or statement contains a specific notation that it is a refund of tax overwithheld.
(3)
Set-offs.
Under the set-off procedure, the withholding agent may repay the beneficial owner or payee by applying the amount overwithheld against any amount which otherwise would be required under chapter 3 of the Code or the regulations thereunder to be withheld from income paid by the withholding agent to such person before the earlier of the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the Form 1042-S for the calendar year of overwithholding or the date that the Form 1042-S is actually filed with the IRS. For purposes of making a return on Form 1042 or 1042-S (or an amended form) for the calendar year of overwithholding and for purposes of making a deposit of the amount withheld, the reduced amount shall be considered the amount required to be withheld from such income under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) N is a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of the United Kingdom. In December 2001, a domestic corporation C pays a dividend of $100 to N, at which time C withholds $30 and remits the balance of $70 to N. On February 10, 2002, prior to the time that C files its Form 1042 and Form 1042-S with respect to the payment, N furnishes a valid Form W-8 described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) upon which C may rely to reduce the rate of withholding to 15% under the provisions of the U.S.-U.K. tax treaty. Consequently, N advises C that its tax liability is only $15 and not $30 and requests reimbursement of $15. Although C has already deposited the $30 that was withheld, as required by § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iv), C repays N in the amount of $15.
(ii) During 2001, C makes no other payments upon which tax is required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Code; accordingly, its return on Form 1042 for such year, which is filed on March 15, 2002, shows total tax withheld of $30, an adjusted total tax withheld of $15, and $30 previously paid for such year. Pursuant to § 1.6414-1(b), C claims a credit for the overpayment of $15 shown on the Form 1042 for 2001. Accordingly, it is permitted to reduce by $15 any deposit required by § 1.6302-2 to be made of tax withheld during the calendar year 2002. The Form 1042-S required to be filed by C with respect to the dividend of $100 paid to N in 2001 is required to show tax withheld under chapter 3 of $30 and tax repaid to N of $15.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
In addition, during 2002, C makes payments to N upon which it is required to withhold $200 under chapter 3 of the Code, all of which is withheld in June 2002. Pursuant to § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(iii), C deposits the amount of $185 on July 15, 2002 ($200 less the $15 for which credit is claimed on the Form 1042 for 2001). On March 15, 2003, C Corporation files its return on Form 1042 for calendar year 2002, which shows total tax withheld of $200, $185 previously deposited by C, and $15 allowable credit.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
Under § 1.6302-2(a)(1)(ii), C is required to deposit on a quarter-monthly basis the
tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Code. C withholds tax of $100 between February 8 and February 15, 2002, and deposits $75 [($100 × 90%) less $15] of the withheld tax within 3 banking days after February 15, 2002, and by depositing $10 [($100−$15) less $75] within 3 banking days after March 15, 2002.
(b)
Withholding of additional tax when underwithholding occurs.
A withholding agent may withhold from future payments (including distributions of effectively connected income subject to withholding under § 1.1446-4 and the amount realized from the transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership subject to § 1.1446(f)-4) made to a beneficial owner the tax that should have been withheld from previous payments to that beneficial owner under chapter 3 of the Code. In the alternative, the withholding agent may satisfy the tax from property that it holds in custody for the beneficial owner or property over which it has control. Such additional withholding or satisfaction of the tax owed may only be made before the date that the Form 1042 is required to be filed (not including extensions) for the calendar year in which the underwithholding occurred. See § 1.6302-2 for making deposits of tax or § 1.1461-1(a) for making payment of the balance due for a calendar year. See also §§ 1.1461-1, 1.1461-3, and 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7 for rules relating to withholding under section 1446.
(c)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, the term
payment period
means the period for which the withholding agent is required by § 1.6302-2(a)(1) to make a deposit of tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Code.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to payments made on or after January 1, 2022. For payments made before January 1, 2022, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2020.
[T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53470, Oct. 14, 1997, as amended by T.D. 8804, 63 FR 72188, Dec. 31, 1998; T.D. 8856, 64 FR 73412, Dec. 30, 1999; T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28741, May 18, 2005; T.D. 9658, 79 FR 12792, Mar. 6, 2014; T.D. 9808, 82 FR 2105, Jan. 6, 2017; T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76946, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1461-3
Withholding under section 1446.
For rules relating to the withholding tax liability of a partnership, nominee, or transferee under section 1446, see §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7 and 1.1446(f)-1 through 1.1446(f)-5. For interest, penalties, and additions to the tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be paid under section 1446, see sections 6601, 6651, 6655 (in the case of publicly traded partnerships, see section 6656), 6672, and 7202 and the regulations under those sections. For additional penalties and additions to the tax for failure to comply with the regulations under section 1446, see sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203, and the regulations under those sections. The references in this section to §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7 apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under § 1.1446-7, and the references in this section to §§ 1.1446(f)-1 through 1.1446(f)-5 shall apply with respect to returns for transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021.
[T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28741, May 18, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76946, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.1462-1
Withheld tax as credit to recipient of income.
(a)
Creditable tax.
The entire amount of the income from which the tax is required to be withheld (including amounts calculated under the gross-up formula in § 1.1441-3(f)(1)) shall be included in gross income in the return required to be made by the beneficial owner of the income, without deduction for the amount required to be or actually withheld, but the amount of tax actually withheld shall be allowed as a credit against the total income tax computed in the beneficial owner's return.
(b)
Amounts paid to persons who are not the beneficial owner.
Amounts withheld at source under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code on payments to (or effectively connected taxable income allocable to) a fiduciary, partnership, or intermediary are deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer ultimately liable for the tax upon such income. Thus, for example, if a beneficiary of a trust is subject to the taxes imposed by section 1, 2, 3, or 11 upon any portion of the income received
from a foreign trust, the part of any amount withheld at source which is properly allocable to the income so taxed to such beneficiary shall be credited against the amount of the income tax computed upon the beneficiary's return, and any excess shall be refunded. See § 1.1446-3 for examples applying this rule in the context of a partnership interest held by a foreign trust or estate. Further, if a partnership withholds an amount under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the allocable share of a partner that is a partnership (upper-tier partnership) or with respect to the allocable share of partners in an upper-tier partnership, such amount is deemed to have been withheld by the upper-tier partnership. See § 1.1446-5 for rules applicable to tiered partnership structures. References in this paragraph (b) to withholding under section 1446 shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under § 1.1446-7.
(c)
Effective date.
Unless otherwise provided in this section, this section applies to payments made after December 31, 2000.
[T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53471, Oct. 14, 1997, as amended by T.D. 8804, 63 FR 72188, Dec. 31, 1998; T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28741, May 18, 2005]
§ 1.1463-1
Tax paid by recipient of income.
(a)
Tax paid.
If the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code is paid by the beneficial owner of the income or by the withholding agent, it shall not be re-collected from the other, regardless of the original liability therefor. However, this section does not relieve the person that did not withhold tax from liability for interest or any penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable. See § 1.1441-7(b) for additional applicable rules. See §§ 1.1446-3(e) and (f) and 1.1446(f)-5(a) for application of the rule of this paragraph (a), and for additional rules, in which the withholding tax was required to be paid under section 1446. The references in the previous sentence to § 1.1446-3(e) and (f) apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under § 1.1446-7, and the reference in the previous sentence to § 1.1446(f)-5(a) shall apply to the tax required to be withheld under section 1446(f) for transfers that occur on or after January 29, 2021.
(b)
Effective date.
Unless otherwise provided in this section, this section applies to failures to withhold occurring after December 31, 2000.

(a)
In general.
The refund or credit under chapter 65 of the Code of an overpayment of tax which has actually been withheld at the source under chapter 3 of the Code shall be made to the taxpayer from whose income the amount of such tax was in fact withheld. To the extent that the overpayment under chapter 3 was not in fact withheld at the source, but was paid, by the withholding agent the refund or credit under chapter 65 of the overpayment shall be made to the withholding agent. Thus, where a debtor corporation assumes liability pursuant to its tax-free covenant for the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 upon interest and pays the tax in behalf of its bondholder, and it can be shown that the bondholder is not in fact liable for any tax, the overpayment of tax shall be credited or refunded to the withholding agent in accordance with chapter 65 since the tax was not actually deducted and withheld from the interest paid to the bondholder. In further illustration, where a withholding agent who is required by chapter 3 to withhold $300 tax from rents paid to a nonresident alien individual mistakenly withholds $320 and mistakenly pays $350 as internal revenue tax, the amount of $30 shall be credited or refunded to the withholding agent in accordance with chapter 65 and the amount of $20 shall be credited or refunded in accordance with such chapter to the person from whose income such
amount has been withheld. With respect to section 1446(a), this section applies only to a publicly traded partnership or nominee described in § 1.1446-4 and, with respect to section 1446(f), only to a publicly traded partnership or broker described in § 1.1446(f)-4.
(b)
Tax repaid to payee.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6414-1, any amount of tax withheld under chapter 3 of the Code, which, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1461-2, is repaid by the withholding agent to the person from whose income such amount was erroneously withheld shall be considered as tax which, within the meaning of sections 1464 and 6414, was not actually withheld by the withholding agent.
(c)
Applicability date.
The last sentence of paragraph (a) of this section applies to nominees and publicly traded partnerships described in § 1.1446-4 for partnership taxable years beginning after April 29, 2008, and to brokers required to withhold and publicly traded partnerships liable for underwithholding under § 1.1446(f)-4 on transfers that occur on or after January 1, 2022.

Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this paragraph (b)(104)(i), a preexisting obligation includes an obligation held by an entity that is issued, opened, or executed on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, by or with a withholding agent or FFI that treats the obligation as a preexisting obligation. See §§ 1.1471-2(a)(4)(ii), 1.1472-1(b)(2), and 1.1471-4(c)(3) for the due diligence requirements applicable to preexisting obligations for withholding agents and participating FFIs.

(B) The withholding agent (and, as applicable, the member of the withholding agent's expanded affiliated
group or sponsored FFI group) treats both of the aforementioned obligations, and any other obligations of the payee or account holder that are treated as preexisting obligations under this paragraph (b)(104)(ii), as consolidated obligations; and
(C) With respect to an obligation that is subject to AML due diligence, the withholding agent is permitted to satisfy such AML due diligence for the obligation by relying upon the AML due diligence performed for the preexisting obligation described in paragraph (b)(104)(i) of this section.

§ 1.1471-2
Requirement to deduct and withhold tax on withholdable payments to certain FFIs.
(a)
Requirement to withhold on payments to FFIs
—(1)
General rule of withholding.
Under section 1471(a), notwithstanding any exemption from withholding under any other provision of the Code or regulations, a withholding agent must withhold 30 percent of any withholdable payment made after June 30, 2014, to a payee that is an FFI unless either the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with documentation upon which it is permitted to rely to treat the payment as exempt from withholding under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the payment is made under a grandfathered obligation that is described in paragraph (b) of this section or constitutes gross proceeds from the disposition of such an obligation. A withholding agent that is making a payment must determine who the payee is under § 1.1471-3(a) with respect to that payment and the chapter 4 status of such payee. See § 1.1471-3 for requirements for determining the chapter 4 status of a payee, including additional documentation requirements that apply when a payment is made to an intermediary or flow-through entity that is not the payee. Withholding under this section applies without regard to whether the payee receives a withholdable payment as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary. See paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section for a description of the withholding requirements imposed on territory financial institutions as withholding agents under chapter 4. In the case of a withholdable payment to a NFFE, a withholding agent is required to determine whether withholding applies under section 1472 and § 1.1472-1. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under chapter 4, a withholding obligation arises on the date a payment is made, as determined under § 1.1473-1(a).
(2)
Special withholding rules
—(i)
Requirement to withhold on payments of U.S. source FDAP income to participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs that are NQIs, NWPs, or NWTs, and U.S. branches acting as intermediaries.
A withholding agent that, after June 30, 2014, makes a
payment of U.S. source FDAP income to a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI receiving the payment as an intermediary, or a NWP or NWT, must withhold 30 percent of the payment unless the withholding is reduced under this paragraph (a)(2)(i). A withholding agent is not required to withhold on a payment, or portion of a payment, that it can reliably associate, in the manner described in § 1.1471-3(c)(2), with a valid intermediary or flow-through withholding certificate that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(d)(4) and a withholding statement that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B) and that allocates the payment or portion of the payment to payees for which no withholding is required under chapter 4. Further, a withholding agent is not required to withhold on a payment that it can reliably associate with documentation indicating that the payee is a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(135)) or is a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person but that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C). See also § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(H) for the rules for valid documentation of a U.S. branch.
(ii)
Residual withholding responsibility of intermediaries and flow-through entities.
An intermediary or flow-through entity that receives a withholdable payment after June 30, 2014, is required to withhold on such payment to the extent required under chapter 4. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an intermediary or flow-through entity is not required to withhold if another withholding agent has withheld the full amount required. Further, an NQI, NWP, or NWT is not required to withhold with respect to a withholdable payment under chapter 4 if it has provided a valid intermediary withholding certificate or flow-through withholding certificate and all of the information required by § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii), and it does not know, and has no reason to know, that another withholding agent failed to withhold the correct amount. A QI's, WP's, or WT's obligation to withhold and report is determined in accordance with its QI agreement, WP agreement, or WT agreement.
(iii)
Requirement to withhold if a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI makes an election to be withheld upon.
A person that otherwise would be a payee with respect to a payment but that makes an election to be withheld upon does not agree to accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment under chapter 3 or 4. Accordingly, such person cannot be treated as the payee and the withholding agent must determine whether it must withhold based on the chapter 4 status of the payee on whose behalf the person is receiving the payment. The election to be withheld upon is only available to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section. The election is not available to an entity that is required to accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment, such as a WP or WT receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, or an entity that already must be withheld upon because it may not accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment and, as such, already must pass up documentation with respect to the payee to the withholding agent, such as a participating FFI that is an NQI receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income.
(A)
Election to be withheld upon for U.S. source FDAP income.
A withholding agent is required to withhold with respect to a payment, or portion of a payment, that is U.S. source FDAP income subject to withholding that is made after June 30, 2014, to a QI that has elected in accordance with this paragraph to be withheld upon, unless such withholding agent also makes an election to be withheld upon under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) or is an FFI that may not accept primary withholding responsibility for the payment. In such case, the withholding agent must withhold 30 percent of the portion of the payment that is allocable, pursuant to a withholding statement described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B) provided by the QI, to recalcitrant account holders and nonparticipating FFIs. If no such allocation information is provided, the withholding agent must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) to determine the chapter 4 status of the payee. A QI that is an FFI and that makes the election to be withheld
upon with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income may not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 for that payment. Conversely, a QI that is an FFI and that does not make the election to be withheld upon with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income is required to assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 for that payment. The election to be withheld upon is only available with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income if—
(
1
) The withholding agent is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, QI, or a U.S. withholding agent;
(
2
) The person who receives the payment is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that acts as a QI with respect to the payment;
(
3
) The person who receives the payment provides the withholding agent, at or before the time of the payment, with a valid intermediary withholding certificate with respect to the payment that notifies the withholding agent that it has elected to be withheld upon, certifies that it is not assuming primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3, and designates whether such election is made for all accounts held with the withholding agent or for the specific accounts identified on the withholding certificate; and
(
4
) The intermediary withholding certificate is accompanied by a withholding statement described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B).
(B)
Election to be withheld upon for gross proceeds.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Withholding obligation of a territory financial institution.
A territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment has an obligation to withhold (to the extent required under this section and § 1.1472-1(b)) if it agrees to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment for purposes of both chapter 4 and § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A). A territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment is not required to withhold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or § 1.1472-1(b), however, if it has provided the withholding agent that is a U.S. withholding agent, participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or QI with all of the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii) (in which it has not agreed to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment), and it does not know, or have reason to know, that another withholding agent failed to withhold the correct amount or failed to report the payment correctly under § 1.1474-1(d).
(v)
Withholding obligation of a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution.
A foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution is a U.S. withholding agent and a payee that is a U.S. person, and is generally not an FFI. However, a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution that is also a reporting Model 1 FFI is both a withholding agent and a registered deemed-compliant FFI. Additionally, a QI branch of a U.S. financial institution is both a withholding agent and either a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI. Therefore, a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 but has an obligation to withhold under this section and § 1.1472-1 and may be liable for the tax if it fails to do so. See § 1.1471-2(a) (requirement to withhold on payments to FFIs) and § 1.1471-3(a)(3)(iii) (U.S. intermediary or agent of a foreign person). A foreign branch that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or a reporting Model 2 FFI may apply the procedures under Annex I of an applicable IGA to document the chapter 4 status of a payee of a withholdable payment that is a holder of an account maintained by the branch in the Model 1 or Model 2 IGA jurisdiction. A QI branch of a U.S. financial institution must withhold in accordance with this chapter as provided in the QI agreement in addition to meeting its obligations under either § 1.1471-4(b) and its FFI agreement or § 1.1471-5(f).
(vi)
Payments of gross proceeds.
[Reserved]
(3)
Coordination of withholding under sections 1471(a) and (b).
The following entities are deemed to satisfy their withholding obligations under section 1471(a) and this section: participating FFIs that comply with the withholding requirements of § 1.1471-4(b); exempt
beneficial owners; section 501(c) entities described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(v); and nonprofit organizations described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(vi). See § 1.1471-5(f) for when a deemed-compliant FFI is deemed to satisfy its withholding obligations under section 1471(a) and this section.
(4)
Payments for which no withholding is required.
A withholding agent that has determined, in accordance with the documentation requirements and other rules provided in § 1.1471-3, that the payee of a withholdable payment is a foreign entity must determine whether the payment is exempt from withholding. Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (viii) of this section describe the circumstances in which a withholdable payment is not subject to withholding under section 1471(a) and this section.
(i)
Exception to withholding if the withholding agent lacks control, custody, or knowledge
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent that is not related to the payee or beneficial owner has an obligation to withhold under chapter 4 only to the extent that, at any time between the date that the obligation to withhold would arise (but for the provisions of this paragraph (a)(4)(i)) and the due date for filing the return on Form 1042 (including extensions) for the year in which the payment occurs, it has control over or custody of money or property owned by the payee or beneficial owner from which to withhold an amount and has knowledge of the facts that give rise to the payment. The exemption from the obligation to withhold under this paragraph (a)(4)(i) does not apply, however, to payments with respect to stock or other securities or if the lack of control or custody of money or property from which to withhold is part of a pre-arranged plan known to the withholding agent to avoid withholding under section 1471 or 1472. A withholding agent does not lack control over money or property for purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(i) if the withholding agent directs another party to make the payment. Thus, for example, a principal does not cease to have control over a payment when it contracts with a paying agent to make the payments to its account holders in lieu of paying the account holders directly. Further, a withholding agent does not lack knowledge of the facts that give rise to a payment merely because the withholding agent does not know the character or source of the payment for U.S. tax purposes. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for rules addressing a withholding agent's obligations when the withholding agent has knowledge of the facts that give rise to the payment, but the character or source of the payment is not known. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(i), a withholding agent is related to the payee or beneficial owner if it is related within the meaning of section 482. Any exemption from withholding pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4)(i) applies without a requirement that documentation be furnished to the withholding agent. The special rules set forth in § 1.1441-2(d)(2) through (4), regarding the obligation of a withholding agent with respect to cancellation of debt, the satisfaction of a tax liability following underwithholding by a withholding agent, and amounts described in § 1.860G-3(b)(1) (regarding certain partnership allocations of REMIC net income with respect to a REMIC residual interest) also apply for purposes of chapter 4.
(B)
Example.
A, an individual, owns stock in DC, a domestic corporation, through a custodian, Bank 1, that is a participating FFI. A also has a money market account at Bank 2, which is also a participating FFI. DC pays a dividend of $1,000 that is deposited in A's custodial account at Bank 1. A then directs Bank 1 to transfer $1,000 to A's money market account at Bank 2. With respect to the payment of the dividend into A's custodial account with Bank 1, both DC and Bank 1 are withholding agents making a withholdable payment for which they have custody, control, and knowledge. See § 1.1473-1(a)(2)(vii)(B) and (d). Therefore, both DC and Bank 1 have an obligation to withhold on the payment unless they can reliably associate the payment with documentation sufficient to treat the respective payees as not subject to withholding under chapter 4. With respect to the wire transfer of $1,000 from A's account at Bank 1 to A's account at Bank 2, neither Bank 1 nor Bank 2 is required to withhold with respect to the transfer because neither bank has
knowledge of the facts that gave rise to the payment. Even though Bank 1 is a custodian with respect to A's interest in DC and has knowledge regarding the $1,000 dividend paid to A, once Bank 1 credits the $1,000 dividend to A's account, the $1,000 becomes A's property. When A transfers the $1,000 to its account at Bank 2, this constitutes a separate payment about which Bank 1 has no knowledge regarding the type of payment made. Further, Bank 2 only has knowledge that it receives $1,000 to be credited to A's account but has no knowledge regarding the type of payment made. Accordingly, Bank 1 and Bank 2 have no withholding obligation with respect to the transfer from A's custodial account at Bank 1 to A's money market account at Bank 2.
(ii)
Exception to withholding for certain payments made prior to July 1, 2016 (transitional)
—(A)
In general.
For any withholdable payment made prior to July 1, 2016, with respect to a preexisting obligation for which a withholding agent does not have documentation indicating the payee's status as a nonparticipating FFI, the withholding agent is not required to withhold under this section and section 1471(a) unless the payee is a prima facie FFI.
(B)
Prima facie FFIs.
If the payee is a prima facie FFI, the withholding agent must treat the payee as a nonparticipating FFI beginning on January 1, 2015, until the date the withholding agent obtains documentation sufficient to establish a different chapter 4 status of the payee. A prima facie FFI means any payee if—
(
1
) The withholding agent has available as part of its electronically searchable information a designation for the payee as a QI or NQI; or
(
2
) For an account maintained in the United States, the payee is presumed to be a foreign entity under § 1.1471-3(f) or is documented as a foreign entity for purposes of chapter 3 or 61, and the withholding agent has recorded as part of its electronically searchable information one of the following North American Industry Classification System or Standard Industrial Classification codes indicating that the payee is a financial institution:
(
i
) Commercial Banking (NAICS 522110).
(
ii
) Savings Institutions (NAICS 522120).
(
iii
) Credit Unions (NAICS 522130).
(
iv

(iii)
Payments to a participating FFI.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a withholding agent is not required to withhold under section 1471(a) and this section on a withholdable payment made to a payee that the withholding agent can treat as a participating FFI in accordance with § 1.1471-3(d)(4). For this purpose, a limited branch of a participating FFI is treated as a nonparticipating FFI.
(iv)
Payments to a deemed-compliant FFI.
Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (iii) of this section, a withholding agent is not required to withhold under section 1471(a) and this section on a withholdable payment made to a payee that the withholding agent can treat as a deemed-compliant FFI in accordance
with § 1.1471-3(d)(4) through (7). For this purpose, a limited branch of a deemed-compliant FFI is treated as a nonparticipating FFI.
(v)
Payments to an exempt beneficial owner.
A withholding agent is not required to withhold under section 1471(a) and this section on a withholdable payment to the extent that the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with documentation to determine the portion of the payment that is allocable to an exempt beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1471-3(d)(8). For example, a withholding agent is not required to withhold under this section on a withholdable payment made to a payee that is an exempt beneficial owner with respect to the payment, to a nonparticipating FFI to the extent that the nonparticipating FFI receives the payment as an intermediary on behalf of one or more of its account holders that are exempt beneficial owners, or to a flow-through entity to the extent that the flow-through entity receives the payment with respect to one or more of its partners, beneficiaries, or owners (as applicable) that are exempt beneficial owners. See § 1.1471-3(d)(8)(ii) for special rules for a withholding agent to determine the portion of a withholdable payment that is beneficially owned by an exempt beneficial owner in the case of a payment made to a nonparticipating FFI.
(vi)
Payments to a territory financial institution.
A withholding agent is not required to withhold under section 1471(a) and this section on a withholdable payment made to a payee that the withholding agent can treat as a territory financial institution that beneficially owns the payment in accordance with § 1.1471-3(d)(10)(i). A withholding agent also is not required to withhold under this section on a withholdable payment that the withholding agent can treat, in accordance with § 1.1471-3(d)(10)(ii), as made to a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to the payment and that has agreed to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of chapters 3 and 4 with respect to the payment. A territory financial institution's agreement to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of this section must be evidenced by a withholding certificate described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(F) furnished by the territory financial institution to the withholding agent.
(vii)
Payments to an account held with a clearing organization with FATCA-compliant membership.
[Reserved]
(viii)
Payments to certain excepted accounts.
A withholding agent is not required to withhold under chapter 4 on a withholdable payment made to an account described in § 1.1471-5(b)(2).
(5)
Withholding requirements if source or character of payment is unknown
—(i)
General rule.
If a withholding agent has knowledge of the facts that give rise to a payment but is unable to determine at the time of payment the character of the payment sufficiently to determine whether it is a withholdable payment, such payment must be treated as a withholdable payment. If a withholding agent has knowledge of the facts that give rise to a payment but is unable to determine at the time of payment the source of the payment, such payment must be treated as U.S. source income. For example, if a withholding agent does not know at the time of payment the amount of the payment that is a withholdable payment, because that calculation depends on facts that are not known at the time of payment (for example, because the withholding agent does not know whether services were performed in the United States or whether the payment constitutes income to the recipient) the withholding agent must withhold an amount necessary to ensure that the amount withheld is not less than 30 percent of the amount that could be a withholdable payment, subject to the limitation that the withheld amount must not exceed 30 percent of the amount paid. Notwithstanding this paragraph (a)(5), a withholding agent may presume a payment to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and thus, not a withholdable payment, if it can do so under § 1.1471-3(f)(6) (regarding payments to certain U.S. branches).
(ii)
Optional escrow procedure.
With respect to a payment described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the withholding agent may elect to retain 30 percent of the payment to hold in escrow until the earlier of the date that the amount of the withholdable payment can be determined or one year from the date the amount is placed in escrow, at which time either the withholding becomes due under this section or, to the extent that it is determined that the payment is of a type for which no withholding is required, the escrowed amount must be paid to the payee.
(b)
Grandfathered obligations
—(1)
Grandfathered treatment of outstanding obligations.
Notwithstanding § 1.1473-1(a), a withholdable payment does not include any payment made under a grandfathered obligation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, or any gross proceeds from the disposition of such an obligation. Notwithstanding § 1.1471-5(h), a foreign passthru payment does not include any payment made under a grandfathered obligation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, or any gross proceeds from the disposition of such an obligation. A premium paid with regard to an insurance contract or annuity contract that is a grandfathered obligation is treated as a payment made under a grandfathered obligation.
(2)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply solely for purposes of this paragraph (b).
(i)
Grandfathered obligation
—(A) The term
grandfathered obligation
means—
(
1
) Any obligation outstanding on July 1, 2014;
(
2
) Any obligation that gives rise to a withholdable payment solely because the obligation is treated as giving rise to a dividend equivalent pursuant to section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder, provided that the obligation is executed on or before the date that is six months after the date on which obligations of its type are first treated as giving rise to dividend equivalents;
(
3
) Any agreement requiring a secured party to make a payment with respect to, or to repay, collateral posted to secure a grandfathered obligation. If collateral (or a pool of collateral) secures both grandfathered obligations and obligations that are not grandfathered, the collateral posted to secure the grandfathered obligations may be determined by allocating (pro rata by value) the collateral (or each item comprising the pool of collateral) to all outstanding obligations secured by the collateral (or pool of collateral) or, if the collateral cannot be allocated pro rata to all obligations, by allocating all collateral to obligations that are not grandfathered and withholding to the extent required under chapter 4; and
(
4
) Any obligation that gives rise to substitute interest (as defined in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) that arises from the payee posting a grandfathered obligation described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section as collateral.
(B) Solely for purposes of a foreign passthru payment, the term
grandfathered obligation
also includes any obligation that is executed on or before the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the
Federal Register.
(ii)
Obligation
—(A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the term
obligation
means any legally binding agreement or instrument. An obligation for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) includes, for example—
(
1
) A debt instrument (for example, a bond, guaranteed investment certificate, or term deposit);
(
2
) An agreement to extend credit for a fixed term (for example, a line of credit or a revolving credit facility), provided that the agreement as of its issue date fixes the material terms (including a stated maturity date) under which the credit will be provided;
(
3
) A derivatives transaction entered into between counterparties under an ISDA Master Agreement that is evidenced by a confirmation;
(
4
) A life insurance contract under which the entire contract value is payable no later than upon the death of the individual(s) insured under the contract but, in the case of a life insurance contract that contains a provision that
permits the substitution of a new individual as the insured under the contract, only until a substitution occurs; and
(
5
) An immediate annuity contract payable for a period certain or for the life of the annuitant.
(B) An
obligation
for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not include any legal agreement or instrument that—
(
1
) Is treated as equity for U.S. tax purposes;
(
2
) Lacks a stated expiration or term (for example, a savings deposit or demand deposit, a deferred annuity contract, or an annuity contract that permits a substitution of a new individual as the annuitant under the contract);
(
3
) Is a brokerage agreement, custodial agreement, investment linked insurance contract, investment linked annuity contract, or similar agreement to hold financial assets for the account of others and to make and receive payments of income and other amounts with respect to such assets; or
(
4
) Is a master agreement that merely sets forth standard terms and conditions that are intended to apply to a series of transactions between parties but that does not set forth all of the specific terms necessary to conclude a particular transaction.
(iii)
Date outstanding.
Except as provided in the following sentence, an obligation that constitutes indebtedness for U.S. tax purposes is outstanding on the date provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) if it has an issue date before such date. In all other cases, including an agreement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, an obligation is outstanding on the date provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) if a legally binding agreement establishing the obligation was executed between the parties to the agreement before such date. Any material modification of an outstanding obligation will result in the obligation being treated as newly issued or executed as of the effective date of such modification.
(iv)
Material modification.
In the case of an obligation that constitutes indebtedness for U.S. tax purposes, a material modification is any significant modification of the debt instrument as defined in § 1.1001-3(e). For life insurance contracts, a material modification includes any substitution of the insured under the contract. In all other cases, whether a modification of an obligation is material is determined based on the facts and circumstances.
(3)
Application to flow-through entities
—(i)
Partnerships.
A payment made under a grandfathered obligation includes a payment made to a partnership with respect to such obligation and a payment made with respect to a partnership's disposition of such obligation. A payment made under a grandfathered obligation also includes the income from such obligation that is includible in the gross income of a partner with respect to a capital or profits interest in the partnership and the gross proceeds allocated to a partner from the disposition of such obligation as determined under § 1.1473-1(a)(5)(vii).
(ii)
Simple trusts.
A payment made under a grandfathered obligation includes a payment made to a simple trust with respect to such obligation, including a payment made with respect to a simple trust's disposition of such obligation. A payment made under a grandfathered obligation also includes income from such obligation that is includible in the income of a beneficiary and further includes a beneficiary's share of the gross proceeds from a disposition of such obligation as determined under § 1.1473-1(a)(5)(vii).
(iii)
Grantor trusts.
A payment made under a grandfathered obligation includes a payment made to a grantor trust with respect to such obligation, including a payment made with respect to the trust's disposition of such obligation. A payment made under a grandfathered obligation also includes income from such obligation that is includible in the gross income of a person that is treated as an owner of the trust and the gross proceeds from the disposition of such obligation to the extent such owner is treated as owning the portion of the trust that consists of the obligation.
(4)
Determination by withholding agent of grandfathered treatment
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent other than the issuer of the obligation (or agent of the issuer) may, absent actual knowledge, rely on a written statement by
the issuer of the obligation to determine if such obligation meets the requirements for grandfathered treatment provided under this paragraph (b).
(ii)
Determination of material modification.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section (defining material modification), a withholding agent, other than the issuer of the obligation (or an agent of the issuer), is required to treat a modification of the obligation as material only if the withholding agent has actual knowledge thereof, such as in the event the withholding agent receives a disclosure indicating that there has been or will be a material modification to such obligation. The issuer of the obligation (or an agent of the issuer) that is a withholding agent is required to treat a modification of the obligation as material if the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that a material modification has occurred with respect to the obligation.
(iii)
Record retention.
A withholding agent that relies on a document provided by the issuer of an obligation as described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section must retain such document in its records for the applicable period of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to amounts paid under the obligation or from disposition of the obligation.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on January 6, 2017. However, taxpayers may apply these provisions as of January 28, 2013. (For the rules that apply beginning on January 28, 2013, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2016.)
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5911, Jan. 28, 2013; 78 FR 55203, Sept. 10, 2013, as amended by T.D. 9657, 79 FR 12828, Mar. 6, 2014; 79 FR 37176, July 1, 2014; T.D. 9809, 82 FR 2150, Jan. 6, 2017; 82 FR 29729, June 30, 2017]
§ 1.1471-3
Identification of payee.
(a)
Payee defined
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), for purposes of chapter 4 a payee is the person to whom a payment is made, regardless of whether such person is the beneficial owner of the amount.
(2)
Payee with respect to a financial account.
For purposes of payments made to a financial account and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the payee is the holder of the financial account.
(3)
Exceptions
—(i)
Certain foreign agents or intermediaries
—(A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and (vi) of this section (applicable to territory financial institutions and certain U.S. branches), a foreign person that is acting as an agent or intermediary with respect to a payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not the payee if such foreign person is—
(
1
) An NFFE, unless the NFFE is a QI that has assumed primary withholding responsibility; or
(
2
) In the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or restricted distributor, unless the participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or restricted distributor is a QI that has assumed primary withholding responsibility.
(B) In the case of an agent or intermediary described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the payee is the person or persons for whom the agent or intermediary collects the payment. Thus, for example, the payee of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income that the withholding agent can reliably associate with a withholding certificate from a QI that does not assume primary withholding responsibility with respect to the payment under chapter 3, or a payment to a participating FFI that is an NQI, is the person or persons for whom the QI or NQI acts.
(ii)
Foreign flow-through entity
—(A) A foreign entity that is a flow-through entity is a payee with respect to a payment only if the flow-through entity is—
(
1
) An FFI that is not a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI, or restricted distributor receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income;
(
2
) An excepted NFFE that is not acting as an agent or intermediary with respect to the payment;
(
3
) A WP or WT that is not acting as an agent or intermediary with respect to the payment; or
(
4
) Receiving income that is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or receiving a payment of gross proceeds from the sale of property that can produce income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and that is excluded from the definition of a withholdable payment under § 1.1473-1(a)(4).
(B) A withholding agent that makes a withholdable payment to a flow-through entity that is not described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section will be required to treat the partner, beneficiary, or owner (as applicable) as the payee (looking through partners, beneficiaries, and owners that are themselves flow-through entities that are not described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (
3
)).
(iii)
U.S. intermediary or agent of a foreign person.
A withholding agent that makes a withholdable payment to a U.S. person and has actual knowledge that the person receiving the payment is acting as an intermediary or agent of a foreign person with respect to the payment must treat such foreign person, and not the intermediary or agent, as the payee of such payment. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a withholding agent that makes a withholdable payment to a U.S. financial institution or a U.S. insurance broker (to the extent such withholdable payment is a payment of premiums) that is acting as an intermediary or agent with respect to the payment on behalf of one or more foreign persons may treat the U.S. financial institution or U.S. insurance broker as the payee if the withholding agent does not have reason to know that the U.S. financial institution or U.S. insurance broker will not comply with its obligations to withhold under sections 1471 and 1472.
(iv)
Territory financial institution.
A withholding agent that makes a withholdable payment to a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary or agent with respect to the payment may treat the territory financial institution as the payee only if the territory financial institution has agreed (as evidenced by a withholding certificate described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A) and (F) of this section) to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4. In all other cases, the withholding agent must treat as the payee the partner, beneficiary, or owner (as applicable) of the territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity (looking through partners, beneficiaries, and owners that are themselves flow-through entities that are not described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (
3
)) or the person on whose behalf the territory financial institution is acting.
(v)
Disregarded entity or limited branch.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(3)(v) through (vii) of this section, a withholding agent that makes a withholdable payment to an entity that is disregarded for U.S. federal tax purposes under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter as an entity separate from its single owner must treat the single owner as the payee. The rules under § 1.1471-3(d)(4) and (e)(3) apply to determine the circumstances under which a withholding agent may treat a payment made to a disregarded entity owned by an FFI as made to a payee that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and not as a payment made to a payee that is a nonparticipating FFI. A withholding agent that makes a payment to a limited branch (including an entity disregarded as a separate entity from its owner if such owner is an FFI and the disregarded entity is unable to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement with respect to accounts that it maintains) will be required to treat the payment as being made to a nonparticipating FFI.
(vi)
U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person.
A withholdable payment to a U.S. branch is a payment to a U.S. person if the U.S. branch is treated as a U.S. person (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(135)). In such case, the U.S. branch is treated as the payee. A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person, however, is not treated as a U.S. person for purposes of the withholding certificate it may provide to a withholding agent for purposes of chapter 4. Accordingly, a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person must furnish a
withholding certificate on a Form W-8 to certify its chapter 4 status (and not a Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification”). See also paragraph (f)(6) of this section for the rules under which a withholding agent can presume a payment to a U.S. branch constitutes income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person may not make an election to be withheld upon, as described in section 1471(b)(3) and § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii), for purposes of chapter 4. See § 1.1471-4(c)(2)(v) for the rule requiring a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person to apply the due diligence rules applicable to a U.S. withholding agent. See also § 1.1474-1(i)(1) and (2) for the requirement of a U.S. branch to report information regarding certain U.S. owners of owner documented FFIs and passive NFFEs. See § 1.1471-4(d) for rules for when a U.S. branch reports as a U.S. person.
(vii)
Foreign branch of a U.S. person.
A payment to a foreign branch of a U.S. person is generally a payment to a U.S. payee. However, a payment to a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution will be treated as a payment to an FFI if the foreign branch is a QI that is acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment. Therefore, a foreign branch that is a QI will provide the withholding agent with an intermediary withholding certificate and the withholding agent will report the payment as having been made to the foreign branch on a Form 1042-S.
(b)
Determination of payee's status.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a withholding agent must base its determination of the chapter 4 status of a payee on documentation that the withholding agent can reliably associate with such payment. If a withholding agent makes a payment to a person that is not the payee, the withholding agent will be required to determine the chapter 4 status of each intermediary or flow-through entity in the payment chain until the withholding agent is able to identify the payee. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for when a withholding agent can reliably associate a payment with appropriate documentation. Paragraph (d) of this section provides documentation requirements applicable to each class of payees, including exceptions for payments made with respect to offshore obligations or preexisting obligations. Paragraph (e) provides standards for determining when a withholding agent will be considered to have reason to know that a claim of exemption from withholding is unreliable or incorrect. Paragraph (f) of this section provides presumptions that apply for purposes of determining a payee's chapter 4 status in the absence of documentation or if the documentation provided is unreliable or incorrect.
(1)
Determining whether a payment is received by an intermediary.
A withholding agent must treat the person who receives a payment as an intermediary if it can reliably associate the payment with a valid intermediary withholding certificate on which the person who receives the payment claims to be a QI or NQI. A U.S. person's foreign branch that is acting in its capacity as a QI is treated as a foreign intermediary. A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation must also treat the person who receives the payment as an intermediary if the person has provided written notification, whether or not such notification is signed, that it accepts the payment on behalf of another person or persons. A withholding agent may rely on the type of certificate furnished as determinative of whether the person who receives the payment is an intermediary, unless the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that the certificate is incorrect. For example, a withholding agent that receives a beneficial owner withholding certificate from an FFI may treat the FFI as the beneficial owner unless it has information in its records that would indicate otherwise or the certificate contains information that is not consistent with beneficial owner status (for example, sub-account numbers that do not correspond to accounts maintained by the withholding agent for such person or names of one or more persons other than the person submitting the withholding certificate). If the FFI receives a payment in part as a beneficial owner and in part as an intermediary, the withholding agent may request that
the FFI furnish two certificates, that is, a beneficial owner certificate for the amounts it receives as a beneficial owner, and an intermediary withholding certificate for the amounts it receives as an intermediary. A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with documentation sufficient to treat the person who receives the payment as an intermediary or as other than an intermediary pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1) must follow the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f)(5) of this section to determine whether it must treat the person who receives the payment as an intermediary. A determination that a payment is made to an intermediary under this paragraph (b)(1) is not a determination that the payment can be reliably associated with documentation. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for rules on reliably associating a payment with documentation if such payment is made through an intermediary.
(2)
Determination of entity type.
A person's entity classification for purposes of chapter 4 is the person's entity classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, for example, an entity that is disregarded as a legal entity in its country of organization or an arrangement that does not have a legal personality and is not a juridical person in the country in which it was organized will be treated as an entity for purposes of chapter 4 if it is an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A withholding agent may rely upon a person's entity classification contained in a valid Form W-8 or W-9 if the withholding agent has no reason to know that the entity classification is incorrect. A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may also rely upon a written notification provided by the person who receives the payment, regardless of whether such notification is signed, that indicates the person's entity classification (other than as a QI, WP, or WT) unless the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that the entity classification indicated by the person who receives the payment is incorrect. A withholding agent may not rely on a person's claim of classification other than as a corporation if the person's name indicates that the person is a per se corporation described in § 301.7701-2(b)(8) of this chapter unless the certificate or written statement contains a statement that the person is a grandfathered per se corporation described in § 301.7701-2(b)(8) and that its grandfathered status has not been terminated.
(3)
Determination of whether the payment is made to a QI, WP, or WT.
A withholding agent may treat the person who receives a payment as a QI, WP, or WT if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid Form W-8IMY, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, that indicates that the person who receives the payment is a QI, WP, or WT, provides the person's QI-EIN, WP-EIN, or WT-EIN, and the person's GIIN, if applicable.
(4)
Determination of whether the payee is receiving effectively connected income.
A withholding agent may treat a payment as being made to a payee that is receiving income that is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, or gross proceeds from the sale of property that can produce income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, if it can reliably associate the payment with a valid Form W-8ECI described in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section or if it can do so under the presumption rule in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(c)
Rules for reliably associating a payment with a withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation
—(1)
In general.
A withholding agent can reliably associate a withholdable payment with valid documentation if, before the payment, it has obtained (either directly from the payee or through its agent) valid documentation appropriate to the payee's chapter 4 status as described in paragraph (d) of this section, it can reliably determine how much of the payment relates to the valid documentation, and it does not know or have reason to know that any of the information, certifications, or statements in, or associated with, the documentation are unreliable or incorrect. Thus, a withholding agent cannot reliably associate a withholdable payment with valid documentation provided by a payee to the extent such
documentation appears unreliable or incorrect with respect to the claims made, or to the extent that information required to allocate all or a portion of the payment to each payee is unreliable or incorrect. A withholding agent may rely on information and certifications contained in withholding certificates or other documentation without having to inquire into the truthfulness of the information or certifications, unless it knows or has reason to know that the information or certifications are untrue. A withholding agent may rely upon the same documentation for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4 provided the documentation is sufficient to meet the requirements of each chapter. Alternatively, a withholding agent may elect to rely upon the presumption rules of paragraph (f) of this section in lieu of obtaining documentation from the payee. A withholding certificate will be considered provided by a payee if a withholding agent obtains the certificate from a third party repository (rather than directly from the payee or through its agent) and the requirements in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv)(E) are satisfied. A withholding certificate obtained from a third party repository must still be reviewed by the withholding agent in the same manner as any other documentation to determine whether it may be relied upon for chapter 4 purposes. A withholding agent may rely on an electronic signature on a withholding certificate if the requirements in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(i)(B) are satisfied.
(2)
Reliably associating a payment with documentation if a payment is made through an intermediary or flow-through entity that is not the payee
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent that makes a payment to a foreign intermediary or foreign flow-through entity that is not the payee under paragraph (a) of this section can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation if, in addition to the documentation described in paragraph (d) of this section that is relevant to each payee, the withholding agent also has obtained a valid Form W-8IMY, described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, from the intermediary or flow-through entity (and, with respect to a payment made through a chain of intermediaries or flow-through entities, has received a valid Form W-8IMY from each intermediary or flow-through entity in that chain). An intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income may, in lieu of providing the withholding agent with documentation for each payee, provide pooled allocation information to the extent and in the manner permitted by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section. With respect to the documentation provided for the owners of a foreign flow-through entity, the foreign flow-through entity is permitted to provide the documentary evidence described in paragraph (d) of this section applicable to each payee in lieu of a withholding certificate, regardless of whether the payment is made with respect to an offshore obligation.
(ii)
Exception to entity account documentation rules for an offshore account of an intermediary or flow-through entity.
In the case of an offshore account held by an intermediary or flow-through entity not receiving a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, an FFI may, in lieu of obtaining a withholding certificate, reliably associate such account with valid documentation if the FFI has obtained a written statement certifying as to the account holder's chapter 4 status and stating that the account holder is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment. In such case, the intermediary or flow-through entity will also be required to provide the withholding statement that generally accompanies the Form W-8IMY, designating the payees and the appropriate amount that should be allocated to each payee, and valid documentation for each payee. If no such withholding statement or underlying documentation is provided, the payment will be treated as made to a nonparticipating FFI.
(3)
Requirements for validity of certificates
—(i)
Form W-9.
A valid Form W-9, or a substitute form, must meet the requirements prescribed in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter, including the requirement that the form contain the payee's name and TIN, and be signed and dated under penalties of perjury by the payee
or a person authorized to sign for the payee pursuant to sections 6061 through 6063 and the regulations thereunder. A foreign person, including a U.S. branch of a foreign person that is treated as a U.S. person under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv), or a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution that is a QI, may not provide a Form W-9.
(ii)
Beneficial owner withholding certificate (Form W-8BEN).
A beneficial owner withholding certificate includes a Form W-8BEN (or a substitute form) and such other form as the IRS may prescribe. A beneficial owner withholding certificate is valid only if its validity period has not expired, it is signed under penalties of perjury by a person with authority to sign for the person whose name is on the form, and it contains—
(A) The person's name, permanent residence address, and TIN (if required);
(B) A certification that the person is not a U.S. citizen (if the person is an individual) or a certification of the country under the laws of which the person is created, incorporated, or governed (for a person other than an individual);
(C) The person's entity classification for U.S. tax purposes;
(D) The person's chapter 4 status; and
(E) Such other information required under paragraph (d) of this section applicable to the chapter 4 status selected or otherwise required by the regulations under section 1471 or 1472, or by the form or its accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the information described in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii).
(iii)
Withholding certificate of an intermediary, qualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch (Form W-8IMY)
—(A)
In general.
A withholding certificate of an intermediary, qualified intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch of such entity (whether or not such branch is treated as a U.S. person) is valid for purposes of chapter 4 only if it is furnished on a Form W-8IMY, an acceptable substitute form, or such other form as the IRS may prescribe, it is signed under penalties of perjury by a person with authority to sign for the person named on the form, its validity period has not expired, and it contains the following information, statements, and certifications—
(
1
) The name and permanent residence address of the person.
(
2
) The country under the laws of which the person is created, incorporated, or governed.
(
3
) The person's entity classification for U.S. tax purposes.
(
4
) The person's chapter 4 status.
(
5
) A GIIN, in the case of a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI), and an EIN in the case of a QI, WP, or WT. Additionally, if a branch (other than a U.S. branch) of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI outside of its country of residence acts as an intermediary, a GIIN of such branch must be provided on the withholding certificate. In the case of a U.S. branch, see the rules in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(H) of this section.
(
6
) In the case of an intermediary certificate, a certification that, with respect to accounts listed on the withholding statement, the intermediary is not acting for its own account.
(
7
) With respect to a withholding certificate of a QI, a certification that it is acting as a QI with respect to the accounts listed on the withholding statement.
(
8
) In the case of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a U.S. branch of either such entities that is not treated as a U.S. person) that is an NQI, NWP, NWT, or a QI that makes an election to be withheld upon, an FFI withholding statement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section.
(
9
) In the case of a territory financial institution that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person or a U.S. branch that is not a U.S. branch of a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or nonparticipating FFI, a chapter 4 withholding statement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section.
(
10
) In the case of an NFFE or certified deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT and is not the
payee, a chapter 4 withholding statement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section.
(
11
) In the case of a nonparticipating FFI receiving a payment on behalf of one or more exempt beneficial owners, an exempt beneficial owner withholding statement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) and (
4
) of this section.
(
12
) Any other information, certifications, or statements as may be required by the form or its accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the information and certifications described in this paragraph.
(B)
Withholding statement
—(
1
)
In general.
A withholding statement forms an integral part of the withholding certificate and the penalties of perjury statement provided on the withholding certificate applies to the withholding statement as well. The withholding statement may be provided in any manner, and in any form, to which the person submitting the form and the withholding agent mutually agree, including electronically. A withholding statement may be provided electronically only if it meets the requirements of § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(B). The withholding statement must be updated as often as necessary for the withholding agent to meet its reporting and withholding obligations under chapter 4. A withholding agent will be liable for tax, interest, and penalties under § 1.1474-1(a) to the extent it does not follow the presumption rules of paragraph (f) of this section for any payment, or portion thereof, for which a withholding statement is required and the withholding agent does not have a valid withholding statement prior to making a payment. A withholding agent that is making a withholdable payment for which a withholding statement is also required for purposes of chapter 3 may only rely upon the withholding statement if, in addition to providing the information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the withholding statement also includes all of the information required for purposes of chapter 3 and specifies the chapter 4 status of each payee or pool of payees identified on the withholding statement for purposes of chapter 3.
(

)
Special requirements for an FFI withholding statement
—(
i
) An FFI withholding statement may include either payee-specific information or pooled information that indicates the portion of the payment allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, each class of recalcitrant account holders described in § 1.1471-1(b)(20)(i), or a class of nonparticipating FFIs. In addition, an FFI withholding statement may include an allocation of a portion of the payment to a pool of account holders (other than nonqualified intermediaries and flow-through entities) for whom no reporting is required on any of Forms 1042-S, 1099, and 8966, provided that the FFI provides to the withholding agent for each account holder payee-specific information (including the payee's chapter 4 status (using the applicable status code used for filing Form 1042-S)) and any other information required for purposes of chapter 3 or 61 on the withholding statement, and the FFI provides documentation for each account holder in the pool (an
exempt payee pool
). For example, a participating FFI may provide on its withholding statement an exempt payee pool for a payment of U.S. source interest on a bank deposit not subject to withholding or reporting under chapter 4 that is allocable to a pool of foreign account holders (that is, a withholdable payment that is not reported on any of Forms 1042-S, 1099, and 8966) and provide to the withholding agent documentation for each account holder included in the pool. If payee-specific information is provided for purposes of chapter 4 it must indicate both the portion of the payment allocated to each payee and each payee's chapter 4 status (using the applicable status code used for filing Form 1042-S). A participating FFI that applies the escrow procedures described in § 1.1471-4(b)(6) for dormant accounts must also indicate the portion of the payment allocated to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of recalcitrant account holders that hold dormant accounts for which the participating FFI (and not the withholding agent) will withhold in escrow. The withholding statement provided by a participating
FFI that applies the election to backup withhold under § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii) must also indicate the portion of the reportable payment that is a withholdable payment allocated to each recalcitrant account holder subject to backup withholding under section 3406. See section 3406 for when backup withholding is required, including the exception to backup withholding under § 31.3406(g)-1(e). Regardless of whether the FFI withholding statement provides information on a pooled or payee-specific basis, a withholding statement provided by an FFI other than an FFI acting as a WP, WT, or QI with respect to the account must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that receives the payment and such entity's chapter 4 status (using the applicable status code used for filing Form 1042-S) and GIIN (when required under paragraph (d) of this section), when applicable. An FFI withholding statement must also include any other information that the withholding agent or payor reasonably requests in order to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4, and chapters 3 and 61, if applicable.
(
ii
) An FFI withholding statement provided by a reporting Model 2 FFI or a reporting Model 1 FFI may indicate, with respect to a withholdable payment, that the payment is allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, which is comprised of account holders receiving a payment that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or 4 or to backup withholding under section 3406 and that are, with respect to a reporting Model 2 FFI, the holders of non-consenting U.S. accounts as described in an applicable IGA when the FFI reports the accounts in one of the pools described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the year in which the payment is made; or with respect to a reporting Model 1 FFI, the holders of accounts that have U.S. indicia for which appropriate documentation sufficient to treat the accounts as held by other than specified U.S. persons has not been provided pursuant to an applicable Model 1 IGA and the reporting Model 1 FFI reports the accounts as U.S. reportable accounts pursuant to the applicable Model 1 IGA for the year in which the payment is made.
(
iii
) An FFI withholding statement provided by a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a non-U.S. payor (a payor other than a U.S. payor as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5)) may indicate, with respect to a withholdable payment, that the payment is allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (in addition to the U.S. payees described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section), which is comprised of account holders that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or 4 or to backup withholding under section 3406 and that are, with respect to a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), account holders that hold U.S. accounts (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(134) and an applicable Model 2 IGA) that the FFI reports as U.S. accounts pursuant to § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (5) for the year in which the payment is made; with respect to a registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a reporting Model 1 FFI), account holders of U.S. accounts that the FFI reports pursuant to the conditions of its applicable deemed-compliant status under § 1.1471-5(f)(1) for the year in which the payment is made; or with respect to a reporting Model 1 FFI, account holders of U.S. accounts that the reporting Model 1 FFI reports as reportable U.S. accounts pursuant to an applicable Model 1 IGA, and which includes the U.S. TINs of such account holders, for the year in which the payment is made.
(
iv
) An FFI withholding statement provided by a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI may include a certification that the FFI is reporting, for the year in which the payment is made, an account held by a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners (or, with respect to a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI, one or more controlling persons that are specified U.S. persons, as defined in an applicable IGA) as a U.S. account (excluding a non-consenting U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder) or, with respect to a reporting Model 1 FFI, a U.S. reportable account, in accordance with the terms of the FFI agreement or an applicable IGA.
(
v
) An FFI withholding statement provided by a participating FFI or a reporting Model 1 FFI may include a certification that the FFI is reporting to the IRS for the year of the payment all of the information described in § 1.1471-4(d) or § 1.1474-1(i)(1) (as applicable) with respect to all specified U.S. persons described in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) with respect to an account holder or payee that the FFI has agreed to treat as an owner-documented FFI.
(
3
)
Special requirements for a chapter 4 withholding statement.
A chapter 4 withholding statement must contain the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type, and chapter 4 status (using the applicable status code used for filing Form 1042-S) of each payee, the amount allocated to each payee, a valid withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation sufficient to establish the chapter 4 status of each payee, and each intermediary or flow-through entity that receives the payment on behalf of the payee, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and any other information the withholding agent reasonably requests in order to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, a chapter 4 withholding statement is permitted to provide pooled allocation information with respect to payees that are treated as nonparticipating FFIs (in lieu of providing the withholding agent with documentation for each payee). A chapter 4 withholding statement may include an allocation of a portion of the payment to a pool of payees (rather than to each payee) for whom no reporting is required on any of Forms 1042-S, 1099, and 8966, provided each payee is identified on the withholding statement and documentation is provided to the withholding agent for each payee included in the pool. If the withholdable payment is a reportable amount under chapter 3, see the provisions of § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C) for any additional information that may be required on the withholding statement (including pooled information under the alternative procedures described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(D), if applicable).
(
4
)
Special requirements for an exempt beneficial owner withholding statement.
An exempt beneficial owner withholding statement must include the name, address, TIN (if any), entity type, and chapter 4 status (using the applicable status code used for filing Form 1042-S) of each exempt beneficial owner on behalf of which the nonparticipating FFI is receiving the payment, the amount of the payment allocable to each exempt beneficial owner, a valid withholding certificate or other documentation sufficient to establish the chapter 4 status of each exempt beneficial owner in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and any other information the withholding agent reasonably requests in order to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. The withholding statement must allocate the remainder of the payment that is not allocated to an exempt beneficial owner to the nonparticipating FFI receiving the payment. With respect to the amount of the payment allocable to each exempt beneficial owner and subject to withholding under chapter 3, see § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).
(
5
)
Nonqualified intermediary withholding statement.
A withholding agent that is making a withholdable payment to a nonqualified intermediary for which a withholding statement is required under chapters 3 or 4 may accept a withholding statement that meets the requirements described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(
3
)(
i
) or (
ii
).
(C)
Failure to provide allocation information.
A withholding certificate that fails to provide allocation information or any of the required documentation for one or more of the payees will not be treated as invalid with respect to the persons for whom valid documentation and allocation information is properly provided. The portion of the payment that is not reliably associated with underlying documentation or that is not properly allocated will be treated in accordance with the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. For example, assume a withholding certificate that is provided by a participating FFI that is an NQI includes an FFI withholding statement that indicates that 50 percent of the payment is allocable to payees that are exempt for purposes of chapter 4 but does not allocate the remaining 50 percent of the payment for purposes of
chapter 4. In such case, the withholding agent may treat 50 percent of the payment as exempt from chapter 4 and the remaining 50 percent that was not allocated will be treated, under the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, as made to a pool of payees that are nonparticipating FFIs.
(D)
Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a QI that assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3.
A QI that assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 for a payment may not make an election to be withheld upon, as described in § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii), with respect to that payment. Thus, if a QI assumes primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, in addition to the other requirements described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid withholding certificate only when the QI has also indicated on the intermediary withholding certificate that it will assume primary withholding responsibility for that payment for purposes of chapter 4.
(E)
Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a QI that does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3.
A QI that does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income will be required to make the election to be withheld upon with respect to that payment. Thus, if a QI does not assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3, a withholding agent can reliably associate a payment of U.S. source FDAP income with a valid withholding certificate only when, in addition to the other information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the withholding certificate indicates that the QI does not assume primary withholding responsibility for that payment for purposes of chapter 4.
(F)
Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a territory financial institution that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person.
A withholding agent may reliably associate a payment with an intermediary withholding certificate or flow-through withholding certificate of a territory financial institution that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person if, in addition to the other information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the certificate contains an EIN of the territory financial institution and a certification that the territory financial institution agrees to be treated as a U.S. person and accepts primary withholding responsibility with respect to the payment for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4.
(G)
Special rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a territory financial institution that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person.
A withholding agent may reliably associate a payment with an intermediary withholding certificate or a flow-through withholding certificate of a territory financial institution that does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person if, in addition to the information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the certificate indicates that the institution has not agreed to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of chapter 4 and the institution provides a withholding statement described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section.
(H)
Rules applicable to a withholding certificate of a U.S. branch.
A withholding agent may reliably associate a payment with a withholding certificate of a U.S. branch of an FFI that is treated as a U.S. person for purposes of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) if, in addition to the other information required by paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the certificate contains the EIN of the U.S. branch and a certification that the U.S. branch is described in paragraph § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) and, accordingly, is required to accept primary withholding responsibility with respect to the payment for purposes of both chapters 3 and 4. A withholding agent may reliably associate a payment with a withholding certificate of a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person and that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) if, in addition to the other information required by paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the certificate contains the EIN of the U.S. branch and a certification that the U.S. branch applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C).
However, the requirement to obtain the certification that a U.S. branch applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) shall not apply to payments made on or before June 30, 2017.
(iv)
Certificate for exempt status (Form W-8EXP).
A Form W-8EXP is valid only if it contains the name, address, and chapter 4 status of the payee, the relevant certifications or documentation, and any other requirements indicated in the instructions to the form, and is signed under penalties of perjury by a person with authority to sign for the payee.
(v)
Certificate for effectively connected income (Form W-8ECI).
A Form W-8ECI is valid only if, in addition to meeting the requirements in the instructions to the form, it contains the name, address, and TIN of the payee (other than a GIIN), represents that the amounts for which the certificate is furnished are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and are includable in the payee's gross income for the taxable year (or are gross proceeds from the sale of property that can produce income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States), and is signed under penalties of perjury by a person with authority to sign for the payee.
(4)
Requirements for written statements.
A written statement is a statement by the payee, or other person receiving the payment, that provides the person's chapter 4 status and any other information reasonably requested by the withholding agent to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4 with respect to the payment, such as whether the person is receiving the payment as a beneficial owner, intermediary, or flow-through entity. A written statement is valid only if it is provided by a person with respect to an offshore obligation, contains the name of the person, the person's address, the certifications relevant to the person's chapter 4 status (as contained on a withholding certificate), any additional information required with respect to the chapter 4 status claimed as provided under paragraph (d) of this section (for example, a GIIN), and a signed and dated certification that the information provided on the form is accurate and will be updated by the individual within 30 days of a change in circumstances that causes the form to become incorrect. A written statement may be submitted in any form that is acceptable to the withholding agent, including a statement made as part of the account opening documentation. A written statement may be used in lieu of a withholding certificate only to the extent provided under § 1.1471-3(d), as applicable to the chapter 4 status claimed.
(5)
Requirements for documentary evidence.
Documentary evidence with respect to a payee is only reliable if it contains sufficient information to support the payee's claim of chapter 4 status.
(i)
Foreign status.
Acceptable documentary evidence supporting a claim of foreign status includes the following types of documentation if the documentation contains a permanent residence address for the person named on the documentation (or indicates the country in which a person that is an individual is a resident or citizen or the country in which a person that is an entity has a permanent residence or is incorporated or organized, if the withholding agent has otherwise obtained a current permanent residence address for the person)—
(A)
Certificate of residence.
A certificate of residence issued by an appropriate tax official of the country in which the payee claims to be a resident that indicates that the payee has filed its most recent income tax return as a resident of that country;
(B)
Individual government identification.
With respect to an individual, any valid identification issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality), that is typically used for identification purposes;
(C)
QI documentation.
With respect to an account maintained in a jurisdiction with anti-money laundering rules that have been approved by the IRS in connection with a QI agreement (as referenced in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii)), any of the documents other than a Form W-8 or W-9 referenced in the jurisdiction's attachment to the QI agreement for identifying individuals or entities;
(D)
Entity government documentation.
With respect to an entity, any documentation that substantiates that the entity is actually organized or created under the laws of a foreign country; and
(E)
Third-party credit report.
For a payment made with respect to an offshore obligation to an individual, a third-party credit report that is obtained pursuant to the conditions described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4)(ii).
(ii)
Chapter 4 status.
Acceptable documentary evidence supporting an entity's claim of chapter 4 status includes—
(A)
General documentary evidence.
With respect to an entity other than a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, any organizational document (such as articles of incorporation or a trust agreement), financial statement, third-party credit report, letter from a government agency, or statement from a government Web site, agency, or registrar (such as an SEC report) to the extent permitted in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section;
(B)
Preexisting obligation documentary evidence.
With respect to a preexisting obligation of an entity, any classification in the withholding agent's records with respect to the payee that was determined based on documentation supplied by the payee (or other person receiving the payment) or a standardized industry coding system and that was recorded by the withholding agent consistent with its normal business practices for AML or another regulatory purpose (other than for tax purposes), to the extent permitted by paragraph (d) of this section and provided there is no U.S. indicia associated with the payee for which appropriate curing documentation has not been obtained as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section; and
(C)
Payee-specific documentary evidence.
A letter from an auditor or attorney with a location in the United States that is not related to the withholding agent or payee and is subject to the authority of a regulatory body that governs the auditor's or attorney's review of the chapter 4 status of the payee, any bankruptcy filing, corporate resolution, copy of a stock market index or other document to the extent permitted in the specific payee documentation requirements in paragraph (d) and (e) of this section.
(6)
Applicable rules for withholding certificates, written statements, and documentary evidence.
The provisions in this paragraph (c)(6) describe standards generally applicable to withholding certificates on Forms W-8 (or substitute forms), written statements, and documentary evidence furnished to establish the payee's chapter 4 status. These provisions do not apply to Forms W-9 (or their substitutes). For corresponding provisions regarding the Form W-9 (or a substitute Form W-9), see section 3406 and the regulations thereunder.
(i)
Who may sign the withholding certificate or written statement.
A withholding certificate (including an acceptable substitute) or written statement may be signed by any person authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the person whose name is on the certificate or written statement, as provided in sections 6061 through 6063 and the regulations thereunder. A person authorized to sign a withholding certificate or written statement includes an officer or director of a corporation, a partner of a partnership, a trustee of a trust, an executor of an estate, any foreign equivalent of the former titles, and any other person that has been provided written authorization by the individual or entity named on the certificate or written statement to sign documentation on such person's behalf.
(ii)
Period of validity
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided otherwise in paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, a withholding certificate or written statement will remain valid until the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the withholding certificate or written statement is signed. Documentary evidence is generally valid until the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the documentary evidence is provided to the withholding agent. Nevertheless, documentary evidence that contains an expiration date may be treated as valid until that expiration date if doing so would provide a longer period of validity than the
three-year period. Notwithstanding the validity periods permitted by paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, a withholding certificate, written statement, and documentary evidence will cease to be valid if the withholding agent has knowledge of a change in circumstances that makes the information on the documentation incorrect. Therefore, a withholding agent is required to institute procedures to ensure that any change to the customer master files that constitutes a change in circumstances described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(E) of this section is identified by the withholding agent. In addition, a withholding agent is required to notify any person providing documentation of the person's obligation to notify the withholding agent of a change in circumstances.
(B)
Indefinite validity.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the following certificates (or parts of certificates), written statements, or documentary evidence shall remain valid until the withholding agent has knowledge of a change in circumstances that makes the information on the documentation incorrect—
(
1
) A withholding certificate or written statement provided by a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that has furnished a valid GIIN that has been verified by the withholding agent in the manner set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
(
2
) A beneficial owner withholding certificate and documentary evidence supporting the individual's claim of foreign status when both are provided together (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(B)(
1
)) by an individual claiming foreign status, if the withholding agent does not have a current U.S. residence or U.S. mailing address for the payee and does not have one or more current U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers the withholding agent has for the payee;
(
3
) A beneficial owner withholding certificate that is provided by an entity described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section (other than an entity described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section) and documentary evidence establishing the entity's foreign status when both are received by the withholding agent before the validity period of either would otherwise expire under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section;
(
4
) A withholding certificate of an intermediary, flow-through entity, or U.S. branch (not including the withholding certificates, written statements, or documentary evidence of the payees, or withholding statements associated with the withholding certificate);
(
5
) A withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence furnished by a foreign government, government of a U.S. territory, foreign central bank (including the Bank for International Settlements), international organization, or entity that is wholly owned by any such entities;
(
6
) Documentary evidence that is not generally renewed or amended (such as a certificate of incorporation); and
(
7
) For the validity period of a beneficial owner withholding certificate provided by an entity described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section, see § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii).
(C)
Indefinite validity in the case of certain offshore obligations.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the following certificates, written statements, and documentary evidence that are provided with respect to offshore obligations shall remain valid until a change in circumstances occurs that makes the information on the documentation incorrect—
(
1
) A withholding certificate or documentary evidence provided by an individual claiming foreign status if the withholding agent does not have a current U.S. residence or U.S. mailing address for the payee, does not have one or more current U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers the withholding agent has for the payee, and has not been provided standing instructions to make a payment in the United States for the obligation;
(
2
) A withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence provided by one of the following entities if such entity is the payee—
(
i
) A retirement fund described in § 1.1471-6(f) or an entity that is wholly owned by such a retirement fund;
(
ii
) An excepted nonfinancial group entity described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(i);
(
iii
) A section 501(c) entity described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(v);
(
iv

(
viii
) An NFFE affiliate described in § 1.1472-1(c)(1)(ii);
(
ix
) An active NFFE that the withholding agent has determined, through its AML due diligence, is engaged in a business other than that of a financial institution, and ongoing monitoring of the account for purposes of AML due diligence does not indicate that the determination is incorrect; and
(
x
) A sponsored FFI described in § 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(F);
(
3
) A withholding certificate or written statement of an owner-documented FFI, but not including the withholding statements, documentary evidence, and withholding certificates of its owners (unless such documentation is permitted indefinite validity under another provision);
(
4
) An owner reporting statement associated with a withholding certificate of an owner-documented FFI, provided the account balance of all accounts held by such owner-documented FFI with the withholding agent does not exceed $1,000,000 on the later of June 30, 2014, or the last day of the calendar year in which the account was opened, and the last day of each subsequent calendar year preceding the payment, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii), and the owner-documented FFI does not have any contingent beneficiaries or designated classes with unidentified beneficiaries; and
(
5
) A withholding certificate of a passive NFFE or excepted territory NFFE, provided the account balance of all accounts held by such entity with the withholding agent does not exceed $1,000,000 on the later of June 30, 2014, or the last day of the calendar year in which the account was opened, and the last day of each subsequent calendar year preceding the payment, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii), and the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the entity has any contingent beneficiaries or designated classes with unidentified beneficiaries.
(D)
Exception for certificate for effectively connected income.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(B) to (C) of this section, the period of validity of a withholding certificate furnished to a withholding agent to claim a reduced rate of withholding for income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States shall be limited to the three-year period described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section.
(E)
Change in circumstances
—(
1
)
Defined.
For purposes of this chapter, a person is considered to have a change in circumstances only if such change would affect the chapter 4 status of the person. A change in circumstances includes any change that results in the addition of information described in paragraph (e)(4) relevant to a person's claim of foreign status (that is, U.S. indicia that is not otherwise cured by documentation on file and that is relevant to the chapter 4 status claimed) or otherwise conflicts with such person's claim of chapter 4 status. Unless stated otherwise, a change of address or telephone number is a change in circumstances for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(E) only if it changes to an address or telephone number in the United States. A change in circumstances affecting the withholding information provided to the withholding agent, including allocation information or withholding pools contained in a withholding statement or owner reporting statement, will terminate the validity of the withholding certificate with respect to the information that is no longer reliable, until the information is updated.
(
2
)
Obligation to notify withholding agent of a change in circumstances.
If a change in circumstances makes any information on a certificate or other documentation incorrect, then the person whose name is on the certificate or other documentation must inform the withholding agent within 30 days of the change and furnish a new certificate, a new written statement, or new documentary evidence. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if an FFI's chapter 4 status changes solely because the
jurisdiction in which the FFI is resident, organized, or located is later treated as having an IGA in effect (including a jurisdiction that had a Model 2 IGA in effect and is later treated as having a Model 1 IGA in effect) or ceases to be treated as having an IGA in effect, in lieu of providing a new withholding certificate, the FFI may, within 30 days of such change in circumstances, provide to the withholding agent oral or written confirmation (including by email) of the change in the FFI's chapter 4 status. If an intermediary or a flow-through entity becomes aware that a certificate or other appropriate documentation it has furnished to the person from whom it collects a payment is no longer valid because of a change in the circumstances of the person who issued the certificate or furnished the other appropriate documentation, then the intermediary or flow-through entity must notify the person from whom it collects the payment of the change in circumstances within 30 days of the date that it knows or has reason to know of the change in circumstances. It must also obtain a new withholding certificate or new appropriate documentation to replace the existing certificate or documentation the validity of which has expired due to the change in circumstances.
(
3
)
Withholding agent's obligation with respect to a change in circumstances.
A certificate or other documentation becomes invalid on the date that the withholding agent holding the certificate or documentation knows or has reason to know that circumstances affecting the correctness of the certificate or documentation have changed. A withholding agent will not have reason to know of a change in circumstances with respect to an FFI's chapter 4 status that results solely because a jurisdiction is later treated as having an IGA in effect (including a jurisdiction that had a Model 2 IGA in effect and is later treated as having a Model 1 IGA in effect) until the withholding agent obtains the confirmation of a change in the FFI's chapter 4 status described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(E)(
2
) of this section (which will become part of the FFI's withholding certificate or other documentation retained by the withholding agent). A withholding agent will have reason to know of a change in circumstances with respect to an FFI's chapter 4 status that results solely because the jurisdiction in which the FFI is resident, organized, or located ceases to be treated as having an IGA in effect on the date that the jurisdiction ceases to be treated as having an IGA in effect. A withholding agent may choose to treat a person as having the same chapter 4 status that it had prior to the change in circumstances until the earlier of 90 days from the date that the certificate or documentation became invalid due to the change in circumstances or the date that a new certificate or new documentation is obtained. See, however, § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for requirements, including the requirement to withhold under chapter 3 or section 3406, applicable when a change in circumstances occurs for purposes of chapter 3 and the related grace period allowed under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv). A withholding agent may rely on a certificate without having to inquire into possible changes of circumstances that may affect the validity of the statement, unless it knows or has reason to know that circumstances have changed. A withholding agent may require a new certificate or additional documentation at any time prior to a payment, regardless of whether the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that any information stated on the certificate or documentation has changed.
(
4
) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1471-3T(c)(6)(ii)(E)(
4
).
(iii)
Record Retention
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent must retain each withholding certificate, written statement, or copy of documentary evidence for as long as it may be relevant to the determination of the withholding agent's tax liability under section 1474(a) and § 1.1474-1. A withholding agent may retain an original, certified copy, or photocopy (including a microfiche, electronic scan, or similar means of electronic storage) of the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence. With respect to documentary evidence, the withholding agent must also note in its records the date on which the document was received and reviewed. Any
documentation that is stored electronically must be made available in hard copy form to the IRS upon request during an examination.
(B)
Exception for documentary evidence received with respect to offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that is making a payment with respect to an offshore obligation and is not required to retain copies of documentation reviewed pursuant to its AML due diligence, may, in lieu of retaining the documents as set forth in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A), retain a notation of the type of documentation reviewed, the date the documentation was reviewed, the document's identification number (if any) (for example, a passport number), and whether such documentation contained any U.S. indicia. The previous sentence applies with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation, except, in such case, the requirement to record whether the documentation contained U.S. indicia does not apply. See also § 1.1471-4(c)(2)(iv) for the record retention requirements of a participating FFI.
(iv)
Electronic transmission of withholding certificate, written statement, and documentary evidence.
A withholding agent may accept a withholding certificate (including an acceptable substitute form), a written statement, or other such form as the IRS may prescribe, electronically in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv).
(v)
Acceptable substitute withholding certificate
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may substitute its own form for an official Form W-8 (or such other official form as the IRS may prescribe). A substitute form will be acceptable if it contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official form, it contains the same certifications relevant to the transactions as are contained on the official form and these certifications are clearly set forth, and the substitute form includes a signature-under-penalties-of-perjury statement identical to the one on the official form. The substitute form is acceptable even if it does not contain all of the provisions contained on the official form, so long as it contains those provisions that are relevant to the transaction for which it is furnished. A withholding agent may choose to provide a substitute form that does not include all of the chapter 4 statuses provided on the official version but the substitute form must include any chapter 4 status for which withholding may apply, such as the categories for a nonparticipating FFI or passive NFFE. A withholding agent that uses a substitute form must furnish instructions relevant to the substitute form only to the extent and in the manner specified in the instructions to the official form. A withholding agent may use a substitute form that is written in a language other than English and may accept a form that is filled out in a language other than English, but the withholding agent must make available an English translation of the form and its contents to the IRS upon request. A withholding agent may refuse to accept a certificate (including the official Form W-8) from a person if the certificate provided is not an acceptable substitute form provided by the withholding agent, but only if the withholding agent furnishes the person with an acceptable substitute form within five business days of receipt of an unacceptable form from the person. In that case, the substitute form is acceptable only if it contains a notice that the withholding agent has refused to accept the form submitted by the person and that the person must submit the acceptable form provided by the withholding agent in order for the person to be treated as having furnished the required withholding certificate.
(B)
Non-IRS form for individuals.
A withholding agent may also substitute its own form for an official Form W-8BEN (for individuals), regardless of whether the substitute form is titled a Form W-8. However, in addition to the name and address of the individual that is the payee or beneficial owner, the substitute form must provide all countries in which the individual is resident for tax purposes, country of birth, a tax identification number (if any) for each country of residence, the individual's date of birth, and must contain a signed and dated certification made under penalties of perjury that the information provided on the
form is accurate and will be updated by the individual within 30 days of a change in circumstances that causes the form to become incorrect. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the signed certification provided on a form need not be signed under penalties of perjury if the form is accompanied by documentary evidence that supports the individual's claim of foreign status. Such documentary evidence may be the same documentary evidence that is used to support foreign status in the case of a payee whose account has U.S. indicia as described in paragraph (e) of this section or § 1.1471-4(c)(4)(i)(A). The form may also request other information required for purposes of tax or AML due diligence in the United States or in other countries.
(vi)
Electronic confirmation of TIN on withholding certificate.
The Commissioner may prescribe procedures in a revenue procedure or other appropriate guidance to require a withholding agent to confirm electronically with the IRS information concerning any TIN stated on a withholding certificate.
(vii)
Reliance on a prior version of a withholding certificate.
Upon the issuance by the IRS of an updated version of a withholding certificate, a withholding agent may continue to accept the prior version of the withholding certificate in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii)(C) and without regard to whether a withholdable payment associated with the certificate is subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a).
(7)
Curing documentation errors.
The provisions in this paragraph (c)(7) describe standards generally applicable to withholding certificates (Forms W-8 or substitute forms), written statements, and documentary evidence furnished to establish the payee's chapter 4 status. These provisions do not apply to Forms W-9 (or their substitutes). For corresponding provisions regarding the Form W-9 (or a substitute Form W-9), see section 3406 and the regulations thereunder.
(i)
Curing inconsequential errors on a withholding certificate.
A withholding agent may treat a withholding certificate as valid, notwithstanding that the withholding certificate contains an inconsequential error, if the withholding agent has sufficient documentation on file to supplement the information missing from the withholding certificate due to the error. In such case, the documentation relied upon to cure the inconsequential error must be conclusive. For example, a withholding certificate in which the individual submitting the form abbreviated the country of residence in an ambiguous way may be treated as valid, notwithstanding the abbreviation, if the withholding agent has government issued identification for the person from a country that reasonably matches the abbreviation. On the other hand, an ambiguous abbreviation for the country of residence that does not reasonably match the country of residence shown on the person's passport is not an inconsequential error. A failure to select an entity type on a withholding certificate is not an inconsequential error, even if the withholding agent has an organization document for the entity that provides sufficient information to determine the person's entity type, if the person was eligible to make an election under § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) of this chapter (that is, a check-the-box election). A failure to check a box to make a required certification on the withholding certificate or to provide a country of residence or a country under which treaty benefits are sought is not an inconsequential error. In addition, information on a withholding certificate that contradicts other information contained on the withholding certificate or in the customer master file is not an inconsequential error.
(ii)
Documentation received after the time of payment.
Proof that withholding was not required under the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder also may be established after the date of payment by the withholding agent on the basis of a valid withholding certificate and/or other appropriate documentation that was furnished after the date of payment but that was effective as of the date of payment. A withholding certificate furnished after the date of payment will be considered effective as of the date of the payment if the certificate contains a signed affidavit (either at the bottom of the form or on an attached page)
that states that the information and representations contained on the certificate were accurate as of the time of the payment. A certificate obtained within 30 days after the date of the payment will not be considered to be unreliable solely because it does not contain an affidavit. However, in the case of a withholding certificate of an individual received more than a year after the date of payment, the withholding agent will be required to obtain, in addition to the withholding certificate and affidavit, documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section that supports the individual's claim of foreign status. In the case of a withholding certificate of an entity received more than a year after the date of payment, the withholding agent will be required to obtain, in addition to the withholding certificate and affidavit, documentary evidence specified in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section that supports the chapter 4 status claimed. If documentation other than a withholding certificate is submitted from a payee more than a year after the date of payment, the withholding agent will be required to also obtain from the payee a withholding certificate and affidavit supporting the chapter 4 status claimed as of the date of the payment. See, however, § 1.1441-1(b)(7)(ii) for special rules that apply when a withholding certificate is received after the date of the payment to claim that income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (as applied for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(ii) to a claim to establish that the payment is not a withholdable payment under § 1.1473-1(a)(4)(ii) rather than to claim an exemption described in § 1.1441-4(a)(1)).
(8)
Documentation furnished on account-by-account basis unless exception provided for sharing documentation within expanded affiliated group.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(8), a withholding agent that is a financial institution with which a customer may open an account must obtain withholding certificates, written statements, Forms W-9, or documentary evidence on an account-by-account basis. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a withholding agent may rely upon the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence furnished by a customer under any one or more of the circumstances described in this paragraph (c)(8).
(i)
Single branch systems.
A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a customer for another account if both accounts are held at the same branch location and both accounts are treated as consolidated obligations.
(ii)
Universal account systems.
A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a customer for an account held at another branch location of the same withholding agent or at a branch location of a member of the expanded affiliated group of the withholding agent if the withholding agent treats all accounts that share documentation as consolidated obligations and the withholding agent and the other branch location or expanded affiliated group member are part of a universal account system that uses a customer identifier that can be used to retrieve systematically all other accounts of the customer. A withholding agent that opts to rely upon the chapter 4 status designated for the payee in the universal account system without obtaining and reviewing copies of the documentation supporting the status must be able to produce all documentation (or a notation of the documentary evidence reviewed if the withholding agent is not required to retain copies of the documentary evidence) relevant to the chapter 4 status claimed upon request by the IRS and will be liable for any underwithholding that results from any failure to assign the correct status based upon the available information.
(iii)
Shared account systems.
A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a customer for an account held at another branch location of the same withholding agent or at a branch location of a member of the expanded affiliated group of the withholding agent if the withholding agent treats all accounts that share documentation as a consolidated obligation and the withholding agent and the
other branch location or expanded affiliated group member share an information system, electronic or otherwise, that is described in this paragraph (c)(8)(iii). The system must allow the withholding agent to easily access data regarding the nature of the documentation, the information contained in the documentation (including a copy of the documentation itself), and the validity status of the documentation. The information system must also allow the withholding agent to easily transmit data into the system regarding any facts of which it becomes aware that may affect the reliability of the documentation. The withholding agent must be able to establish, to the extent applicable, how and when it has transmitted data regarding any facts of which it became aware that may affect the reliability of the documentation and must be able to establish that any data it has transmitted to the information system has been processed and appropriate due diligence has been exercised regarding the validity of the documentation. A withholding agent that opts to rely upon the chapter 4 status designated for the payee in the shared account system without obtaining and reviewing copies of the documentation supporting the status must be able to produce all documentation (or a notation of the documentary evidence reviewed if the withholding agent is not required to retain copies of the documentary evidence) relevant to the chapter 4 status claimed upon request by the IRS and will be liable for any underwithholding that results from any failure to assign the correct status based upon the available information.
(iv)
Document sharing for gross proceeds.
[Reserved]
(v)
Preexisting account.
A withholding agent may rely on documentation furnished by a payee for a preexisting account held at another branch location of the same withholding agent or at a branch location of a member of the expanded affiliated group of the withholding agent if the withholding agent obtains and reviews copies of such documentation supporting the chapter 4 status designated for the payee and the withholding agent has no reason to know that, at the time the documentation is obtained by the withholding agent, the documentation is unreliable or incorrect. For example, the withholding agent may not rely on documentation furnished by a payee for a preexisting account held at another branch location of the same withholding agent or at a branch location of a member of the expanded affiliated group of the withholding agent if, based on information in the withholding agent's account records, the withholding agent has reason to know that such documentation is unreliable or incorrect.
(9)
Reliance on documentation collected by or certifications provided by other persons
—(i)
Shared documentation system maintained by an agent.
A withholding agent may rely on documentation collected by an agent (including a fund advisor for mutual funds, hedge funds, or a private equity group) of the withholding agent. The agent may retain the documentation as part of an information system maintained for a single withholding agent or multiple withholding agents provided that under the system, any withholding agent on behalf of which the agent retains documentation may easily access data regarding the nature of the documentation, the information contained in the documentation (including a copy of the documentation itself) and its validity, and must allow such withholding agent to easily transmit data, either directly into an electronic system or by providing such information to the agent, regarding any facts of which it becomes aware that may affect the reliability of the documentation. The withholding agent must be able to establish, to the extent applicable, how and when it has transmitted data regarding any facts of which it became aware that may affect the reliability of the documentation and must be able to establish that any data it has transmitted has been processed and appropriate due diligence has been exercised regarding the validity of the documentation. The agent must have a system in effect to ensure that any information it receives regarding facts that affect the reliability of the documentation or the chapter 4 status assigned to
the customer are provided to all withholding agents for which the agent retains the documentation and any chapter 4 status assigned by the agent is amended to incorporate such information. A withholding agent that opts to rely upon the chapter 4 status assigned by the agent without obtaining and reviewing copies of the documentation supporting the status must be able to produce all documentation relevant to the chapter 4 status claimed upon request by the IRS and will be liable for any underwithholding that results from a failure of the agent to assign the correct status based upon the available information. See § 1.1474-1(a) for a withholding agent's liability when it relies upon an agent for chapter 4 purposes. This paragraph (c)(9)(i) does not apply to a withholding certificate provided by a QI, a withholding certificate provided by a territory financial institution that elects to be treated as a U.S. person, or any withholding statement, unless the person submitting the form specifically identifies the withholding agents for which the certificates and/or statements are provided.
(ii)
Third-party data providers.
A withholding agent may rely upon documentation collected by a third-party data provider with respect to an entity, subject to the conditions described in this paragraph (c)(9)(ii).
(A) The third-party data provider must have collected documentation that is sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of the entity under paragraph (d) of this section.
(B) The third-party data provider must be in the business of providing credit reports or business reports to customers unrelated to it and must have reviewed all information it has for the entity and verified that such additional information does not conflict with the chapter 4 status claimed by the entity. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(B), a customer is related to a third-party data provider if they have a relationship with each other that is described in section 267(b).
(C) The third-party data provider must notify the entity submitting the documentation that such entity must notify the third-party data provider in the event of a change in circumstances within 30 days of the change in circumstances, and the third-party data provider must be obligated under its contract with the withholding agent to notify the withholding agent if a change in circumstances occurs.
(D) The withholding agent may not rely upon a chapter 4 status provided by a third-party data provider if the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that the chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect based on information in the withholding agent's account records, or if the documentation or information provided by the third-party data provider does not support the chapter 4 status claimed.
(E) The withholding agent must be able to submit copies of the documentation received from the third-party data provider upon request to the IRS and will remain liable for any underwithholding that occurs as a result of its reliance on information provided by the third-party data provider if the documentation is invalid or unreliable.
(F) This paragraph (c)(9)(ii) does not apply to a withholding statement or a withholding certificate that contains an election to accept withholding or reporting responsibility (such as one made by a QI, territory financial institution, or U.S. branch) provided by a third-party data provider.
(iii)
Reliance on certification provided by introducing brokers
—(A) A withholding agent may rely on a certification of a broker indicating the broker's determination of a payee's chapter 4 status and indicating that the broker holds valid documentation sufficient to determine the payee's chapter 4 status under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to any readily tradable instrument as defined in § 31.3406(h)-1(d) of this chapter if the conditions in paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section are satisfied and the broker is either—
(
1
) A U.S. person (including a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person) that is acting as the agent of the payee; or
(
2
) A participating FFI or a reporting Model 1 FFI that is acting as the agent of the payee with respect to an obligation and receiving all payments from
the withholding agent with respect to such obligation as an intermediary on behalf of the payee.
(B) The certification from the broker must be in writing or in electronic form and contain all of the information required of a chapter 4 withholding statement described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
). Notwithstanding this paragraph (c)(9)(iii), a withholding agent may not rely upon a certification provided by a broker if it knows or has reason to know that the broker has not obtained valid documentation as represented or the information contained in the certification is otherwise inaccurate. A broker that chooses to provide a certification under this paragraph (c)(9)(iii) will be responsible for applying the rules set forth in the regulations under section 1471 and 1472 to the withholding certificates, written statements, or documentary evidence obtained from the payee and shall be liable for any underwithholding that occurs as a result of the broker's failure to reasonably apply such rules.
(iv)
Reliance on documentation and certifications provided between principals and agents
—(A)
In general.
Subject to the conditions under § 1.1474-1(a)(3), a withholding agent is permitted to use an agent to fulfill its chapter 4 obligations and such agent's actions are imputed to the principal. However, an agent that makes a payment pursuant to an agency arrangement (paying agent) is also a withholding agent with respect to the payment unless an exception under § 1.1473-1(d) applies. Therefore, the paying agent will have its own obligation to determine the chapter 4 status of the payee and withhold upon the payment if required. Although a paying agent is generally a withholding agent for purposes of chapter 4, the financial accounts to which it makes payments are not necessarily financial accounts of the paying agent. See the rules under § 1.1471-5(b)(5) to determine when a financial institution maintains a financial account. In addition, the status of a payment as made with respect to an offshore obligation or as a preexisting obligation will be determined based on such obligation's status in relation to the principal. Further, the due diligence required with respect to the payment will be determined by the status of the principal and not the paying agent. Consequently, a payment that is made, for example, by a paying agent that is a foreign entity on behalf of a principal that is a U.S. withholding agent will be subject to the due diligence applicable to the principal. See § 1.1474-1(a)(3) for rules regarding the reporting obligations of a principal and agent in the case of a payment made by an agent of behalf of a principal.
(B)
Reliance upon certification of the principal.
An agent that makes a payment on behalf of a principal that it may treat, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, as a U.S. withholding agent, participating FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI may rely upon a certification provided by the principal indicating that the principal has obtained valid documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of the payee and may rely upon the principal's determination as to the payee's chapter 4 status. In such a case, the agent will be permitted to rely upon the certification provided by the principal when determining whether it is required to withhold on the payment and will not be liable for any underwithholding that occurs as a result of the principal's failure to properly determine the chapter 4 status of the payee unless the agent knows or has reason to know the certification provided by the principal is inaccurate.
(C)
Document sharing.
In lieu of obtaining a certification from the principal as described in paragraph (c)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, or when reliance upon such certification is not permitted, an agent that makes a payment on behalf of a principal may rely upon copies of documentation provided to the principal with respect to the payment. However, in such case, both the principal and the agent are obligated to determine the chapter 4 status of the payee based upon the documentation and ensure that adequate withholding occurs with respect to the payment. While a principal is imputed the knowledge of the agent with respect to the payment, the agent is not imputed the knowledge of the principal.
(D)
Examples
—(1)
Example 1. Paying agent that does not collect documentation.
A fund, P, that is a participating FFI contracts with a U.S. person, A, to make payments to its account holders with respect to their equity interests in P. P contracts with another agent, B, to obtain documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of such account holders. Based on the documentation it collects, B determines that none of P's account holders are subject to withholding. P provides a certification to A indicating that it has obtained documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of P's account holders and that each payee is not subject to withholding under chapter 4. As the actions of B, as P's agent, are attributed to P, P may provide a certification to A indicating that it has determined the chapter 4 status of its payees, even if it is B, and not P, who made the determinations. However, P will be liable for any underwithholding that results from a failure by B to reasonably apply the rules under chapter 4. A is permitted to rely upon the certification provided by P and, accordingly, is not required to withhold on the payments made to P's account holders and would not be liable for any underwithholding that results if the determinations made by B are incorrect unless A had reason to know that chapter 4 status claimed was inaccurate.
(ii)
Example 2. Paying agent that collects documentation.
A fund, P, that is a participating FFI contracts with a U.S. person, A, to make a payment to its account holders on its behalf. P also contracts with A to obtain documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of P's account holders. Based on the documentation it collects, A determines that none of P's account holders are subject to withholding. As the actions of A, as P's agent, are imputed to P, P will be liable for any underwithholding that results from a failure by A to reasonably apply the rules under chapter 4. P is also required to retain the documentation upon which A relied in determining the chapter 4 status of its account holders. Because A performed the due diligence on behalf of P, A will have reason to know if any of the chapter 4 determinations made based on the documentation received were made incorrectly, and, as a withholding agent with respect to the payment, is liable, in addition to P, for any underwithholding that results from an incorrect determination that withholding was not required. This result applies regardless of whether A retains copies of the documentation obtained with respect to P's account holders or receives a certification from P indicating that P has obtained documentation sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of its account holders and that each payee is not subject to withholding under chapter 4.
(v)
Reliance upon documentation for accounts acquired in merger or bulk acquisition for value.
A withholding agent that acquires an account from a predecessor or transferor in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value is permitted to rely upon valid documentation (or copies of valid documentation) collected by the predecessor or transferor. In addition, a withholding agent that acquires an account in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value, other than a related party transaction, from a U.S. withholding agent, a participating FFI that has completed all due diligence required under its agreement with respect to the accounts transferred, or a reporting Model 1 FFI that has completed all due diligence required pursuant to the applicable Model 1 IGA, may also rely upon the predecessor's or transferor's determination of the chapter 4 status of an account holder for a transition period of the lesser of six months from the date of the merger or until the acquirer knows that the claim of status is inaccurate or a change in circumstances occurs. At the end of the transition period, the acquirer will be permitted to rely upon the predecessor's determination as to the chapter 4 status of the account holder only if the documentation that the acquirer has for the account holder, including documentation obtained from the predecessor or transferor, supports the chapter 4 status claimed. An acquirer that discovers at the end of the transition period that the chapter 4 status assigned by the predecessor or transferor to the account holder was incorrect and, as a result, has not withheld as it would have been required to but for its reliance upon the predecessor's determination,
will be required to withhold on payments made after the transition period, if any, to the account holder equal to the amount of tax that should have been withheld during the transition period but for the erroneous classification as to the account holder's status. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(9)(v), a related party transaction is a merger or sale of accounts in which either the acquirer is in the same expanded affiliated group as the predecessor or transferor prior to or after the merger or acquisition or the predecessor or transferor (or shareholders of the predecessor or transferor) obtains a controlling interest in the acquirer or in a newly formed entity created for purposes of the merger or acquisition. See § 1.1471-4(c)(2)(ii)(B) for an additional allowance for a participating FFI to rely upon the determination made by another participating FFI as to the chapter 4 status of an account obtained as part of a merger or bulk acquisition for value.
(d)
Documentation requirements to establish payee's chapter 4 status.
Unless the withholding agent knows or has reason to know otherwise, a withholding agent may rely on the provisions of this paragraph (d) to determine the chapter 4 status of a payee (or other person that receives a payment). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), a withholding agent is required to obtain a valid withholding certificate or a Form W-9 from a payee in order to treat the payee as having a particular chapter 4 status. Paragraphs (d)(1) through (12) of this section indicate when it is appropriate for a withholding agent to rely upon a written statement, documentary evidence, or other information in lieu of a Form W-8 or W-9. Paragraphs (d)(1) through (12) of this section also prescribe additional documentation requirements that must be met in certain cases in order to treat a payee as having a specific chapter 4 status and specific standards of knowledge that apply to a particular payee, in addition to the general standards of knowledge set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This paragraph (d) also provides the circumstances in which special documentation rules are permitted with respect to preexisting obligations. A withholding agent may not rely on documentation described in this paragraph (d) if the documentation is not valid or cannot reliably be associated with the payment pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that such documentation is incorrect or unreliable as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. If the chapter 4 status of a payee cannot be determined under this paragraph (d) based on documentation received, a withholding agent must apply the presumption rules in paragraph (f) to determine the chapter 4 status of the payee.
(1)
Reliance on pre-FATCA Form W-8.
To establish a payee's status as a foreign individual, foreign government, government of a U.S. territory, or international organization, a withholding agent may rely upon a pre-FATCA Form W-8 in lieu of obtaining an updated version of the withholding certificate. This reliance is only available in the case of a payee that is an international organization if such payee is described under section 7701(a)(18). To establish the chapter 4 status of a payee that is not a foreign individual, a foreign government, or an international organization, a withholding agent may, for payments made prior to January 1, 2017, rely upon a pre-FATCA Form W-8 in lieu of obtaining an updated version of the withholding certificate if the withholding agent has one or more forms of documentary evidence described in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii), as necessary, to establish the chapter 4 status of the payee and the withholding agent has obtained any additional documentation or information required for the particular chapter 4 status (such as withholding statements, certifications as to owners, or required documentation for underlying owners), as set forth under the specific payee rules in paragraphs (d)(2) through (12) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) and (iv) of this section for specific requirements applicable when relying upon a pre-FATCA Form W-8 for a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. This paragraph (d)(1) does not apply to nonregistering local banks, FFIs with only low-value accounts, sponsored FFIs,
owner-documented FFIs, territory financial institutions that are not the beneficial owners of the payment, foreign central banks (other than a foreign central bank specifically identified as an exempt beneficial owner under a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA), or international organizations not described under section 7701(a)(18).
(2)
Identification of U.S. persons
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent must treat a payee as a U.S. person, including a payee that is a foreign branch of a U.S. person (other than a branch that is treated as a QI) or is an FFI that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person for tax purposes under section 953(d), if it has a valid Form W-9 associated with the payee or if it must presume the payee is a U.S. person under the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Consistent with the presumption rules in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, a withholding agent must treat a payee that has provided a valid Form W-9 as a specified U.S. person unless the Form W-9 contains a certification that the payee is other than a specified U.S. person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a withholding agent receiving a Form W-9 indicating that the payee is other than a specified U.S. person must treat the payee as a specified U.S. person if the withholding agent knows or has reason to know that the payee's claim that it is other than a specified U.S. person is incorrect. For example, a withholding agent that receives a Form W-9 from a payee that is an individual would be required to treat the payee as a specified U.S. person regardless of whether the Form W-9 indicates that the payee is not a specified U.S. person, because an individual that is a U.S. person is not excepted from the definition of a specified U.S. person.
(ii)
Reliance on documentary evidence.
A withholding agent may also treat the payee as a U.S. person that is other than a specified U.S. person if the withholding agent has documentary evidence described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(C) and (D) of this section or general documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) that both establishes that the payee is a U.S. person and establishes (either through the documentation or the application of the rules in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) or paragraph (f)(3) of this section) that the payee is an exempt recipient. For purposes of the previous sentence, an exempt recipient means with respect to a withholding agent other than a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, an exempt recipient under § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) or, with respect to a withholding agent that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, a U.S. person other than a specified U.S. person as described under § 1.1473-1(c).
(iii)
Preexisting obligations.
As an alternative to applying the rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, a withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to a preexisting obligation may treat a payee as a U.S. person if it has a notation in its files that it has previously reviewed a Form W-9 that established that the payee is a U.S. person and has retained the payee's TIN. A withholding agent, other than a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, may also treat a payee of a payment with respect to a preexisting obligation as a U.S. person if it has previously classified the payee as a U.S. person for purposes of chapter 3 or 61 and established (through the documentation or the application of the rules in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)) that the payee is an exempt recipient for purposes of chapter 61.
(3)
Identification of individuals that are foreign persons
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as an individual that is a foreign person if the withholding agent has a withholding certificate identifying the payee as such a person.
(ii)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payee as an individual that is a foreign person if it obtains documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of status as a foreign individual (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i)) or if the payee is presumed to be an individual that is a foreign person under the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
(4)
Identification of participating FFIs and registered deemed-compliant FFIs
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) through
(iv) or paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI only if the withholding agent has a withholding certificate identifying the payee as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI), and the withholding certificate contains a GIIN described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section that is verified against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section (indicating when a withholding agent may rely upon a GIIN). For when a withholding agent may treat a payee as a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation, see paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this section. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section for additional requirements that apply to a valid withholding certificate provided by a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment.
(ii)
Exception for payments made prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to preexisting obligations (transitional).
For payments made prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to a preexisting obligation, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI), if the payee has provided the withholding agent with a pre-FATCA Form W-8 and (either orally or in writing) its GIIN and has indicated whether it is a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (or whether such branch or disregarded entity is treated as a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI), and the withholding agent has verified the GIIN of the FFI, branch, or disregarded entity, as the context requires, in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(iii)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment, other than a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, with respect to an offshore obligation may treat a payee as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI), if the payee provides the withholding agent with its GIIN and states whether the payee is a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI, and the withholding agent verifies the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. A withholding agent that makes a payment of U.S. source FDAP income with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payee as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI) if—
(A) The payee provides the withholding agent with—
(
1
) A written statement that contains the payee's GIIN, states that the payee is the beneficial owner of the payment, and indicates whether the payee is treated as a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI, as appropriate; and
(
2
) Documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status; and
(B) The withholding agent verifies the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(iv)
Exceptions for payments to reporting Model 1 FFIs.
(A) For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, a withholding agent may treat a payee that is an FFI or branch of an FFI (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI) as a reporting Model 1 FFI if it receives a withholding certificate from the payee indicating that the payee is a reporting Model 1 FFI and the country in which the payee is a reporting Model 1 FFI, regardless of whether the certificate contains a GIIN for the payee.
(B) For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, with respect to a preexisting obligation, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a reporting Model 1 FFI if it obtains a pre-FATCA Form W-8 from the payee, and the payee indicates (either orally or in writing) that it is a reporting Model 1 FFI and the country in which it is a reporting Model 1 FFI, regardless of
whether the certificate contains a GIIN for the payee.
(C) For payments made prior to January 1, 2015, with respect to an offshore obligation, a withholding agent may treat a payee as a reporting Model 1 FFI if the payee informs the withholding agent that the payee is a reporting Model 1 FFI and provides the country in which the payee is a reporting Model 1 FFI. In the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, such payee must also provide a written statement that it is the beneficial owner and documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(D) For payments made on or after January 1, 2015, that do not constitute U.S. source FDAP income, the withholding agent may continue to treat a payee as a reporting Model 1 FFI if the payee provides the withholding agent with its GIIN, either orally or in writing, and the withholding agent verifies the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(v)
Reason to know.
See paragraph (e) of this section for when a withholding agent will have reason to know that a withholding certificate or written statement provided by a payee claiming status as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is incorrect or invalid.
(vi)
Sponsored investment entities and sponsored controlled foreign corporations
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation if the withholding agent has a withholding certificate identifying the payee as a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation (as applicable) and the withholding certificate includes the GIIN of the sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation entity (as applicable), which the withholding agent has verified against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(B)
Payments made prior to January 1, 2017 (transitional).
For payments made prior to January 1, 2017, a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation may provide the GIIN of its sponsoring entity on the withholding certificate, which the withholding agent must verify against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(C)
Payments made after December 31, 2016, to payees documented prior to January 1, 2017.
For a payment made after December 31, 2016, to a payee that the withholding agent has documented prior to January 1, 2017, as a sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation with a valid withholding certificate that includes the GIIN of the sponsoring entity, the withholding agent must obtain and verify the GIIN of the sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section by March 31, 2017. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a GIIN is not required for a payee that provides a valid withholding certificate prior to January 1, 2017, that identifies the payee as a sponsored FFI and includes the GIIN of the sponsoring entity if the withholding agent determines, based on information provided on the withholding certificate, that the sponsored entity is resident, organized, or located in a jurisdiction that is treated as having a Model 1 IGA in effect. A withholding agent required to obtain a GIIN of the sponsored investment entity or sponsored controlled foreign corporation under this paragraph (d)(4)(vi)(C) may obtain such GIIN by oral or written confirmation (including by email) rather than obtaining a new withholding certificate, provided that the withholding agent retains a record of the confirmation, which will become part of the withholding certificate.
(5)
Identification of certified deemed-compliant FFIs
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5), a withholding agent may treat a payee as a certified deemed-compliant FFI, other than a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle, if the withholding agent has a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as a certified deemed-compliant FFI, and the withholding certificate contains a certification by the payee that it meets
the requirements to qualify as the type of certified deemed-compliant FFI identified on the withholding certificate. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section for additional requirements that apply to a valid withholding certificate provided by a certified deemed-compliant FFI that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment, or by a U.S. branch of a certified deemed-compliant FFI.
(ii)
Sponsored, closely held investment vehicles
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle described in § 1.1471-5(f)(2)(iii) if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle and includes the sponsoring entity's GIIN, which the withholding agent has verified against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In addition to the standards of knowledge rules indicated in paragraph (e) of this section, a withholding agent will have reason to know that the payee is not a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle described in § 1.1471-5(f)(2)(iii) if its AML due diligence indicates that the payee has in excess of 20 individual investors that own direct and/or indirect interests in the payee. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section for additional requirements that apply to a valid withholding certificate provided by a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary with respect to the payment, or by a U.S. branch of such vehicle.
(B)
Offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat a payee as a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle if it obtains a written statement that indicates that the payee is a sponsored, closely held investment vehicle, and provides the sponsoring entity's GIIN, which the withholding agent has verified in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the written statement must also indicate that the payee is the beneficial owner and must be supplemented with documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(iii)
Certain investment entities that do not maintain financial accounts
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as an investment entity that does not maintain financial accounts described in § 1.1471-5(f)(2)(v) if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as an investment entity that does not maintain financial accounts. In addition to the standards of knowledge rules indicated in paragraph (e) of this section, a withholding agent will have reason to know that the payee is not an investment entity that does not maintain financial accounts described in § 1.1471-5(f)(2)(v) if its AML due diligence documentation indicates that the payee has financial accounts.
(B)
Offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat a payee as an investment advisor and investment manager described in § 1.1471-5(f)(2)(v) if it obtains a written statement that indicates that the payee is an investment advisor and investment manager. In the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the written statement must also indicate that the payee is the beneficial owner and must be supplemented with documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(6)
Identification of owner-documented FFIs
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as an owner-documented FFI if all the following requirements of paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(A) through (F) of this section are met. A withholding agent may not rely upon a withholding certificate to treat a payee as an owner-documented FFI, either in whole or in part, if the withholding certificate does not contain all of the information and associated documentation required by paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(A), (C), and (D) of this section.
(A) The withholding agent has a withholding certificate that identifies
the payee as an owner-documented FFI that is not acting as an intermediary;
(B) The withholding agent is a U.S. financial institution, participating FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI that agrees pursuant to § 1.1471-5(f)(3) to act as a designated withholding agent with respect to the payee;
(C) The payee submits to the withholding agent an FFI owner reporting statement that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section;
(D) The payee submits to the withholding agent valid documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section with respect to each person identified on the FFI owner reporting statement;
(E) The withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the payee (or any other FFI that is an owner of the payee and that the designated withholding agent is treating as an owner-documented FFI) maintains any financial account for a nonparticipating FFI; and
(F) The withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the payee is a member of an expanded affiliated group with any FFI that is a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company, or that the FFI has any specified U.S. persons that own an equity interest in the FFI or a debt interest (other than a debt interest that is not a financial account or that has a balance or value not exceeding $50,000) in the FFI other than those identified on the FFI owner reporting statement described in paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Auditor's letter substitute.
A payee may, in lieu of providing an FFI owner reporting statement and documentation for each owner of the FFI as described in paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(C) and (D) of this section, provide a letter from an auditor or an attorney that is licensed in the United States or whose firm has a location in the United States, signed no more than four years prior to the date of the payment, that certifies that the firm or representative has reviewed the payee's documentation with respect to all of its owners and debt holders described in paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section in accordance with § 1.1471-4(c) and that the payee meets the requirements of § 1.1471-5(f)(3). The payee must also provide an FFI owner reporting statement and a Form W-9, with any applicable waiver, for each specified U.S. person that owns a direct or indirect interest in the payee or that holds debt interests described in paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section. A withholding agent may rely upon the letter described in this paragraph (d)(6)(ii) if it does not know or have reason to know that any of the information contained in the letter is unreliable or incorrect.
(iii)
Documentation for owners and debt holders of payee.
Acceptable documentation for an individual owning an equity interest in the payee or a debt holder described in paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section means a valid withholding certificate, valid Form W-9 (including any necessary waiver), or documentary evidence establishing the foreign status of the individual as set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section (regardless of whether the payment is made with respect to an offshore obligation). Acceptable documentation for a specified U.S. person means a valid Form W-9 (including any necessary waiver). Acceptable documentation for all other persons owning an equity or debt interest in the payee means documentation described in this paragraph (d), applicable to the chapter 4 status claimed by the person. The rules for reliably associating a payment with a withholding certificate or documentary evidence set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the rules for payee documentation provided in this paragraph (d), and the standards of knowledge set forth in paragraph (e) of this section will apply to documentation submitted by the owners and debt holders by substituting the phrase “owner of the payee” or “debt holder” for “payee.”
(iv)
Content of FFI owner reporting statement.
The FFI owner reporting statement provided by an owner-documented FFI must contain the information required by this paragraph (d)(6)(iv) and is subject to the general rules applicable to all withholding statements described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. An FFI that is a partnership, simple trust, or grantor trust may substitute an NWP withholding statement described in
§ 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iv) or a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding statement described in § 1.1441-5(e)(5)(iv) for the FFI owner reporting statement, provided that the NWP withholding certificate or foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate contains all of the information required in this paragraph (d)(6)(iv). The owner reporting statement will expire on the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the statement was provided to the withholding agent unless an exception in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section (for example, accounts with a balance or value of $1,000,000 or less) or this paragraph (d)(6) applies. The owner-documented FFI will also be required to provide the withholding agent with an updated owner reporting statement if there is a change in circumstances as required under paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(E) of this section.
(A) The FFI owner reporting statement must provide the following information:
(
1
) The name, address, TIN (if any), and chapter 4 status of every individual and specified U.S. person that owns a direct or indirect equity interest in the payee (looking through all entities other than specified U.S. persons).

(
3
) Any other information the withholding agent reasonably requests in order to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4.
(B) The information on the FFI owner reporting statement may contain names of equity and debt holders that are prepopulated by the withholding agent based on prior information provided to the withholding agent by the payee if the prepopulated form instructs the payee to amend the statement if the contents are inaccurate, incomplete, or have changed, and the payee confirms in writing that the FFI owner reporting statement submitted to the withholding agent is accurate and complete.
(C) The FFI owner reporting statement may be submitted in any form that meets the requirements of this paragraph, including a form used for purposes of AML due diligence.
(v)
Exception for preexisting obligations (transitional).
A withholding agent may treat a payment made prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to a preexisting obligation as made to an owner-documented FFI if the withholding agent has collected, for purposes of satisfying its AML due diligence, documentation with respect to each individual and specified U.S. person that owns a direct or indirect interest in the payee, other than an interest as a creditor, within four years of the date of payment, that documentation is sufficient to satisfy the AML due diligence requirements of the jurisdiction in which the withholding agent maintains the account, the withholding agent has sufficient information to report all specified U.S. persons that own an interest in the payee, and the withholding agent does not know, or have reason to know, that any nonparticipating FFI owns an equity interest in the FFI or that any nonparticipating FFI or specified U.S. person owns a debt interest in the FFI constituting a financial account in excess of $50,000.
(vi)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that is making a payment, other than a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, with respect to an offshore obligation may, in lieu of obtaining a withholding certificate as otherwise required under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(A) of this section, rely upon a written statement that indicates the payee meets the requirements to qualify as an owner-documented FFI under § 1.1471-5(f)(3) and is not acting as an intermediary, if the withholding agent provides a written notice to the payee indicating that the payee is required to update the written statement and all
associated documentation (such as the FFI owner reporting statement and underlying documentation) within 30 days of a change in circumstances.
(vii)
Exception for certain offshore obligations of $1,000,000 or less
—(A) A withholding agent may treat the payment as being made to an owner-documented FFI if—
(
1
) The payment is made with respect to an offshore obligation that has a balance or value not exceeding $1,000,000 on the later of June 30, 2014, or the last day of the calendar year in which the account was opened, and the last day of each subsequent year preceding the payment, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4);
(
2
) The withholding agent has collected documentation or a certification as to the payee's owners (either for purposes of complying with its AML due diligence or for purposes of satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (d)(6)(vii)) sufficient to identify every individual and specified U.S. person that owns any direct or indirect interest in the payee (other than an interest as a creditor) and determine the chapter 4 status of such person;
(
3
) The documentation described in paragraph (d)(6)(vii)(A)(
2
) of this section is sufficient to satisfy the AML due diligence requirements of the jurisdiction in which the withholding agent maintains the account (and such jurisdiction is a FATF-compliant jurisdiction);
(
4
) The withholding agent has sufficient information to report all specified U.S. persons that own an interest in the payee in accordance with § 1.1474-1(d); and
(
5
) The withholding agent does not know, or have reason to know, that the payee has any contingent beneficiaries or designated classes with unidentified beneficiaries or owners, that any nonparticipating FFI owns a direct or indirect equity interest in the payee, or that any specified U.S. persons or nonparticipating FFIs own a debt interest constituting a financial account in excess of $50,000 in the payee (other than specified U.S. persons that the withholding agent has sufficient information to report).
(B) For example, a withholding agent that is required to obtain a certification from the payee identifying all persons owning an interest in the payee as part of its AML due diligence will not be required to obtain an FFI owner reporting statement, provided the other conditions of this paragraph (d)(6)(vii) are met. On the other hand, a withholding agent that has only obtained documentation for persons owning a certain threshold percentage of the payee will be required to obtain additional documentation to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d)(6)(vii). A withholding agent that treats a payee as an owner-documented FFI pursuant to this paragraph (d)(6)(vii) will not be required to obtain new documentation, including the FFI owner reporting statement, until there is a change in circumstances or until the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000 on the last day of the calendar year.

(ii)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat a payee as a nonreporting IGA FFI if it can reliably associate the payment with a written statement identifying the payee (or the
relevant branch of the payee) as a nonreporting IGA FFI and, with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the written statement indicates that the payee is the beneficial owner of the income and is accompanied by documentary evidence supporting a claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section). A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may also treat a payee as a nonreporting IGA FFI if the withholding agent has a permanent residence address for the payee, or an address of the relevant branch of the payee, and has obtained a notification, either orally or in writing, indicating that the payee is not acting as an intermediary and general documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) that provides the withholding agent with sufficient information to reasonably determine that the payee is an entity listed as a nonreporting IGA FFI pursuant to a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA.

Exception for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment, other than a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation may treat the payee as a foreign government, government of a U.S. territory, international organization, or foreign central bank of issue if—

A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may also treat the payment as made to a retirement fund if it obtains general documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) that provides the withholding agent with sufficient information to establish that the payee is a retirement fund meeting the requirements of § 1.1471-6(f).
(C)
Exception for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation, may treat the payee as a retirement fund described in § 1.1471-6(f) if the withholding agent has general documentary evidence or preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) or (B)) that establishes that the payee is a foreign entity that qualifies as a retirement fund in the country in which the payee is organized.

(B)
Exception for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation may treat the payee as a territory financial institution if the withholding agent receives written notification, whether signed or not, that the payee is the beneficial owner of the payment and the withholding agent has general documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) or preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) establishing that the payee was organized or incorporated under the laws of any U.S. territory and is a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company.

A withholding agent that obtains the documentation described in the preceding sentence may treat the territory financial institution as the payee if the withholding certificate contains a certification that the territory financial institution agrees to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment. If the withholding certificate does not contain such a certification, then the withholding agent must treat the person on whose behalf the territory financial institution receives the payment as the payee. See paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section for additional documentation that must accompany the withholding certificate of the territory financial institution in this case.
(iii)
Reason to know.
In addition to the general standards of knowledge described in paragraph (e) of this section, a withholding agent will have reason to know that an entity is not a territory financial institution if the withholding agent has: a current residence or mailing address, either in the entity's account files or on documentation provided by the payee, for the entity that is outside the U.S. territory in which the entity claims to be organized; a current telephone number for the payee that has a country code other than the country code for the U.S. territory or has an area code other than the area code(s) of the applicable U.S. territory and no telephone number for the payee in the applicable U.S. territory; or standing instructions for the withholding agent to pay amounts from its account to an address or account outside the applicable U.S. territory.

Reason to know.
A withholding agent must cease to treat a foreign organization's claim that it is a section 501(c) organization as valid beginning on the earlier of the date on which such agent knows that the IRS has given notice to such foreign organization that it is not a section 501(c) organization or 90 days after the date on which the IRS gives notice to the public that such foreign organization is not a section 501(c) organization.

) Has general documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section), preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section), or a prospectus establishing that the payee is an entity other than a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company; and
(
3
) Is subject, with respect to such obligation, to the laws of a FATF-compliant jurisdiction and as part of its AML due diligence has not identified any owners of the payee that are not bona fide residents of the U.S. territory in which the payee is organized.
(B)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat a payment as being made to an excepted territory NFFE described in § 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iii) if it has—
(
1
) A written statement providing that the payee is an entity other than a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company, was organized in a U.S. territory, and is wholly owned by one or more bona fide residents of that U.S. territory, and, with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the written statement must indicate that the payee is the beneficial owner of the income and be accompanied by documentary evidence supporting a claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section); or
(
2
) General documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of
this section) or a prospectus establishing that the payee is an entity other than a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company, establishing that the payee was organized in a U.S. territory, and establishing that the payee is wholly owned by one or more bona fide residents of that U.S. territory.
(C)
Exception for preexisting offshore obligations of $1,000,000 or less.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation with a balance or value not exceeding $1,000,000 on June 30, 2014 (or the effective date of the FFI agreement for a withholding agent that is a participating FFI) and the last day of each subsequent calendar year preceding the payment, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii), may rely upon its review conducted for AML due diligence purposes to determine whether the owners of the payee are bona fide residents of the U.S. territory in which the payee is organized, in lieu of obtaining a written statement or documentary evidence described in paragraph (d)(11)(viii)(B) of this section. The preceding sentence applies only if the withholding agent is subject, with respect to such account, to the laws of a FATF-compliant jurisdiction and has identified the residence of the owners. The withholding agent relying upon this paragraph (d)(11)(viii)(C) must still obtain a written statement, documentary evidence (as provided in paragraph (d)(11)(viii)(B) of this section), or preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) establishing that the payee is an entity other than a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company organized in a U.S. territory.
(ix)
Identification of active NFFEs.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as an active NFFE described in § 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iv) if it has a withholding certificate identifying the payee as an active NFFE.
(A)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payee as an active NFFE if the withholding agent has—
(
1
) General documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) providing sufficient information to determine that the payee is a foreign entity engaged in an active trade or business other than that of a financial institution; or
(
2
) A written statement stating that the payee is a foreign entity engaged in an active business other than that of a financial institution and, in the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(B)
Exception for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation may treat the payee as an active NFFE if the withholding agent has preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) that unambiguously indicates that the payee is a foreign entity engaged in a trade or business other than that of a financial institution and, in the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(C)
Limit on reason to know.
A withholding agent relying on documentary evidence to determine that a payee is an active NFFE will not be required to determine that the payee meets the income and asset thresholds but rather must determine only that the payee is primarily engaged in a business other than that of a financial institution.
(x)
Identifying a direct reporting NFFE (other than a sponsored direct reporting NFFE)
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payment as having been made to a direct reporting NFFE (other than a sponsored direct reporting NFFE) if it has a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as a direct reporting NFFE and the withholding certificate contains a GIIN for the payee that is verified against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this
section (indicating when a withholding agent may rely upon a GIIN).
(B)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payment as made to a direct reporting NFFE if the withholding agent has—
(
1
)(
i
) General documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) for the payee providing sufficient information to determine that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution; or
(
ii
) A written statement that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution and, for a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section), and
(
2
) Received (either orally or in writing) a GIIN from the direct reporting NFFE and has verified the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(C)
Special rule for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation may treat the payee as a direct reporting NFFE if the withholding agent has preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) providing sufficient information to determine that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution and it has received (either orally or in writing) a GIIN from the direct reporting NFFE and has verified the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(xi)
Identifying a sponsored direct reporting NFFE
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payment as having been made to a sponsored direct reporting NFFE if it has a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE and the withholding certificate includes the sponsored direct reporting NFFE's GIIN, which the withholding agent has verified against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (indicating when a withholding agent may rely upon a GIIN).
(
1
)
Payments made prior to January 1, 2017 (transitional).
For payments prior to January 1, 2017, a sponsored direct reporting NFFE may provide the GIIN of its sponsoring entity on the withholding certificate, which the withholding agent must verify against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section.
(
2
)
Payments made after December 31, 2016, to payees documented prior to January 1, 2017.
For a payment made after December 31, 2016, to a payee that the withholding agent has documented prior to January 1, 2017, as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE with a valid withholding certificate that includes the GIIN of the sponsoring entity, the withholding agent must obtain and verify the GIIN of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE against the published IRS FFI list in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section by March 31, 2017. A withholding agent required to obtain a GIIN of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE in the preceding sentence may obtain such GIIN by oral or written confirmation (including by email) rather than obtaining a new withholding certificate, provided that the withholding agent retains a record of the confirmation, which will become part of the withholding certificate.
(B)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payment as made to a sponsored direct reporting NFFE if the withholding agent has—
(
1
) A written statement that the payee is a foreign entity that is a sponsored direct reporting NFFE and, for a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section), and
(
2
) Received (either orally or in writing) the GIIN of the sponsored direct reporting NFFE and has verified the GIIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. For payments prior to January 1, 2017, such requirement may be fulfilled by receiving (either orally or in writing) the GIIN of the sponsoring entity to the extent
that the sponsored direct reporting NFFE has not obtained a GIIN.
(xii)
Identification of excepted inter-affiliate FFI
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may treat a payee as an excepted inter-affiliate FFI described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(iv) if it has obtained a withholding certificate identifying the payee as such an entity.
(B)
Offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payment as made to an excepted inter-affiliate FFI described in § 1.1471-5(e)(5)(iv) if the withholding agent obtains a written statement in which the payee certifies that it is a foreign entity operating as an excepted inter-affiliate FFI and that it is a member of an expanded affiliated group of participating FFIs or registered deemed-compliant FFIs. In the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, the written statement must also indicate that the payee is the beneficial owner and must be supplemented with documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(C)
Reason to know.
A withholding agent that is not a member of the payee's expanded affiliated group has reason to know that an entity is not an excepted inter-affiliate FFI if it makes any payments (other than a payment of bank deposit interest) to such entity.
(12)
Identification of passive NFFEs.
A withholding agent may treat a payment as having been made to a passive NFFE if it has a withholding certificate that identifies the payee as a passive NFFE.
(i)
Exception for offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation may treat the payment as made to a passive NFFE if the withholding agent has—
(A) General documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) for the payee providing sufficient information to determine that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution; or
(B) A written statement that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution and, for a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(ii)
Special rule for preexisting offshore obligations.
A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation may treat the payee as a passive NFFE if the withholding agent has preexisting account documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) providing sufficient information to determine that the payee is a foreign entity that is not a financial institution and, with respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income, documentary evidence supporting the payee's claim of foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(iii)
Required owner certification for passive NFFEs
—(A)
In general.
A passive NFFE will be required to provide to the withholding agent either a written certification (contained on a withholding certificate or in a written statement) that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or the name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE, to avoid being withheld upon under § 1.1472-1(b).
(B)
Exception for preexisting obligations of $1,000,000 or less (transitional).
A withholding agent that makes a payment prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to a preexisting obligation with a balance or value not exceeding $1,000,000 on June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2015, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii), may rely upon its review conducted for AML due diligence purposes to identify any substantial U.S. owners of the payee in lieu of obtaining the certification or information required in paragraph (d)(12)(iii)(A) of this section if the withholding agent is subject, with respect to such obligation, to the laws of a FATF-compliant jurisdiction and has identified the residence of any controlling persons (within the meaning of the withholding agent's AML due diligence rules). A withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation with a balance or value not exceeding $1,000,000 on June 30, 2014, (or
the effective date of the FFI agreement for a withholding agent that is a participating FFI) and the last day of each subsequent calendar year preceding the payment, applying the aggregation principles of § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii), may rely upon its review conducted for AML due diligence purposes to identify any substantial U.S. owners of the payee in lieu of obtaining the certification or information required in paragraph (d)(12)(iii)(A) of this section if the withholding agent is subject, with respect to such obligation, to the laws of a FATF-compliant jurisdiction and has identified the residence of any controlling persons (within the meaning of the withholding agent's AML due diligence rules).
(e)
Standards of knowledge
—(1)
In general.
The standards of knowledge discussed in this section apply for purposes of determining the chapter 4 status of payees, beneficial owners, intermediaries, flow-through entities, and persons that own an interest in an owner-documented FFI. A withholding agent shall be liable for tax, interest, and penalties to the extent provided under section 1474 and the regulations under that section if it fails to withhold the correct amount despite knowing or having reason to know the amount required to be withheld. A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate the payment with documentation and fails to act in accordance with the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section may also be liable for tax, interest, and penalties. See paragraph (e)(4) in this section for the specific standards of knowledge applicable to a person's specific claims of chapter 4 status.
(2)
Notification by the IRS.
A withholding agent that has received notification by the IRS that a claim of status as a U.S. person, a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or other entity entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under section 1471 or 1472 is incorrect knows that such a claim is incorrect beginning on the date that is 30 days after the date the notice is received.
(3)
GIIN verification
—(i)
In general.
A withholding agent that has received a payee's claim of status as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and that is required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section to confirm that the FFI or branch thereof (including an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from the FFI) claiming status as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI has a GIIN that appears on the published IRS FFI list, has reason to know that such payee is not such a financial institution if the payee's name (including a name reasonably similar to the name the withholding agent has on file for the payee) and GIIN do not appear on the most recently published IRS FFI list within 90 days of the date that the claim is made. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(i), the GIIN that the withholding agent must confirm is, with respect to a payee that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, the GIIN assigned to the FFI identifying its country of residence for tax purposes (or place of organization if the FFI has no country of residence) or, with respect to a payment that is made to a branch (including a disregarded entity) of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI located outside of the FFI's country of residence or organization, the GIIN of the branch (or disregarded entity) receiving the payment. The withholding agent will have reason to know that a withholdable payment is made to a branch (including a disregarded entity) of a participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is not itself a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI when the withholding agent is directed to make the payment to an address in a jurisdiction other than that of the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (or branch (including a disregarded entity) of such FFI) that is identified as the FFI (or branch (including a disregarded entity) of such FFI) that is supposed to receive the payment and for which the FFI's GIIN is not confirmed as described in the preceding sentence. The preceding sentence does not apply to an FFI that is an investment entity. If an FFI (other than an investment entity) directs the withholding agent to make the payment to an account held by the FFI and maintained by another financial institution, the FFI must provide to
the withholding agent a statement in writing that the FFI is not directing the payment to any branch of such FFI that is not a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI. An FFI whose registration with the IRS as a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI is in process but has not yet received a GIIN may provide a withholding agent with a Form W-8 claiming the chapter 4 status it applied for and writing “applied for” in the box for the GIIN. In such case, the withholding agent will have 90 days from the date it receives the Form W-8 to obtain a GIIN and to verify the accuracy of the GIIN against the published IRS FFI list before it has reason to know that the payee is not a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. If an FFI is removed from the published IRS FFI list, the withholding agent knows that such FFI is not a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI on the earlier of the date that the withholding agent discovers that the FFI has been removed from the list or the date that is one year from the date the FFI's GIIN was actually removed from the list.
(ii)
Special rules for reporting Model 1 FFIs.
Prior to January 1, 2015, a withholding agent that receives an FFI's claim of status as a reporting Model 1 FFI will not be required to confirm that the FFI has a GIIN that appears on the published IRS FFI list. A withholding agent has reason to know that the FFI is not a reporting Model 1 FFI if the withholding agent does not have a permanent residence address for the FFI, or an address of the relevant branch of the FFI, located in the country in which the FFI claims to be a reporting Model 1 FFI, or the withholding agent is making a payment to a branch of the FFI at an address in a country that does not have in effect a Model 1 IGA.
(iii)
Special rules for direct reporting NFFEs.
A withholding agent that has received a payee's claim of status as a direct reporting NFFE and that is required under paragraph (d)(11)(x) of this section to confirm that the entity claiming status as a direct reporting NFFE has a GIIN that appears on the published IRS FFI list, has reason to know that such payee is not such a NFFE if the payee's name (including a name reasonably similar to the name the withholding agent has on file for the payee) and GIIN do not appear on the most recently published IRS FFI list within 90 days of the date that the claim is made. A payee whose registration with the IRS as a direct reporting NFFE is in process but has not yet received a GIIN may provide a withholding agent with a Form W-8 claiming the chapter 4 status it applied for and writing “applied for” in the box for the GIIN. In such case, the withholding agent will have 90 days from the date it receives the Form W-8 to verify the accuracy of the GIIN against the published IRS FFI list before it has reason to know that the payee is not a direct reporting NFFE. If a direct reporting NFFE is removed from the published IRS FFI list, the withholding agent knows that such NFFE is not a direct reporting NFFE on the earlier of the date that the withholding agent discovers that the NFFE has been removed from the list or the date that is one year from the date the NFFE's GIIN was actually removed from the list.
(iv)
Special rules for sponsored direct reporting NFFEs and sponsoring entities
—(A)
Sponsored direct reporting NFFEs.
A withholding agent that has received a payee's claim of status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE and that is required under paragraph (d)(11)(xi) of this section to confirm that the entity claiming status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE has a GIIN that appears on the published IRS FFI list, has reason to know that such payee is not such a NFFE if its name (including a name reasonably similar to the name the withholding agent has on file for the payee) and GIIN do not appear on the most recently published IRS FFI list within 90 days of the date that the claim is made. A sponsored direct reporting NFFE whose registration with the IRS as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE is in process but has not yet received a GIIN may provide a withholding agent with a Form W-8 claiming the chapter 4 status it applied for and writing “applied for” in the box for the GIIN. In such case, the withholding agent will have 90 days from the date it receives the Form W-8 to
verify the accuracy of the GIIN against the published IRS FFI list before it has reason to know that the payee is not a sponsored direct reporting NFFE. If a sponsored direct reporting NFFE is removed from the published IRS FFI list, the withholding agent knows that such NFFE is not a sponsored direct reporting NFFE on the earlier of the date that the withholding agent discovers that the sponsored entity has been removed from the list or the date that is one year from the date the sponsored entity's GIIN was actually removed from the list.
(B)
Sponsoring entities (transitional).
For payments made prior to January 1, 2017, a withholding agent that has received a payee's claim of status as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE has reason to know that such payee is not such a NFFE if the name of its sponsoring entity (including a name reasonably similar to the name the withholding agent has on file for the sponsoring entity) and the GIIN of its sponsoring entity do not appear on the most recently published IRS FFI list within 90 days of the date that the claim is made. A sponsoring entity whose registration with the IRS is in process but has not yet received a GIIN may provide a withholding agent with a Form W-8 claiming the chapter 4 status it applied for and writing “applied for” in the box for the GIIN. In such case, the withholding agent will have 90 days from the date it receives the Form W-8 to verify the accuracy of the GIIN against the published IRS FFI list before it has reason to know that the payee is not a sponsored direct reporting NFFE. If the sponsoring entity of the NFFE is removed from the published IRS FFI list, the withholding agent knows that such NFFE is not a sponsored direct reporting NFFE on the earlier of the date that the withholding agent discovers that the sponsoring entity has been removed from the list or the date that is one year from the date the sponsoring entity's GIIN was actually removed from the list.
(4)
Reason to know.
A withholding agent has reason to know that a claim of chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect if its knowledge of relevant facts or statements contained in the withholding certificate or other documentation is such that a reasonably prudent person in the position of the withholding agent would question the claim being made. For an obligation other than a preexisting obligation, a withholding agent has reason to know that a person's claim of chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect if any information contained in its account opening files or other customer account files, including documentation collected for AML due diligence purposes, conflicts with the chapter 4 status being claimed. A withholding agent will not, however, have reason to know that a person's claim of chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect based on documentation collected for AML due diligence purposes until the date that is 30 days after the obligation is created. In addition to the specific standards of knowledge set forth in this paragraph (e) regarding a person's claim of chapter 4 status, a withholding agent is also required to apply any specific standards of knowledge applicable to the chapter 4 status claimed as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. A withholding agent that has obtained documentation to reliably associate a payment to a foreign person under paragraph (c) of this section has reason to know that the person's claim of foreign status is unreliable or incorrect only to the extent provided in this paragraph (e)(4). See also § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for requirements that apply when a change in circumstances occurs for purposes of chapter 3 and the related grace period allowed under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv). The limits on reason to know for multiple obligations held by the same person set forth in § 1.1441-7(b)(11) shall apply by substituting the term
chapter 4 status
for the term
foreign status.
See § 1.1471-3(e)(4)(vii) for the limits on reason to know with respect to a preexisting obligation.
(i)
Reason to know regarding an entity's chapter 4 status.
A withholding agent has reason to know that a withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence provided by or on behalf of an entity is unreliable or incorrect if there is information on the face of the documentation or in the withholding agent's account files that
conflicts with the entity's claim regarding its chapter 4 status. For example, a withholding agent has reason to know that an entity's claim that it is an excepted NFFE is unreliable or incorrect if the withholding agent has obtained a financial statement or credit report for AML purposes that indicates that the entity is engaged in business as a financial institution. See also paragraph (e)(4) of this section for the 30-day period before a withholding agent has reason to know a claim is unreliable or incorrect based on AML information. Further, a withholding agent that has classified an entity as engaged in a particular type of business based on its records, such as through the use of a standardized industry coding system, AML or other regulatory purpose that requires the withholding agent to periodically monitor and periodically update the business classification based on the withholding agent's records, the withholding agent has reason to know that the chapter 4 status claimed by the entity is unreliable or incorrect only if the entity's claim conflicts with the withholding agent's classification of the entity's business type.
(ii)
Reason to know applicable to withholding certificates
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent has reason to know that a withholding certificate provided by a person is unreliable or incorrect if the withholding certificate is incomplete with respect to any item on the certificate that is relevant to the claims made by the person, the withholding certificate contains any information that is inconsistent with the person's claim, the withholding agent has other account information that is inconsistent with the person's claim, or the withholding certificate lacks information necessary to establish entitlement to an exemption from withholding for chapter 4 purposes. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A), a withholding agent that is a financial institution or other entity described in § 1.1441-7(b)(3) and that has obtained a withholding certificate to reliably associate a payment to a foreign person under paragraph (c) of this section has reason to know that the person's claim of foreign status is unreliable or incorrect only if there are U.S. indicia, as described in § 1.1441-7(b)(5), associated with the person and for which appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia has not been obtained in accordance with § 1.1441-7(b) within 90 days of when the U.S. indicia was first identified by the withholding agent. See also § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for requirements that apply when a change in circumstances occurs for purposes of chapter 3 and the related grace period allowed under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv). A withholding agent that relies on an agent to review and maintain a withholding certificate is considered to know or have reason to know the facts within the knowledge of the agent.
(B)
Withholding certificate provided by an FFI.
A withholding agent that obtains a withholding certificate to reliably associate a payment to a participating FFI, a registered deemed-compliant FFI, a sponsoring entity, or a sponsored FFI does not need to apply the standards of knowledge described in § 1.1441-7(b)(5) if it has confirmed the FFI's GIIN on the current published IRS FFI list, in the manner described under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, within 90 days of receipt of the withholding certificate.
(iii)
Reason to know applicable to written statements.
A withholding agent must apply the standards of knowledge applicable to withholding certificates, as set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, to determine whether it has reason to know that a written statement is unreliable or incorrect in terms of establishing a person's claim of foreign status. The rules under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) shall be applied by substituting the term
written statement
for the term
withholding certificate.
(iv)
Reason to know applicable to documentary evidence
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent may not treat documentary evidence provided by a person as valid if the documentary evidence does not reasonably establish the identity of the person presenting the documentary evidence. For example, documentary evidence is not valid if it is provided in person by an individual and the photograph or signature on the documentary evidence does not match
the appearance or signature of the person presenting the document. A withholding agent may not treat documentary evidence as valid if the documentary evidence contains information that is inconsistent with the person's claim as to its chapter 4 status, the withholding agent has other account information that is inconsistent with the person's chapter 4 status, or the documentary evidence lacks information necessary to establish the person's chapter 4 status. Additionally, a withholding agent that is a financial institution under § 1.1471-5(e), or other entity as described in § 1.1441-7(b)(3) that has obtained documentary evidence to reliably associate a payment to a foreign person under paragraph (c) of this section has reason to know that the person's claim of foreign status is unreliable or incorrect only if there are U.S. indicia, as described in § 1.1441-7(b)(8), associated with the person and appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia has not been obtained in accordance with § 1.1441-7(b) within 90 days of when the U.S. indicia was first identified by the withholding agent. See also § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) for requirements when a change in circumstances occurs for purposes of chapter 3 and the related grace period allowed under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv).
(B)
Standards of knowledge applicable to certain types of documentary evidence
—(
1
)
Financial statement.
A withholding agent that obtains a financial statement for purposes of establishing that a foreign payee meets a certain asset threshold has reason to know that the chapter 4 status claimed is unreliable or incorrect only if the total assets shown on the financial statement for the payee, and if relevant the payee's expanded affiliated group, are not within the permissible thresholds, or the footnotes to the financial statement indicate that the payee is not a foreign entity or is not a type of FFI eligible for the chapter 4 status claimed. A withholding agent that obtains a financial statement for purposes of establishing that the payee is an active NFFE will be required to review the balance sheet and income statement to determine whether the payee meets the income and asset thresholds set forth in § 1.1472-1(c)(1)(iv) and the footnotes of the financial statement for an indication that the payee is not a foreign entity or is a financial institution. A withholding agent that obtains a financial statement for purposes of establishing a chapter 4 status for a payee that does not require the payee to meet an asset or income threshold will be required to review only the footnotes to the financial statement to determine whether the financial statement supports the claim of chapter 4 status. A withholding agent that is not relying upon a financial statement to establish the chapter 4 status of the payee (for example because it has other documentation that establishes the payee's chapter 4 status) is not required to independently evaluate the financial statement solely because the withholding agent also has collected the financial statement in the course of its account opening or other procedures.
(
2
)
Organizational documents.
A withholding agent that obtains organizational documents for a payee solely for the purpose of supporting the chapter 4 status claimed by the entity will only be required to review the document sufficiently to establish that the entity is a foreign person and that the purposes for which the entity was formed and its basic activities appear to be of a type consistent with the chapter 4 status claimed, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (d) of this section. A withholding agent that obtains organizational documents for the purpose of establishing that an entity has a particular chapter 4 status will only be required to review the document to the extent needed to establish that the entity is a foreign person, that the requirements applicable to the particular chapter 4 status are met, and that the document was executed, but will not be required to review the remainder of the document.
(v)
Specific standards of knowledge applicable when only documentary evidence is a code or classification described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
A withholding agent may not rely upon a classification described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section or a standardized industry coding system to treat an entity as having a foreign status if
there are U.S. indicia described in paragraph (e)(4)(v)(A) of this section associated with the entity, unless such U.S. indicia are cured in the manner set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B) of this section.
(A)
U.S. indicia for entities.
The term
U.S. indicia
when used with respect to an entity includes, for purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(v) any of the following—
(
1
) Classification of an account holder as a U.S. resident in the withholding agent's customer files;
(
2
) A current U.S. residence address or U.S. mailing address;
(
3
) With respect to an offshore obligation, standing instructions to pay amounts to a U.S. address or an account maintained in the United States;
(
4
) A current telephone number for the entity in the United States but no telephone number for the entity outside of the United States;
(
5
) A current telephone number for the entity in the United States in addition to a telephone number for the entity outside of the United States;
(
6
) A power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address; and
(
7
) An “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address provided for the entity.
(B)
Documentation required to cure U.S. indicia.
A withholding agent may rely upon a code or classification described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section to treat an entity as having a foreign chapter 4 status if there are U.S. indicia associated with the entity and the withholding agent obtains the relevant documentation described in this paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B).
(
1
) If there are U.S. indicia described in paragraphs (e)(4)(v)(A)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section associated with the entity, the withholding agent may treat the entity as a foreign person only if the withholding agent obtains a withholding certificate for the entity and one form of documentary evidence, described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, that establishes the entity's status as a foreign person (such as a certificate of incorporation).
(
2
) If there are U.S. indicia described in paragraphs (e)(4)(v)(A)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section associated with the entity and the withholding agent is making a payment with respect to an offshore obligation, the withholding agent may also treat the entity as a foreign person if the withholding agent obtains a withholding certificate for the entity and the withholding agent treats the entity as foreign for purposes of foreign tax reporting. A withholding agent will treat an entity as foreign for purposes of foreign tax reporting only if the withholding agent classifies the entity as a resident of the country in which the obligation is maintained, the withholding agent is required to report a payment made to the entity annually on a tax information statement that is filed with the tax authority of the country in which the account is maintained as part of that country's resident reporting requirements, and that country has a tax information exchange agreement or income tax treaty in effect with the United States.
(
3
) If there are indicia described in paragraphs (e)(4)(v)(A)(
5
) through (
7
) of this section associated with the entity, the withholding agent may treat the entity as a foreign person if the withholding agent obtains a withholding certificate or one form of documentary evidence, described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, that establishes the entity's status as a foreign person (such as a certificate of incorporation).
(vi)
Specific standards of knowledge applicable to documentation received from intermediaries and flow-through entities
—(A)
In general.
A withholding agent that receives documentation from a payee through an intermediary or flow-through entity is required to review all documentation obtained with respect to the payee and all intermediaries and/or flow-through entities in the chain of payment, applying the standards of knowledge set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This standard requires, but is not limited to, a withholding agent's compliance with the rules of paragraphs (e)(4)(vi)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section.
(
1
) The withholding agent is required to review the withholding statement or owner reporting statement provided and may not rely on information in the statement to the extent the information does not support the claims made regarding the chapter 4 status of the
person. For this purpose, a withholding agent may not treat a person as a foreign person if an address in the United States is provided for such person unless the withholding statement is accompanied by a valid withholding certificate and documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section).
(
2
) The withholding agent must review each withholding certificate and written statement in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section and all documentary evidence in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(i) and (iv) of this section, and must verify that the information contained on the withholding certificate, written statement, and documentary evidence is consistent with the information on the withholding statement or owner reporting statement. If there is a discrepancy between the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence and the withholding statement or owner reporting statement, the withholding agent may choose to rely on the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence provided such documentation is valid and the intermediary or flow-through entity does not indicate that the documentation is unreliable or inaccurate, or may apply the presumption rules set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. If the withholding agent chooses to rely upon the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence, the withholding agent is required to instruct the intermediary or flow-through entity to correct the withholding statement and confirm that the intermediary or flow-through entity does not know or have reason to know that the documentation is unreliable or inaccurate.
(B)
Limits on reason to know with respect to documentation received from participating FFIs and registered deemed-compliant FFIs that are intermediaries or flow-through entities.
A withholding agent that receives documentation from a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is not the payee must apply the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(vi)(A) of this section, except that the withholding agent may rely upon the chapter 4 status provided by the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI in the withholding statement, including a chapter 4 status determined under the requirements of (and documentation or information that is publicly available that determines the chapter 4 status of the payee permitted under) an applicable IGA for an account holder, provided that the withholding agent has the information necessary to report on Form 1042-S, unless the withholding agent has information that conflicts with the chapter 4 status provided. See § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
)(
iv
) (requiring that a nonqualified intermediary withholding statement for a reportable amount that is a withholdable payment include the recipient code for chapter 4 purposes used for filing Form 1042-S for an entity payee). If underlying documentation is provided for the payee and information in the documentation or in the withholding agent's records conflicts with the chapter 4 status claimed by the payee, the withholding agent has reason to know that the chapter 4 status claimed is unreliable or incorrect. A withholding agent is not, however, required to verify information contained in documentation provided by an intermediary or flow-through entity that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is not facially incorrect and is not required to obtain supporting documentation for the payee in addition to a withholding certificate unless the withholding agent obtains such documentation for purposes of chapter 3 or 61 or unless the withholding agent knows that the review conducted by the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI for purposes of chapter 4 was not adequate. For example, a withholding agent that receives a withholding statement from a participating FFI that is an intermediary stating that the payee is a registered deemed-compliant FFI is only required to determine that any withholding certificate provided for the payee contains a GIIN and that the GIIN does not appear to be facially invalid (for example, because it does not contain the correct amount of digits), but is not subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Similarly, a withholding agent that receives from a
participating FFI that is a partnership a withholding statement claiming that the payee is an active NFFE has reason to know that the claim is unreliable or incorrect if it receives a withholding statement that contains a U.S. address for the payee unless the partnership also provides a copy of documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia in the manner set forth in this paragraph (e) or the withholding statement indicates that appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia in the manner set forth in this paragraph (e) has been obtained and provides details of such documentation, such as the type of documentation and an identification number of the person contained in the document.
(vii)
Limits on reason to know
—(A)
Scope of review for preexisting obligations of entities.
For purposes of determining whether a withholding agent that makes a payment with respect to a preexisting obligation to an entity has reason to know that the chapter 4 status applied to the entity is unreliable or incorrect, the withholding agent is only required to review information contradicting the chapter 4 status claimed if such information is contained in the current customer master file, the most recent withholding certificate, written statement, and documentary evidence for the person, the most recent account opening contract, the most recent documentation obtained by the withholding agent for purposes of AML due diligence or for other regulatory purposes, any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect, and any standing instructions to pay amounts that is currently in effect.
(B)
Reason to know there are U.S. indicia associated with preexisting obligations.
With respect to a preexisting obligation, a withholding agent may apply the limits on reason to know described in § 1.1441-7(b)(3)(ii) for a person that the withholding agent has previously documented for purposes of chapter 3 or 61. A withholding agent that applies the limits on reason to know described in § 1.1441-7(b)(3)(ii) must, however, review for U.S. indicia any additional documentation upon which the withholding agent is relying to determine the chapter 4 status of the person, if any.
(C)
Reason to know there are U.S. indicia associated with preexisting offshore obligations.
For payments made outside of the United States with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation and with respect to a withholding agent that had not already documented the payee for purposes of chapter 3 or 61, the withholding agent, in lieu of searching the account files addressed in paragraph (e)(4)(vii)(A) of this section to determine whether there are U.S. indicia associated with the payee (or other person who receives the payment), may instead rely upon a search of its electronically searchable information associated with such person. A withholding agent that relies upon an electronic search pursuant to this paragraph (e)(4)(vii)(C) must also review for U.S. indicia any documentation upon which the withholding agent relies to determine the chapter 4 status of the person and any documentation that the withholding agent had been relying upon to determine the residency or citizenship of the person.
(D)
Limits on reason to know for multiple obligations belonging to a single person.
A withholding agent that maintains multiple obligations for a single person will have reason to know that a chapter 4 status assigned to the person is inaccurate based on information contained in the customer files for another obligation held by the person only to the extent that—
(
1
) The withholding agent's computerized systems link the obligations by reference to a data element such as client number, EIN, or foreign tax identifying number and consolidates the customer information and payment information for the obligations; or
(
2
) The withholding agent has treated the obligations as consolidated obligations for purposes of sharing documentation pursuant to paragraph (c)(8) of this section or for purposes of treating one or more accounts as preexisting obligations.
(viii)
Reasonable explanation supporting claim of foreign status.
A reasonable explanation supporting a claim of foreign status for an individual has the meaning described in § 1.1441-7(b)(12).
(5)
Conduit financing arrangements.
The rules set forth in § 1.1441-7(f), regarding a withholding agent's liability for failing to withhold in the case in which the financing arrangement is a conduit financing arrangement, apply for purposes determining a withholding agent's liability for any withholding required under chapter 4.
(6)
Additional guidance.
The IRS may prescribe other circumstances for which a withholding certificate or documentary evidence to establish a payee's chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect in addition to the circumstances described in this paragraph (e).
(f)
Presumptions regarding chapter 4 status of the person receiving the payment in the absence of documentation
—(1)
In general.
A withholding agent that cannot, prior to the payment, reliably associate (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) the payment with valid documentation may rely on the presumptions of this paragraph (f) to determine the status of the payee (or other person receiving the payment) as a U.S. or foreign person and such person's other relevant characteristics (for example, as a nonparticipating FFI). Paragraph (f)(2) of this section provides the presumption rules with respect to classification as an individual or entity. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section provides the presumption rules to determine a payee's U.S. or foreign status. Paragraph (f)(4) of this section provides the presumption rules with respect to an entity's chapter 4 status. Paragraph (f)(5) of this section provides the presumption rules with respect to an intermediary or flow-through entity. Paragraph (f)(6) of this section provides the presumption rules with respect to effectively connected income paid to a U.S. branch of a payee. Paragraph (f)(7) of this section provides the presumption rules that apply to a payment made to joint payees. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section provides rules for how a payee may rebut the presumptions described in this paragraph (f). Paragraph (f)(9) of this section provides the consequences to a withholding agent that fails to withhold in accordance with the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (f) or that has actual knowledge or reason to know facts that are contrary to the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (f).
(2)
Presumptions of classification as an individual or entity and entity as the beneficial owner.
A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with a valid withholding certificate, or that has received valid documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), but cannot determine a payee's status as an individual or an entity from the documentary evidence, must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) to determine the payee's classification as an individual, trust, partnership, corporation, intermediary, or flow-through entity. Additionally, a withholding agent that receives valid documentary evidence with respect to an entity must apply the rules under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) to determine when it may treat such entity as a beneficial owner.
(3)
Presumptions of U.S. or foreign status.
If a withholding agent cannot reliably associate a payment with a valid withholding certificate or valid documentary evidence from which it is possible to determine the payee's U.S. or foreign status, it must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) to determine the U.S. or foreign status of the payee (substituting the term
withholdable payment
for the term
payment
). In the case of a payment that a withholding agent can reliably associate with valid documentation that indicates the payment is made to a U.S. person but does not indicate whether the person is a specified U.S. person, the payment will be presumed made to a specified U.S. person unless the withholding agent can apply the presumption rules of § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), (D), (E), (I), (J), (K), (L), or (N), to presume that the person is other than a specified U.S. person, or the person's name reasonably indicates that the person is a bank (for example because it contains the word Bank or a foreign equivalent).
(4)
Presumption of chapter 4 status for a foreign entity.
If a withholding agent cannot reliably associate a valid withholding certificate or valid documentary evidence sufficient to determine the chapter 4 status of the entity receiving payment under paragraph (d) of
this section (for example, as a participating FFI, nonparticipating FFI, or NFFE), it must presume that the entity is a nonparticipating FFI.
(5)
Presumption of chapter 4 status of payee with respect to a payment to an intermediary or flow-through entity.
If a withholding agent makes a payment to a foreign flow-through entity or intermediary, including a payment that it is required to treat as made to such an entity under paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, and cannot reliably associate such payment with valid documentation under paragraph (c) of this section, the withholding agent must presume that the payment is made to a nonparticipating FFI.
(6)
Presumption of effectively connected income for payments to certain U.S. branches.
A withholding agent that makes a payment to a U.S. branch described in this paragraph (f)(6) may presume, in the absence of documentation indicating otherwise, that the U.S. branch is the payee of a payment that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States if the withholding agent has obtained an EIN from the U.S. branch (either orally or in writing). A U.S. branch is described in this paragraph (f)(6) if it is a U.S. branch of a foreign bank subject to regulatory supervision by the Federal Reserve Board or a U.S. branch of a foreign insurance company required to file an annual statement on a form approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners with the Insurance Department of a State, a Territory, or the District of Columbia. A payment is treated as made to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or foreign insurance company if the payment is credited to an account maintained in the United States in the name of a U.S. branch of the foreign person, or the payment is made to an address in the United States where the U.S. branch is located and the name of the U.S. branch appears on documents (in written or electronic form) associated with the payment (for example, the check mailed or letter addressed to the branch).
(7)
Joint payees
—(i)
In general.
If a withholding agent makes a payment to joint payees and cannot reliably associate the payment with valid documentation from each payee but all of the joint payees appear to be individuals, then the payment is presumed made to an unidentified U.S. person. If any joint payee does not appear, by its name and other information contained in the account file, to be an individual, then the entire payment will be treated as made to a nonparticipating FFI. However, if one of the joint payees provides a Form W-9 in accordance with the procedures described in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, the payment shall be treated as made to that payee.
(ii)
Exception for offshore obligations.
If a withholding agent makes a payment outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation held by joint payees and cannot reliably associate a payment with valid documentation from each payee but all of the joint payees appear to be individuals, then the payment is presumed made to an unknown foreign individual if the payment with respect to the offshore obligation is made outside the United States (as described in § 1.6049-5(e)).
(8)
Rebuttal of presumptions.
A payee may rebut the presumptions described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (7) of this section by providing reliable documentation to the withholding agent or, if applicable, to the IRS.
(9)
Effect of reliance on presumptions and of actual knowledge or reason to know otherwise
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(9), a withholding agent that withholds on a payment under section 1471 or 1472 in accordance with the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (f) shall not be liable for withholding under this section even if it is later established that the payee has a chapter 4 status other than the status presumed. A withholding agent that fails to report and withhold in accordance with the presumptions described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (7) of this section with respect to a payment that it cannot reliably associate with valid documentation shall be liable for tax, interest, and penalties. See § 1.1474-1(a) for the extent of a withholding agent's liability for failing to withhold in accordance with the presumptions described in this paragraph (f).
(ii)
Actual knowledge or reason to know that amount of withholding is greater than is required under the presumptions or that reporting of the payment is required.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section, a withholding agent that knows or has reason to know that the status or characteristics of the person are other than what is presumed under this paragraph (f) may not rely on the presumptions described in this paragraph (f) to the extent that, if it determined the status of the person based on such knowledge or reason to know, it would be required to withhold (under this section or another withholding provision of the Code) an amount greater than would be the case if it relied on the presumptions described in this paragraph (f). In such a case, the withholding agent must rely on its knowledge or reason to know rather than on the presumptions set forth in this paragraph (f). Failure to do so shall result in liability for tax, interest, and penalties to the extent described in § 1.1474-1(a).
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on January 6, 2017. However, taxpayers may apply these provisions as of January 28, 2013. A taxpayer may apply paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section to all of its open tax years. (For the rules that apply beginning on January 28, 2013, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2016.)
[T.D. 9610, 78 FR 5916, Jan. 28, 2013; 78 FR 55204, Sept. 10, 2013, as amended by T.D. 9657, 79 FR 12830, Mar. 6, 2014; T.D. 9809, 82 FR 2152, Jan. 6, 2017; 82 FR 29729, June 30, 2017; T.D. 9890, 85 FR 204, Jan. 2, 2020]
§ 1.1471-4
FFI agreement.
(a)
In general.
An FFI agreement will be in effect in accordance with section 1471(b) if an FFI registers with the IRS pursuant to procedures prescribed by the IRS and agrees to comply with the terms of an FFI agreement. The FFI agreement will incorporate the requirements set forth in this section, any modifications set forth in an applicable Model 2 IGA, and any provisions applicable to a reporting Model 1 FFI.
(1)
Withholding.
A participating FFI is required to deduct and withhold tax with respect to payments made to recalcitrant account holders and nonparticipating FFIs to the extent required under paragraph (b) of this section. A participating FFI that is prohibited by foreign law from withholding as required under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an account must close such account within a reasonable period of time or must otherwise block or transfer such account as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Identification and documentation of account holders.
A participating FFI is required to obtain such information regarding each holder of each account maintained by the participating FFI to determine whether each account is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI in accordance with the due diligence procedures for identifying and documenting account holders described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Reporting.
A participating FFI is required to report the information described in paragraph (d) of this section annually with respect to U.S. accounts under section 1471(c) and accounts held by recalcitrant account holders. A participating FFI must also comply with the filing requirements described in § 1.1474-1(c) and (d) to report payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts paid to recalcitrant account holders and nonparticipating FFIs (including the transitional reporting of foreign reportable amounts paid to nonparticipating FFIs for calendar years 2015 and 2016 described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F)). A participating FFI that is unable to obtain a waiver, if required by foreign law, to report an account as required under paragraph (d) of this section must close or transfer such account within a reasonable period of time as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(4)
Expanded affiliated group.
Except as otherwise provided in Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA, in order for any FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group to be a participating FFI, each FFI that is a member of the expanded affiliated group must be a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
For a limited period described in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, however, a branch of an FFI or an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group and is unable under foreign law to satisfy the requirements of this section may instead obtain status as a limited branch of a participating FFI or limited FFI if the branch or FFI meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section (as applicable).
(5)
Verification.
A participating FFI is required to adopt a compliance program as described in paragraph (f) of this section under the authority of the responsible officer, who will be required to certify periodically to the IRS on behalf of the FFI regarding the participating FFI's compliance with the requirements of the FFI agreement. If the IRS identifies concerns about the participating FFI's compliance, the IRS may request additional information to verify compliance with the requirements of the FFI agreement as described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(6)
Event of default.
A participating FFI is required to cure an event of default with respect to the FFI agreement as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the IRS will deliver to a participating FFI a notice of default and will allow the FFI an opportunity to cure the event of default as described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(7)
Refunds.
A participating FFI may file a collective refund on behalf of certain account holders and payees for amounts withheld by the participating FFI or its withholding agent under chapter 4 in excess of the account holder or payee's U.S. tax liability to the extent permitted in paragraph (h) of this section. A participating FFI may also make an adjustment for overwithholding using either the reimbursement procedure described in § 1.1474-2(a)(3) or the set-off procedure described in § 1.1474-2(a)(4).
(b)
Withholding requirements
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in a Model 2 IGA, a participating FFI is required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 30 percent of any withholdable payment made by such participating FFI to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or to a nonparticipating FFI after June 30, 2014, to the extent required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for rules for a participating FFI to identify the payee of a payment in order to determine whether withholding is required under this paragraph (b). See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the extent of a participating FFI's requirement to deduct and withhold tax on a foreign passthru payment made by such participating FFI to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or to a nonparticipating FFI. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the rules for withholding on payments to limited branches and limited FFIs. See paragraph (b)(6) for the special allowance to set aside in escrow amounts withheld with respect to dormant accounts. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for the withholding requirements of certain U.S. branches of FFIs. See § 1.1471-2 for the exceptions to and special rules for withholding and the exclusion from the definitions of the terms
withholdable payment
and
foreign passthru payment
that applies to any payment made under a grandfathered obligation or the gross proceeds from the disposition of such an obligation. See § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii) for the requirement of participating FFIs to report payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts. See § 1.1474-6 for the coordination of withholding on payments under this paragraph (b) with the other withholding provisions under the Code.
(2)
Withholding determination.
Except as otherwise provided under § 1.1471-2 and, with respect to certain preexisting accounts, under paragraph (c) of this section, a participating FFI is required to determine whether withholding applies at the time a payment is made by reliably associating the payment with valid documentation described in paragraph (c) of this section for the payee of the payment. For a payment made to an account, if the account is held by one or more individuals, the payee is each individual account holder. For a payment made to an account held by an entity, except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-3(a)(3), the payee is the account holder. If the participating FFI makes a withholdable payment to a
payee that is an entity and the payment is made with respect to an obligation that is not an account, except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-3(a)(3), the payee is the person to whom the payment is made. See § 1.1473-1(a) to determine when a payment is made in the case of a withholdable payment. If a participating FFI cannot reliably associate a payment (or any portion of a payment) with valid documentation, the rules described in paragraph (c) of this section shall apply to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder (and payee if other than the account holder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating FFI may establish after the date of payment that withholding was not required to the extent permitted under § 1.1471-3(c)(7) or may apply the procedures provided in § 1.1474-2 when overwithholding occurs.
(3)
Satisfaction of withholding requirements
—(i)
In general.
A participating FFI that complies with the withholding obligations of this paragraph (b) with respect to accounts held by recalcitrant account holders and payees that are nonparticipating FFIs shall be deemed to satisfy its withholding obligations under sections 1471(a) and 1472 with respect to such account holders and payees.
(ii)
Withholding not required.
A participating FFI that is an NQI, NWP, NWT, or that is a QI that elects under section 1471(b)(3) not to assume withholding responsibility for a payment and that provides its withholding agent with the information necessary to allocate all or a portion of the payment to each payee as part of a withholding certificate described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii) will generally not be required to withhold under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. See § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii), however, for the circumstances under which a participating FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT has a residual withholding responsibility. See also § 1.1471-3(c)(9)(iii)(B) for the circumstances under which a participating FFI that is a broker has a residual withholding responsibility as an intermediary of the payment and may also be liable for any underwithholding that occurs. See §§ 1.1471-2(a) and 1.1472-1(a)(2)(i) and the QI, WP, or WT agreement for the withholding requirements of a participating FFI that is a QI, WP, or WT for purposes of chapter 4.
(iii)
Election to withhold under section 3406.
A participating FFI may elect to satisfy its withholding obligation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to recalcitrant account holders that are also U.S. non-exempt recipients subject to backup withholding under section 3406 receiving withholdable payments, to the extent that the payments also constitute reportable payments, by applying withholding under section 3406 at the backup withholding rate to such withholdable payments. A participating FFI may make the election described in this paragraph only if it complies with the information reporting rules under chapter 61 with respect to payments to which backup withholding applies. Nothing in this paragraph relieves a participating FFI of its requirement to backup withhold under section 3406 with respect to reportable payments that are not also withholdable payments. See § 1.1474-6(f) for the general rule that satisfying withholding requirements under chapter 4 will satisfy backup withholding requirements under section 3406 for a payment that is both a withholdable payment and a reportable payment.
(4)
Foreign passthru payments.
A participating FFI is not required to deduct and withhold tax on a foreign passthru payment made by such participating FFI to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or to a nonparticipating FFI before the later of January 1, 2019, or the date of publication in the
Federal Register
of final regulations defining the term

Withholding on limited FFIs and limited branches
—(i)
Limited FFIs.
A participating FFI is required to withhold on a withholdable payment made to a limited FFI identifying itself as a nonparticipating FFI. A participating FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more limited FFIs will also be required to treat any such limited FFI as a nonparticipating FFI with respect to withholdable payments made to such limited FFI. A participating FFI will be considered to have made a
withholdable payment to a limited FFI if such participating FFI receives a withholdable payment with respect to a security or instrument held on behalf of a limited FFI (or an account maintained by the limited FFI). A participating FFI will also be considered to have made a withholdable payment to a limited FFI when the limited FFI receives a payment with respect to a transaction between the limited FFI and such participating FFI that is in the same expanded affiliated group and such transaction hedges or otherwise provides total return exposure to another transaction between such participating FFI and a third party that gives rise to a withholdable payment.
(ii)
Limited branches.
A participating FFI is required to withhold on a withholdable payment made to a limited branch identifying itself as a nonparticipating FFI. A branch of the participating FFI other than the limited branch is also required to withhold on a withholdable payment when it receives the payment on behalf of a limited branch of the participating FFI. A branch of the participating FFI other than a limited branch will be considered to have received a withholdable payment on behalf of a limited branch when such other branch receives a withholdable payment with respect to a security or instrument it holds on behalf of a limited branch (or an account maintained by the limited branch). A branch of a participating FFI other than a limited branch will be considered to hold a security or instrument on behalf of a limited branch when it executes a transaction with a limited branch that hedges or otherwise provides total return exposure to another transaction between such other branch and a third party that gives rise to a withholdable payment.
(6)
Special rule for dormant accounts.
A participating FFI that makes a withholdable payment not otherwise subject to withholding under chapter 3 or backup withholding under section 3406 to a recalcitrant account holder of a dormant account that it maintains must withhold on the account for purposes of chapter 4. However, the participating FFI may, in lieu of depositing the tax withheld, set aside the amount withheld in escrow until the date that the account ceases to be a dormant account. In such case, the tax withheld becomes due 90 days following the date that the account ceases to be a dormant account if the account holder does not provide the documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section or becomes refundable to the account holder if the account holder provides the documentation required under paragraph (c) of this section establishing that withholding does not apply. A participating FFI that maintains a dormant account of a recalcitrant account holder and that elects to escrow withheld tax pursuant to this paragraph (b)(6) may not delegate the responsibility to escrow withheld tax to the withholding agent from which it is receiving payment. Once a dormant account escheats irrevocably to a foreign government under the relevant laws in the jurisdiction in which the participating FFI (or branch thereof) operates, the participating FFI is no longer required to deposit with the IRS the amount held in escrow with respect to the account. See paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section for the definition of dormant account.
(7)
Withholding requirements for U.S. branches of FFIs treated as U.S. persons.
A U.S. branch of an FFI treated as a U.S. person must satisfy its backup withholding obligations under section 3406(a) with respect to accounts held at the U.S. branch by account holders that are payees treated as other than exempt recipients under chapter 61. See §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(C), 1.1471-2(a), and 1.1472-1(a) for additional withholding obligations for a U.S. branch of an FFI treated as a U.S. person. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for the reporting requirements applicable to U.S. branches of FFIs that are treated as U.S. persons.
(c) Due diligence for the identification and documentation of account holders and payees—(1)
Scope of paragraph.
Except to the extent that a participating FFI relies on the due diligence procedures set forth in an applicable Model 2 IGA, a participating FFI must follow this paragraph (c) to identify and document the chapter 4 status
of each holder of an account maintained by the participating FFI to determine if the account is a U.S. account, non-U.S. account, or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides the general rules for identification and documentation of account holders and payees, and paragraph (c)(2)(v) provides documentation requirements for certain U.S. branches of FFIs. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides the rules for documenting entity accounts and payees. Paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides the general rules for documenting individual accounts other than preexisting accounts. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section provides the identification and documentation procedure for preexisting individual accounts. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the documentation exceptions for entity accounts and individual accounts. Paragraph (c)(7) of this section outlines the certification requirement relating to the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) with respect to preexisting accounts within the specified periods of time.
(2)
General rules for the identification and documentation of account holders and payees
—(i)
Overview.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section (documentation exceptions for certain preexisting accounts), a participating FFI is required to identify among accounts maintained by the participating FFI each account that is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI, and to report information about such accounts in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section and § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). See § 1.1471-5(a)(3) for rules to determine the holder of an account. The participating FFI is also required to retain a record of the documentation collected or otherwise maintained that meets the requirements described in this paragraph (c) when making certain payments to an account holder or payee (if other than an account holder) to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section or whether reporting applies under § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii)(C) and any payee for which it provides the certification described in § 1.1471-3(c)(9)(iii)(A) to another withholding agent.
(ii)
Standards of knowledge
—(A)
In general.
A participating FFI may rely on valid documentation that is collected pursuant to the due diligence procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) or that is otherwise maintained in the participating FFI's files, unless the participating FFI knows or has reason to know that such documentation is unreliable or incorrect. For purposes of a participating FFI documenting an account holder under this paragraph (c), the requirements for the validity of withholding certificates, written statements, and documentary evidence provided in § 1.1471-3(c) shall apply regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. Except as otherwise provided paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (certain mergers or bulk acquisitions) and in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section (preexisting individual accounts), to determine whether a participating FFI knows or has reason to know that the documentation collected or otherwise maintained with respect to the account holder is unreliable or incorrect, the standards of knowledge provided in § 1.1471-3(e) shall apply regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. See § 1.1471-3(c)(8) and (9) for the requirement to obtain documentation on an account-by-account basis and the exceptions to this requirement.
(B)
Limits on reason to know with respect to certain accounts acquired in merger or bulk acquisition.
A participating FFI that acquires accounts of another financial institution either in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value (other than a related party transaction described in § 1.1471-3(c)(9)(v)) may apply the limitations on reason to know provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section (as applicable and subject to the conditions therein), or the rules of § 1.1471-3(c)(9)(v) to rely upon documentation collected by another financial institution for an account acquired either in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value.
(
1
)
In general.
The participating FFI may treat accounts acquired in a transaction described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) as preexisting accounts for purposes of applying the identification and documentation procedures of this paragraph (c) by substituting the date of acquisition of such accounts for the effective date of the FFI agreement.
(
2
)
Participating FFIs and certain deemed-compliant FFIs that apply the due diligence rules, and U.S. financial institutions.
If a participating FFI (transferee FFI) acquires accounts of another participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (including a U.S. branch of either such FFI) that applies the due diligence requirements of this paragraph (c) as a condition of its status (as described in § 1.1471-5(f)), or of a U.S. financial institution (transferor FI), the transferee FFI may rely on the chapter 4 status determination made by the transferor FI for an account holder and will not be subject to the standards of knowledge set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section until there is a change in circumstances with respect to the account if the following conditions are met—
(
i
) The transferee FFI does not have actual knowledge that the chapter 4 status determination provided by the transferor FI is unreliable or incorrect;
(
ii
) For the certification period following the acquisition of such accounts (described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section), the transferee FFI acquiring the accounts tests a sample of the acquired accounts to determine if the chapter 4 status determinations made by the transferor FI are reliable;
(
iii
) In the case of a transferor FI that is a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (or a U.S. branch of either such entity that is not treated as a U.S. person) or that is a deemed-compliant FFI that applies the requisite due diligence rules of this paragraph (c) as a condition of its status, the transferor FI provides a written representation to the transferee FFI acquiring the accounts that the transferor FI has applied the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) with respect to the transferred accounts and, in the case of a transferor FI that is a participating FFI, has complied with the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and
(
iv
) In the case of a transferor FI that is a U.S. financial institution or that is a U.S branch of a participating FFI or of a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is treated as a U.S. person, the transferee FFI may rely on the chapter 4 status determinations for a payee that is an entity only if prior to the date of transfer the U.S. financial institution or U.S. branch made a withholdable payment to the payee or, for a payee that is an individual, only if the U.S. financial institution or U.S. branch made a reportable payment (as defined under section 3406(b)) to the payee.
(iii)
Change in circumstances
—(A)
Obligation to identify a change in circumstances.
A participating FFI is required to institute procedures to ensure that any change in circumstances, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, is identified by the participating FFI, including procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances with respect to an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the account holder has a mailing address in the United States when there was no U.S. address previously associated with the account, the participating FFI will be required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and will be required to retain a record of the appropriate documentation from the account holder as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Definition of change in circumstances.
For purposes of this section, a change in circumstances (as defined in § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)) includes any change or addition of information to the account holder's account (including the addition, substitution, or other change of an account holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such account (applying the account aggregation rules described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) or by treating the accounts as consolidated obligations) if such change or addition of information affects the chapter 4 status of the account holder. For example, if a holder of an account (including a preexisting
account) opens another account that is linked to such account in the participating FFI's computerized system as described under § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) and as part of the participating FFI's account opening procedures the account holder provides a U.S. telephone number for such other account, this is a change in circumstances with respect to the first mentioned account. With respect to a preexisting account that meets a documentation exception described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section, a change in circumstances also includes a change in account balance or value as of the end of the first subsequent year that causes the account no longer to meet the documentation exception.
(C)
Requirements following a change in circumstances.
With respect to an individual account or an account held by a passive NFFE for which there is a change in circumstances with respect to the information regarding its owners, following a change in circumstances the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section within the time period provided by § 1.1471-5(g)(3)(iii) or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a recalcitrant account holder. With respect to an account held by an entity other than a passive NFFE described in the preceding sentence, following a change in circumstances, the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the date that is 90 days after the change in circumstances or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a nonparticipating FFI.
(iv)
Record retention.
A participating FFI must retain a record of the documentation collected (or otherwise maintained) to establish the chapter 4 status of an account holder or payee pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). A participating FFI will be treated as having retained a record of a withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence if the participating FFI retains either an original, certified copy, or photocopy (including a microfiche, scan, or similar means of record retention) of the withholding certificate, written statement, or documentary evidence collected to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder for six calendar years following the year in which the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) were performed for the account. With respect to documentary evidence for an offshore obligation, however, a participating FFI that is not required to retain copies of documentation reviewed pursuant to its AML due diligence will be treated as having retained a record of such documentation if the participating FFI retains a record in its files noting the date the documentation was reviewed, each type of document, the document's identification number (if any) (for example, passport number), and whether any U.S. indicia were identified. The previous sentence applies with respect to an offshore obligation that is also a preexisting obligation, except, in such case, the requirement to record whether the documentation contained U.S. indicia does not apply. A participating FFI must also retain a record of any searches, including search results provided by third-party credit agencies as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, results from electronic searches, and requests made and responses to relationship manager inquiries for six calendar years following the year in which the due diligence procedures of this paragraph (c) were performed for the account. A participating FFI may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such extension prior to the end of the six year retention period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, a participating FFI must retain a record of the chapter 4 status of an account holder or payee for as long as the FFI maintains the account or obligation. See § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(iii)(A) for the record retention period applicable to a participating FFI that is a withholding agent with respect to documentation collected (or otherwise maintained) for a payee.
(v)
Documentation rules for U.S. branches of FFIs that are treated as U.S. persons.
A U.S. branch of an FFI that is treated as a U.S. person shall apply the due diligence requirements of § 1.1471-3
to determine the chapter 4 status of account holders and payees that are entities and shall apply the documentation requirements of chapter 3 or 61 (as applicable) with respect to individual account holders. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for withholding rules and paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for reporting rules applicable to such U.S. branches.
(3)
Identification and documentation procedure for entity accounts and payees
—(i)
In general.
With respect to accounts held by entities, unless the documentation exception described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section applies, a participating FFI must determine if the account is a U.S. account or an account held by a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI by applying the principles of § 1.1471-3(b), (c), and (d) to establish the chapter 4 status of each account holder and each payee regardless of whether the participating FFI makes a payment to the account. If an account holder receiving a payment is not the payee of the payment under §§ 1.1471-3(a) and 1.1472-1(d)(3), the participating FFI is also required to establish the chapter 4 status of the payee or payees in order to determine whether withholding applies under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
Timeframe for applying identification and documentation procedure for entity accounts and payees.
For preexisting entity accounts (including entity accounts that are opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, that the FFI treats as preexisting obligations under § 1.1471-1(b)(104)(i)), a participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures within six months of the effective date of the FFI agreement for any account holder that is a prima facie FFI, as defined in § 1.1471-2(a)(4)(ii)(B), and within two years of the effective date of the FFI agreement for all other entity accounts, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. For accounts that are not preexisting accounts, the participating FFI must perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures by the earlier of the date a withholdable payment or a foreign passthru payment is made with respect to the account or within 90 days of the date the participating FFI opens the account. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), with respect to a preexisting obligation issued in nonregistered (bearer) form by an investment entity, the investment entity is required to perform the requisite identification and documentation procedures at the time a payment is collected by the beneficial owner of the payment (including a beneficial owner that collects the payment through an intermediary or agent). If the participating FFI cannot obtain all the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d) or if the participating FFI knows or has reason to know that the documentation provided for an entity account is unreliable or incorrect (by applying the standards of knowledge applicable to entities in § 1.1471-3(e) as modified by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)), the participating FFI shall apply the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) (as applicable to entities) to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder. In the case of an account held by a passive NFFE that provides the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(12) to establish its status as a passive NFFE but fails to provide the information regarding its owners, see § 1.1471-5(g)(2)(iv) for the requirement to treat the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder.
(iii)
Documentation exception for certain preexisting entity accounts
—(A)
Accounts to which this exception applies.
Unless the participating FFI elects otherwise pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, a participating FFI is not required to perform the identification and documentation procedure contained in this paragraph (c)(3) with respect to a preexisting entity account the aggregate balance or value of which is $250,000 or less if no holder of such account that has previously been documented by the FFI as a U.S. person for purposes of chapter 3 or 61 is a specified U.S. person. For purposes of applying this exception, the account balance must be determined as of the effective date of the FFI agreement and the aggregation rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section shall apply. An account that meets this
exception will cease to meet this exception as of the end of any subsequent calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000, applying the aggregation rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, or as of the date on which there is another change in circumstances with respect to the account or any account aggregated with the account. The exception to the identification and documentation procedure described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) does not apply to an entity account opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, that the FFI treats as a preexisting account under § 1.1471-1(b)(104)(i).
(B)
Aggregation of entity accounts.
For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of accounts held by an entity in applying the exception in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), an FFI is required to aggregate the balance or value of all accounts held (in whole or in part) by the same account holder to the extent required under § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii)(A) and (B).
(C)
Election to forgo exception.
A participating FFI may elect to forgo the exception described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) by applying the identification and documentation procedures provided in this paragraph (c)(3) within the time period provided by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section or otherwise applying the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) to determine the chapter 4 status of the account holder.
(4)
Identification and documentation procedure for individual accounts other than preexisting accounts
—(i)
In general.
With respect to an individual account that is not a preexisting account or an account described under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section or § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) (providing an exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less), a participating FFI must determine if the account is a U.S. account or non-U.S. account by retaining a record of certain documentation to establish the chapter 4 status of each account holder. Specifically, a participating FFI must retain a record of documentary evidence that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(c)(5) (as applicable to individuals), the information described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, or a withholding certificate to establish an account holder's status as a foreign person. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the participating FFI must also review all information collected in connection with the opening or maintenance of each account, including documentation collected as part of the participating FFI's account opening procedures and documentation collected for other regulatory purposes, and apply the standards of knowledge in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to determine if an account holder's claim of foreign status is unreliable or incorrect. If the participating FFI is not able to establish an account holder's status as a foreign person, the participating FFI must retain a record of either a Form W-9 or U.S. TIN (in any manner) and a valid and effective waiver described in section 1471(b)(1)(F)(i), if necessary, to establish an account holder's status as a U.S. person and to confirm that the account is a U.S. account. A participating FFI must complete the requisite identification and documentation procedures with respect to each account within the time period provided by § 1.1471-5(g)(3)(ii), or, if unable to do so, it must treat such account as held by a recalcitrant account holder. The presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) do not apply to individual account holders of a participating FFI.
(ii)
Reliance on third party for identification of individual accounts other than preexisting accounts.
A participating FFI may establish an account holder's status as a foreign person based on information provided by a third-party credit agency only if the following conditions are met—
(A) As part of the participating FFI's account opening procedures, the account holder provides a residence address outside the United States and attests in writing that the account holder is not a U.S. citizen or resident;
(B) The third-party credit agency verifies the account holder's claimed residence with at least one government data source from the jurisdiction in which the participating FFI (or branch thereof) operates or the account holder claims residence; and
(C) The participating FFI (or branch thereof) relies on the information provided by the third-party credit agency for purposes of satisfying AML due diligence with respect to the account in a FATF-compliant jurisdiction.
(iii)
Alternative identification and documentation procedure for certain cash value insurance or annuity contracts
—(A)
Group cash value insurance contracts or group annuity contracts.
A participating FFI may treat an account that is a group cash value insurance contract or group annuity contract and that meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) as a non-U.S. account until the date on which an amount is payable to an employee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the participating FFI obtains a certification from an employer that no employee/certificate holder (account holder) is a U.S. person. A participating FFI is also not required to review all the account information collected by the FFI to determine if an account holder's claim of foreign status is unreliable or incorrect. An account that is a group cash value insurance contract or group annuity contract meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) if—
(
1
) The group life insurance contract or a group annuity contract issued to an employer and covers twenty-five or more employee/certificate holders;
(
2
) The employee/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the employee's death; and
(
3
) The aggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does not exceed $1,000,000.
(B)
Accounts held by beneficiaries of a cash value insurance contract that is a life insurance contract.
A participating FFI may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a cash value insurance contract that is a life insurance contract (account holder) receiving a death benefit is a foreign person and treat such account as a non-U.S. account unless the participating FFI has actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficiary is a U.S. person. A participating FFI has reason to know that a beneficiary of a cash value insurance contract is a U.S. person if the information collected by the participating FFI and associated with the beneficiary contains U.S. indicia as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section. If a participating FFI has actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficiary is a U.S. person, the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(5)
Identification and documentation procedure for preexisting individual accounts
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a preexisting individual account, unless the account is an account described in § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) (providing exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less), a participating FFI may follow the identification and documentation procedures described below in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section (as applicable), in lieu of the identification and documentation procedures described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to determine if an account that is a preexisting account is a U.S. account, non-U.S. account, or account held by a recalcitrant account holder. A participating FFI must first determine whether there are any U.S. indicia associated with the account (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section), and second, if there are U.S. indicia associated with the account, retain a record of the documentation described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section to establish the account holder's chapter 4 status. For this purpose, the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) do not apply. A participating FFI must complete the requisite identification and documentation procedures with respect to each account within the time period provided by § 1.1471-5(g)(3)(i) or (ii) (as applicable) or, if unable to do so, must treat such account as held by a recalcitrant account holder. A participating FFI may continue to treat an account with no U.S. indicia or an account that meets a documentation exception described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section or § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) (providing exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less) as a non-U.S. account, until there is a
change in circumstances with respect to the account as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule for preexisting individual accounts previously documented as U.S. accounts for purposes of chapter 3 or 61.
If a participating FFI has documented an individual account holder as a U.S. person for purposes of chapter 3 or 61 and such account holder is a specified U.S. person, the account holder's account will be treated as a U.S. account for chapter 4 purposes and the identification and documentation procedures in paragraph (c)(5)(i) and (iv) of this section will not apply.
(iii)
Exceptions for certain low value preexisting individual accounts
—(A)
Accounts to which an exception applies.
Unless the participating FFI elects otherwise pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, a participating FFI is not required to perform requisite identification and documentation procedures described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) and (iv) of this section with respect to either a preexisting individual account, other than a cash value insurance or annuity contract, the aggregate balance or value of which is $50,000 or less, or a preexisting individual account that is a cash value insurance or annuity contract described in § 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iv) the aggregate balance or value of which is $250,000 or less. For purposes of applying these exceptions, the account balance must be determined as of the effective date of the FFI agreement and the aggregation rules of paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section shall apply. An account that meets either of these exceptions will cease to meet these exceptions as of the end of any subsequent calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000, applying the aggregation rules of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, or until there is another change in circumstances with respect to the account or any account aggregated with the account.
(B)
Aggregation of accounts.
For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of a preexisting individual account, other than an account that is cash value insurance or annuity contract, an FFI is required to aggregate the balance or value of all accounts that are not cash value insurance or annuity contracts to the extent required under § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii)(A) or (B). For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of preexisting individual account that is a cash value insurance or annuity contract, an FFI will be required to aggregate the balance or value of all accounts that are cash value insurance or annuity contracts to the extent required under § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii)(A) or (B).
(C)
Election to forgo exception.
A participating FFI may elect to forgo the exceptions described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section by applying the identification and documentation procedures provided in this paragraph (c) within the time provided by paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section or otherwise treating the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder pursuant to § 1.1471-5(g).
(iv)
Specific identification and documentation procedures for preexisting individual accounts
—(A)
In general.
A participating FFI applying the identification and documentation procedures of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv) must review its preexisting individual accounts (applying the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section and, if appropriate, the enhanced review for high-value accounts described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D) of this section) to determine if there are any U.S. indicia (as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section) associated with the account. If no U.S. indicia are identified with respect to an account, the participating FFI may treat the account as a non-U.S. account. If U.S. indicia are identified with respect to an account, the participating FFI must retain a record of the appropriate documentation described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person. A participating FFI that follows the procedures described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iv) (as applicable) with respect to its preexisting individual accounts will not be treated as having reason to know that the determination made with respect to the account was unreliable or incorrect because of information contained in any account files that the participating
FFI did not review and was not required to review under the applicable identification procedure. Thus, for example, if a participating FFI was only required to perform an electronic search with respect to a preexisting individual account and no U.S. indicia were identified in the results of the electronic search, the participating FFI would not have reason to know that the individual account holder was a U.S. person, even if the participating FFI had on file (but was not required to and did not review) a copy of the individual's passport that indicates that the individual was born in the United States.
(B)
U.S. indicia and relevant documentation rules
—(
1
)
U.S. indicia.
A participating FFI must review an account holder's account information to the extent required under paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(C) and (D) of this section for any of the following U.S. indicia:
(
i
) Designation of the account holder as a U.S. citizen or resident;
(
ii
) A U.S. place of birth;
(
iii
) A current U.S. residence address or U.S. mailing address (including a U.S. post office box);
(
iv
) A current U.S. telephone number (regardless of whether such number is the only telephone number associated with the account holder);
(
v
) Standing instructions to pay amounts from the account to an account maintained in the United States;
(
vi
) A current power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address; or

(
2
)
Documentation to be retained upon identifying U.S. indicia.
If U.S. indicia are identified with respect to an account holder's account information, a participating FFI must retain a record of the documentation described in paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
)(
i
) through (
vii
) of this section, applicable to the U.S. indicia identified, to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person. If the participating FFI cannot establish an account holder's status as a foreign person based on such documentation, the participating FFI must retain a record of a Form W-9 and a valid and effective waiver as described in section 1471(b)(1)(F)(ii), if necessary, to confirm that the account is a U.S. account or, if unable to do so, must treat the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder.
(
i
)
Designation of account holder as a U.S. citizen or resident.
If the information required to be reviewed with respect to the account contains a designation of an account holder as a U.S. citizen or resident, the participating FFI must retain a record of a withholding certificate and documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
ii
)
Unambiguous indication of a U.S. place of birth.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account unambiguously indicates a U.S. place of birth for an account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States and a copy of the individual's Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, or, alternatively, a withholding certificate, a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States, and a reasonable written explanation of the account holder's renunciation of U.S. citizenship or the reason the account holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
iii
)
U.S. address or U.S. mailing address.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account contains a U.S. address or a U.S. mailing address for an account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of a withholding certificate and a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
iv
)
Only U.S. telephone numbers.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account contains one or more telephone numbers in the United States and no other telephone numbers
for an account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of a withholding certificate and a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
v
)
U.S. telephone numbers and non-U.S. telephone numbers.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account contains one or more telephone numbers in the United States and at least one telephone number outside the United States for an account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of a withholding certificate or a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
vi
)
Standing instructions to pay amounts.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account contains standing instructions to pay amounts from the account to an account maintained in the United States for an account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of a withholding certificate and either a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) or a written reasonable explanation (as defined in § 1.1441-7(b)(12)) establishing the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(
vii
)
Power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address or “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address.
If information required to be reviewed with respect to the account includes a power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address or contains an “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address identified for the account holder, the participating FFI must retain a record of either a withholding certificate or a form of documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) in order to establish the account holder's status as a foreign person.
(C)
Electronic search for identifying U.S. indicia.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D) of this section relating to the enhanced review for high-value accounts, a participating FFI may rely solely on a review of the electronically searchable information associated with an account and maintained by the participating FFI to determine if there are any of the U.S. indicia described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section associated with the account. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C), however, an FFI will not be required to treat as U.S. indicia an in-care-of address or a hold mail address that is the sole address identified for the account holder.
(D)
Enhanced review for identifying U.S. indicia in the case of certain high-value accounts
—(
1
)
In general.
With respect to preexisting individual accounts that have a balance or value that exceeds $1,000,000 as of the effective date of the FFI agreement, or at the end of any subsequent calendar year (“high-value accounts”), a participating FFI must apply the enhanced review described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D) in addition to the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section to identify any U.S. indicia described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section associated with the account. For purposes of determining the balance or value of an account, a participating FFI must apply the aggregation rules § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii)(A) and (B). If a participating FFI applied the enhanced review described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D) to an account in a previous year, the participating FFI will not be required to reapply such procedures to such account in a subsequent year.
(
2
)
Relationship manager inquiry.
With respect to all high-value accounts, a participating FFI must identify accounts to which a relationship manager is assigned (including any accounts aggregated with such account) and for which the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the account holder is a U.S. citizen or resident.
(
3
)
Additional review of non-electronic records.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(E) of this section, and except with respect to any account for which the participating FFI has retained a record of a withholding certificate and documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5) establishing the account holder's foreign status, a
participating FFI must review to identify any U.S. indicia the current customer master file of a high-value account and, if not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents described in paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
3
)(
i
) through (
v
) of this section that are associated with such an account and were obtained by the participating FFI within the five calendar years preceding the later of the effective date of the FFI agreement, or the end of the calendar year in which the account exceeded the $1,000,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section. The documents to be reviewed by the participating FFI if not contained in the current customer master file are—
(
i
) The most recent withholding certificate, written statement, and documentary evidence;
(
ii
) The most recent account opening contract or documentation;
(
iii
) The most recent documentation obtained by the participating FFI for purposes of AML due diligence or for other regulatory purposes;
(
iv
) Any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and
(
v
) Any standing instructions to pay amounts to another account.
(
4
)
Limitations on the enhanced review in the case of comprehensive electronically searchable information.
A participating FFI is not required to apply the enhanced review of paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
3
) and may instead rely on the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section to identify U.S. indicia to the extent the following information is available in the FFI's electronically searchable information—
(
i
) The account holder's nationality and/or residence status;
(
ii
) The account holder's current residence address and mailing address;
(
iii
) The account holder's current telephone number(s);
(
iv
) Whether there are standing instructions to pay amounts to another account;
(
v
) Whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address for the account holder if no other residence or mailing address is found for the account; and
(
vi
) Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account.
(E)
Exception for preexisting individual accounts previously documented as held by foreign individuals.
A participating FFI that has previously obtained documentation from an account holder to establish the account holder's status as a foreign individual in order to meet its obligations under its QI, WP, or WT agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its reporting obligations as a U.S. payor under chapter 61, is not required to perform the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section or the enhanced review described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
3
) of this section for such account. Additionally, a participating FFI with a U.S. payor as its paying agent is not required to perform the electronic search described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section or the enhanced review described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
3
) of this section for an account for which its paying agent that is a U.S. payor has previously obtained documentation to establish the account holder's status as a foreign individual under chapter 61. The participating FFI is required, however, to perform the relationship manager inquiry described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
2
) of this section if the account is a high-value account described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(E), a participating FFI has documented an account holder's foreign status under chapter 61 if the participating FFI (or its paying agent that is a U.S. payor) has retained a record of the documentation required under chapter 61 to establish the foreign status of an individual and the account received a reportable payment as defined under section 3406(b) in any prior year that was properly reported in that year. In the case of a participating FFI that is a QI, WP, or WT, the participating FFI has documented an account holder's foreign status under its QI, WP, or WT agreement (as applicable) if the participating FFI has met the relevant documentation and reporting requirements of its agreement with respect to an account holder that received a reportable amount in any
year in which its agreement was in effect.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the documentation exceptions provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section:

# Example 1. Aggregation rules applicable to preexisting individual accounts.
U, a U.S. resident individual, holds 100 shares of common stock of FFI1, an investment entity. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, the common stock held by U is worth $45,000. U also holds shares of preferred stock of FFI1. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, U's preferred stock in FFI1 is worth $35,000. Neither FFI1's common stock nor FFI1's preferred stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. U also holds debt instruments issued by FFI1 that are not regularly traded on an established securities market. On the effective date of FFI1's FFI agreement, U's FFI1 debt instruments are worth $15,000. U's common and preferred equity interests are associated with U and with one another by reference to U's foreign tax identification number in FFI1's computerized information management system. However, U's debt instruments are not associated with U's equity interests in FFI1's computerized information management system. None of these accounts are managed by a relationship manager. Previously, FFI1 was not required to and did not obtain a Form W-9 from U for purposes of chapter 3 or 61. U's FFI1 debt interests are eligible for the paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) documentation exception because that account does not exceed the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, taking into account the aggregation rule described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section. However, U's common and preferred equity interests are not eligible for the paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) documentation exception because the accounts exceed the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, taking into account the aggregation rules described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4)(iii) pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section.

# Example 2. Aggregation rules for owners of entity accounts.
In Year 1, U, a U.S. resident individual, maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB, a commercial bank. The balance in U's depository account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $20,000. U also owns 100% of Entity X, which maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB, and 50% of Entity Y, which maintains a depository account that is a preexisting account in CB. The balance in Entity X's account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $130,000, and the balance in Entity Y's account on the effective date of CB's FFI agreement is $110,000. All three accounts are associated with one another in CB's computerized information management system by reference to U's foreign tax identification number. None of the accounts are managed by a relationship manager. Previously, CB was not required to and did not obtain a Form W-9 from U for purposes of chapter 3 or 61. U's depository account qualifies for the § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(i) exception to U.S. account status because it does not exceed the $50,000 threshold, taking into account the aggregation rule described in § 1.1471-5(a)(4)(iii)(A). Entity X's account and Entity Y's account both qualify for the paragraph (c)(3)(iii) documentation exception because the accounts do not exceed the $250,000 threshold described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section taking into account the aggregation rules described in § 1.1471-5(b)(
4
)(
iii
) pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(7)
Certifications of responsible officer.
In order for a participating FFI to comply with the requirements of an FFI agreement with respect to its identification procedures for preexisting accounts, a responsible officer of the participating FFI must certify to the IRS regarding the participating FFI's compliance with the diligence requirements of this paragraph (c). The responsible officer must certify that the participating FFI has completed the review of all high-value accounts as required under paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(D) and (E) of this section and treats any account holder of an account for which the participating FFI has not retained a record of any required documentation as a recalcitrant account holder as required under this section and § 1.1471-5(g). The responsible officer must also certify that the participating FFI has completed the account identification procedures and documentation requirements of this paragraph (c) for all other preexisting accounts or, if it has not retained a record of the documentation required under this paragraph (c) with respect to an account, treats such account in accordance with the requirements of this section and § 1.1471-5(g) or § 1.1471-3(f) (as applicable). The responsible officer must also certify to the best of the responsible officer's knowledge after conducting a reasonable inquiry, that the participating FFI did not have any formal or informal practices or procedures in
place from August 6, 2011, through the date that is two years after the effective date of the FFI's FFI agreement to assist account holders in the avoidance of chapter 4. A reasonable inquiry for purposes of this paragraph (c)(7) is a review of the participating FFI's procedures and a written inquiry, such as email requests to relevant lines of business, that requires responses from relevant customer on-boarding and management personnel as to whether they engaged in any such practices during that period. Practices or procedures that assist account holders in the avoidance of chapter 4 include, for example, suggesting that account holders split up accounts to avoid classification as a high-value account; suggesting that account holders of U.S. accounts close, transfer, or withdraw from their account to avoid reporting; intentional failures to disclose a known U.S. account; suggesting that an account holder remove U.S. indicia from its account information; or facilitating the manipulation of account balances or values to avoid thresholds. If the responsible officer is unable to make any of the certifications described in this paragraph (c)(7), the responsible officer must make a qualified certification to the IRS stating that such certification cannot be made and that corrective actions will be taken by the responsible officer. The certifications described in this paragraph (c)(7) must be submitted to the IRS by the due date of the FFI's first certification of compliance required under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

Account reporting
—(1)
Scope of paragraph.
This paragraph (d) provides rules addressing the information reporting requirements applicable to participating FFIs with respect to U.S. accounts, accounts held by owner-documented FFIs, and recalcitrant account holders. Paragraph (d)(2) of this section describes the accounts subject to reporting under this paragraph (d), and specifies the participating FFI that is responsible for reporting an account or account holder. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section describes the information required to be reported and the manner of reporting by a participating FFI under section 1471(c)(1) with respect to a U.S. account or an account held by an owner-documented FFI. Paragraph (d)(4) of this section provides definitions of terms applicable to paragraph (d)(3). Paragraph (d)(5) of this section describes the conditions for a participating FFI to elect to report its U.S. accounts and accounts held by owner-documented FFIs under section 1471(c)(2) and the information required to be reported under such election. Paragraph (d)(6) of this section provides rules for a participating FFI to report its recalcitrant account holders. Paragraph (d)(7) of this section provides special transitional reporting rules applicable to reports due in 2015 and 2016. Paragraph (d)(8) of this section provides the reporting requirements of a participating FFI that is a QI, WP, or WT with respect to U.S. accounts. See chapter 61 for reporting requirements that may apply to a payor that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with respect to payees. See § 301.1474-1(a) of this chapter for the requirement for a financial institution to file the information required under this paragraph (d) on magnetic media.

Reporting requirements in general
—(i)
(i)
Accounts subject to reporting.
Subject to the rules of paragraph (d)(7) of this section, a participating FFI shall report by the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, the information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to accounts maintained at any time during each calendar year for which the participating FFI is responsible for reporting under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and that it is required to treat as U.S. accounts or accounts held by owner-documented FFIs, including accounts that are identified as U.S. accounts by the end of such calendar year pursuant to a change in circumstances during such year as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Alternatively, a participating FFI may elect to report under paragraph (d)(5) of this section with respect to such accounts for each calendar year. With respect to accounts held by recalcitrant account holders, a participating FFI is required to report with respect to each calendar
year under paragraph (d)(6) of this section and not under paragraph (d)(3) or (5) of this section. For separate reporting requirements of participating FFIs with respect to foreign reportable amounts and for transitional rules for participating FFIs to report certain foreign reportable amounts paid to accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs, see § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F).
(ii)
Financial institution required to report an account
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B) through (G) of this section, the participating FFI that maintains the account is responsible for reporting the account in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iii), (d)(3), or (d)(5) of this section (as applicable) for each calendar year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a participating FFI is responsible for reporting accounts held by recalcitrant account holders that it maintains in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section. A participating FFI is not required to report the information required under paragraph (d)(6) of this section with respect to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder of another participating FFI even if that other participating FFI holds the account as an intermediary on behalf of such account holder and regardless of whether the participating FFI is required to report payments made to the recalcitrant account holder of such other FFI under § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii).
(B)
Special reporting of account holders of territory financial institutions.
In the case of an account held by a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary with respect to a withholdable payment—
(
1
) If the territory financial institution agrees to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to the payment under § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(F), a participating FFI is not required to report under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section with respect to the account holders of the territory financial institution; or
(
2
) If the territory financial institution does not agree to be treated as a U.S. person with respect to a withholdable payment, the participating FFI must report with respect to each specified U.S. person or substantial U.S. owner of an entity that is treated as a passive NFFE with respect to which the territory financial institution acts as an intermediary or is a flow-through entity and provides the participating FFI with the information and documentation required under § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(G). The participating FFI shall be treated as having satisfied these reporting requirements if it reports with respect to each such specified U.S. person or substantial U.S. owner of a passive NFFE either—
(
i
) The information required by chapter 61 and described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) or (d)(5)(iii) of this section (except account number); or
(
ii
) The information described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), or (d)(3)(iv) of this section (except account number and account balance or value).
(C)
Special reporting of account holders of a sponsored FFI.
A sponsoring entity that has agreed to fulfill the reporting responsibilities of this paragraph (d) on behalf of a sponsored FFI shall report in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iii), (3), or (5) of this section (as applicable) with respect to each U.S. account and paragraph (d)(6) of this section with respect to each account held by a recalcitrant account holder of the sponsored FFI to the extent and in the manner required if such sponsored FFI were a participating FFI. The sponsoring entity shall identify each sponsored FFI for which it is reporting to the extent required on the forms for reporting U.S. accounts and recalcitrant account holders and the accompanying instructions to the forms.
(D)
Special reporting of accounts held by owner-documented FFIs.
A participating FFI that maintains an account held by an FFI that it has agreed to treat as an owner-documented FFI under § 1.1471-3(d)(6) shall report the information described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) or (d)(5)(iii) of this section with respect to each specified U.S. person identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(
1
) and (
2
). See § 1.1474-1(i) for the reporting obligations of a participating FFI with respect to a payee of an obligation other than an account that it has
agreed to treat as an owner-documented FFI.
(E)
Requirement to identify the GIIN of a branch that maintains an account.
A participating FFI may report under paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(5) of this section either with respect to all of its U.S. accounts and recalcitrant accounts, or separately with respect to any clearly identified group of accounts (such as by line of business or the location of where the account is maintained). A participating FFI shall include the GIIN assigned to the participating FFI or its branches to identify the jurisdiction of the FFI or branch that maintains the accounts subject to reporting under paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(5) of this section. Additionally, a participating FFI shall file with the IRS the information required to be reported on accounts that it maintains in accordance with the forms and their accompanying instructions provided by the IRS. For the definition of a branch that applies for purposes of this paragraph (d), see paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(F)
Reporting by participating FFIs (including QIs, WPs, WTs, and certain U.S. branches not treated as U.S. persons) for accounts of nonparticipating FFIs (transitional).
Except as otherwise provided in the instructions to Form 8966, “FATCA Report” or in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(F), if a participating FFI (including a QI, WP, WT, or U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) maintains an account for a nonparticipating FFI (including a limited branch and limited FFI treated as a nonparticipating FFI), the participating FFI must report on Form 8966 the name and address of the nonparticipating FFI, and the aggregate amount of foreign source payments, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, paid to or with respect to each such account (foreign reportable amount) for each of the calendar years 2015 and 2016. If, however, the participating FFI is prohibited under domestic law from reporting on a specific payee basis without consent from the nonparticipating FFI account holder and the participating FFI has not been able to obtain such consent, the participating FFI may instead report the aggregate number of accounts held by such non-consenting nonparticipating FFIs and the aggregate amount of foreign reportable amounts paid with respect to such accounts, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, during the calendar year. A participating FFI may, in lieu of reporting only foreign reportable amounts, report all income, gross proceeds, and redemptions (irrespective of the source) paid to the nonparticipating FFI's account by the participating FFI during the calendar year. With respect to calendar year 2015, however, a participating FFI is not required to report gross proceeds described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(B)(
3
) of this section paid to an account held by a nonparticipating FFI. In addition, the participating FFI must retain the account statements related to such nonparticipating FFI accounts. See paragraphs (d)(6)(iv), through (vii) of this section for rules relating to reporting on recalcitrant account holders. Form 8966 shall be filed electronically with the IRS on or before March 31 of the year following the end of the calendar year to which the form relates.
(G)
Combined reporting on Form 8966 following merger or bulk acquisition.
If a participating FFI (successor) acquires accounts of another participating FFI (predecessor) in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts, the successor may assume the predecessor's obligations to report the acquired accounts under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to the calendar year in which the merger or acquisition occurs (acquisition year), provided that the requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(G)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section are satisfied. If the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(G)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section are not satisfied, both the predecessor and the successor are required to report the acquired accounts for the portion of the acquisition year that it maintains the account.
(
1
) The successor must acquire substantially all of the accounts maintained by the predecessor, or substantially all of the accounts maintained at a branch of the predecessor, in a merger or bulk acquisition of accounts for value.
(
2
) The successor must agree to report the acquired accounts for the acquisition year on Form 8966 to the extent required in § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (d)(5).
(
3
) The successor may not elect to report under section 1471(c)(2) and § 1.1471-4(d)(5) with respect to any acquired account that is a U.S. account for the acquisition year.
(
4
) The successor must notify the IRS on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS that Form 8966 is being filed on a combined basis.
(iii)
Special U.S. account reporting rules for U.S. payors
—
(A)
Special reporting rule for U.S. payors other than U.S. branches.
Participating FFIs that are U.S. payors (other than U.S. branches) shall be treated as having satisfied the chapter 4 reporting requirements described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section with respect to accounts that the participating FFI is required to treat as U.S. accounts, or accounts held by owner-documented FFIs, if the participating FFI reports with respect to each such account either—
(
1
) The information required by chapter 61 and described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) or (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or

1
) and (

the account from other accounts maintained by such institution.
(iii)
Account balance or value
—(A)
In general.
The participating FFI shall report the average balance or value of the account if the FFI reports average balance or value to the account holder for a calendar year. If the participating FFI does not report the average balance or value of the account to the account holder, the participating FFI shall report the balance or value of the account as of the end of the calendar year as determined in accordance with § 1.1471-5(b)(4). In the case of an account that is a cash value insurance or annuity contract, a participating FFI shall report the balance or value of the account as determined in accordance with § 1.1471-5(b)(4).
(B)
Currency translation of account balance or value.
The account balance or value of an account may be reported in U.S. dollars or in the currency in which the account is denominated. In the case of an account denominated in one or more foreign currencies, the participating FFI may elect to report the account balance or value in a currency in which the account is denominated and is required to identify the currency in which the account is reported. If the participating FFI elects to report such an account in U.S. dollars, the participating FFI must calculate the account balance or value of the account in the manner described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4).
(iv)
Payments made with respect to an account
—(A)
Depository accounts.
The payments made during a calendar year with respect to a depository account consist of the aggregate gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the year.
(B)
Custodial accounts.
The payments made during a calendar year with respect to a custodial account consist of—
(
1
) The aggregate gross amount of dividends paid or credited to the account during the calendar year;
(
2
) The aggregate gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the calendar year;
(
3
) The gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of property paid or credited to the account during the calendar year with respect to which the FFI acted as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the account holder; and
(
4
) The aggregate gross amount of all other income paid or credited to the account during the calendar year.
(C)
Other accounts.
In the case of an account described in § 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iii) (relating to a debt or equity interest other than an interest as a partner in a partnership) or § 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iv) (relating to cash value insurance contracts and annuity contracts), the payments made during the calendar year with respect to such account are the gross amounts paid or credited to the account holder during the calendar year including payments in redemption (in whole or part) of the account. In the case of an account that is a partner's interest in a partnership, the payments made during the calendar year with respect to such account are the amount of the partner's distributive share of the partnership's income or loss for the calendar year, without regard to whether any such amount is distributed to the partner during the year, and any guaranteed payments for the use of capital. The payments required to be reported under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(C) with respect to a partner may be determined based on the partnership's tax returns or, if the tax returns are unavailable by the due date for filing Form 8966, the partnership's financial statements or any other reasonable method used by the partnership for calculating the partner's share of partnership income by such date.
(D)
Transfers and closings of deposit, custodial, insurance, and annuity financial accounts.
In the case of an account closed or transferred in its entirety during a calendar year that is a depository account, custodial account, or a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the payments made with respect to the account shall be—
(
1
) The payments and income paid or credited to the account that are described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section for the calendar year until the date of transfer or closure; and
(
2
) The amount or value withdrawn or transferred from the account in connection with the closure or transfer of the account.
(E)
Amount and character of payments subject to reporting.
For purposes of reporting under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the amount and character of payments made with respect to an account may be determined under the same principles that the participating FFI uses to report information on its resident account holders to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the FFI (or branch thereof) is located. Thus, the amount and character of items of income described in paragraphs (d)(4)(iv)(A), (B), and (C) need not be determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. If any of the types of payments described in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section are not reported to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the participating FFI (or branch thereof) is located, such amounts may be determined in the same manner as is used by the participating FFI for purposes of reporting to the account holder. If any of the types of payments described in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) is neither reported to the tax administration of the jurisdiction in which the FFI (or branch thereof) is located nor reported to the account holder for the year for which reporting is required under paragraph (d) of this section, such item must be determined and reported either in accordance with U.S. federal tax principles or in accordance with any reasonable method of reporting that is consistent with the accounting principles generally applied by the participating FFI. Once a participating FFI (or branch thereof) has applied a method to determine such amounts, it must apply such method consistently for all account holders and for all subsequent years unless the Commissioner consents to a change in such method. Consent will be automatically granted for a change to rely on U.S. federal income tax principles to determine such amounts.
(F)
Currency translation.
A payment described in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) may be reported in the currency in which the payment is denominated or in U.S. dollars. In the case of payments denominated in one or more foreign currencies, a participating FFI may elect to report the payments in a currency in which payments are denominated and is required to identify the currency in which the account is reported. If such a payment is reported in U.S. dollars, the participating FFI must calculate the amount in the manner described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4).
(v)
Record retention requirements.
A participating FFI that produces, in the ordinary course of its business, account statements that summarize the activity (including withdrawals, transfers, and closures) of an account for any calendar year in which the account was required to be reported under paragraph (d)(3) of this section must retain a record of such account statements. The record must be retained for the longer of six years or the retention period under the FFI's normal business procedures. A participating FFI may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such an extension prior to the expiration of the six year period.
(5)
Election to perform chapter 61 reporting
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Election under section 1471(c)(2).
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5), a participating FFI may elect under section 1471(c)(2) and this paragraph (d)(5) to report under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, and 6049, as appropriate, with respect to any account required to be reported under this paragraph (d). Such reporting must be done as if such participating FFI were a U.S. payor and each holder of an account that is a specified U.S. person, passive NFFE that is a U.S. owned foreign entity, or owner-documented FFI were a payee who is an individual and citizen of the United States. If a participating FFI makes such an election, the FFI is required to report the information required under this paragraph (d)(5) with respect to each such U.S. account or account held by an owner-documented FFI, regardless of whether the account holder of such account qualifies as a recipient exempt from reporting by a payor or middleman under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, or 6049, including the reporting of payments made to such account of amounts that are subject to reporting under any of these sections. A participating FFI that elects to report an account under the election described in
this paragraph (d)(5) is required to report the information described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section for a calendar year regardless of whether a reportable payment was made to the U.S. account during the calendar year. A participating FFI that reports an account under the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) is not required to report the information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to the account. The election under section 1471(c)(2) described in this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A) does not apply to cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts that are financial accounts described in § 1.1471-5(b)(1)(iv). See paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section for an election to report cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts that are U.S. accounts held by specified U.S. persons in a manner similar to section 6047(d).
(B)
Election to report in a manner similar to section 6047(d).
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5), a participating FFI may elect to report with respect to any of its cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts that are U.S. accounts held by specified U.S. persons under section 6047(d), modified as follows. The amount to be reported is any amount paid under the contract during such reporting period as if such participating FFI were a U.S. payor. Each holder of a U.S. account that is a specified U.S. person is treated for purposes of reporting under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) as a contract holder or payee who is an individual and citizen of the United States.
(ii)
Additional information to be reported.
In addition to the information otherwise required to be reported under sections 6041, 6042, 6045, 6047(d) (in the manner described in paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section with respect to U.S. accounts held by specified U.S. persons), and 6049, including the reporting of payments made to such accounts subject to reporting under the applicable section, a participating FFI that elects to report under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) must report with respect to each account that it is required to treat as a U.S. account—

1
) The name, address, and TIN of the account holder; and
(
2
) The account number; and
(B) In the case of an account holder that is a U.S. owned foreign entity that is a passive NFFE—

(
2
) The name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner of such entity; and
(
3
) The account number.
(iii)
Special reporting of accounts held by owner-documented FFIs.
With respect to each account held by an owner-documented FFI, a participating FFI that elects to report under this paragraph (d)(5) must report payments made to the owner-documented FFI under the requirements of sections 6041, 6042, 6045, 6047(d), and 6049, the other information required under each applicable section, and the following information—
(A) The name of such FFI;
(B) The name, address, and TIN of each specified U.S. person identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(
1
) and (
2
); and
(C) The account number for the account held by the owner-documented FFI.
(iv)
Branch reporting.
A participating FFI that reports the information described in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section shall also report the jurisdiction of the branch that maintains the account being reported.
(v)
Time and manner of making the election.
A participating FFI (or one or more branches of the participating FFI) may make the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) by reporting the information described in this paragraph (d)(5) on the form described in paragraph (d)(5)(vii) of this section on the next reporting date following the end of the calendar year for which the election is made. A participating FFI may make an election under this paragraph (d)(5) either with respect to all of its U.S. accounts and recalcitrant accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of accounts (such as by line of business or the location where the account is maintained).
(vi)
Revocation of election.
A participating FFI may revoke the election described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section (as a whole or with regard to
any clearly identified group of accounts) by reporting the information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section beginning on the first reporting date with respect to the calendar year that follows the calendar year for which it last reports an account under this paragraph (d)(5).
(vii)
Filing of information under election.
In the case of an account holder that is a specified U.S. person, the information required to be reported under the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) shall be filed with the IRS and issued to the account holder in the time and manner prescribed in sections 6041, 6042, 6045, 6047(d), and 6049 and in accordance with the forms referenced therein and their accompanying instructions provided by the IRS for reporting under each of these sections. If the account holder is a passive NFFE that is a U.S. owned foreign entity or owner-documented FFI, however, the information required to be reported under the election described in this paragraph (d)(5) shall be filed on Form 8966 in accordance with its requirements and its accompanying instructions.

Definition of dormant account.
A dormant account is an account (other than a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract) that is a dormant or inactive account under applicable laws or regulations or the normal operating procedures of the participating FFI that are consistently applied for all accounts maintained by such institution in a particular jurisdiction. If neither applicable laws or regulations nor the normal operating procedures of the participating FFI maintaining the account address dormant or inactive accounts, an account will be a dormant account if—

In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(1) or paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, each FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group must have the chapter 4 status of a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner as a condition for any member of such group to obtain the status of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section, each FFI other than a certified deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner in an expanded affiliated group must submit a registration form to the IRS in such manner as the IRS may prescribe requesting an FFI agreement, registered deemed-compliant status, or limited FFI status as a condition for any member to become a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each FFI other than a certified deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner that is a member of such group must also agree to all of the requirements for the status for which it applies with respect to all accounts maintained at all of its branches, offices, and divisions. For the withholding requirements of a participating FFI with respect to its limited branches and its affiliates that are limited FFIs, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an FFI (or branch thereof) that is treated as a participating FFI or a deemed-compliant FFI pursuant to a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA will maintain such status provided that it meets the terms for such status pursuant to such agreement.
(2)

(A) With respect to accounts that pursuant to this section the participating FFI is required to treat as U.S. accounts, either report such accounts to the IRS as described in paragraph (d) of this section, close such accounts within a reasonable period of time, or
transfer such accounts to a U.S. financial institution, a branch of the FFI that will so report, a participating FFI, or a reporting Model 1 FFI.
(B) With respect to recalcitrant account holders and accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs, withhold with respect to each such account as required under paragraph (b) of this section, block each such account (as defined in this paragraph), close each such account within a reasonable period of time, or transfer each such account to a U.S. financial institution, a branch of the FFI that will so report, a participating FFI, or a reporting Model 1 FFI. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B), an account is a blocked account if the FFI prohibits the account holder from effecting any transactions with respect to an account until such time as the account is closed, transferred, or the account holder provides the documentation described in paragraph (c) of this section for the FFI to determine the U.S. or non-U.S. status of the account and report the account if required under paragraph (d) of this section.
(iv)
Conditions for limited branch status.
An FFI with one or more limited branches must satisfy the following requirements when applying for participating FFI status with the IRS—
(A) Identify the relevant jurisdiction of each branch for which it seeks limited branch status;

A branch will cease to be a limited branch as of the beginning of the third calendar quarter following the date on which the branch is no longer prohibited from complying with the requirements of a participating FFI as described in this section. In such case, a participating FFI will retain its status as a participating FFI if it notifies the IRS by the date such branch ceases to be a limited branch that it will comply with the requirements of an FFI agreement with respect to such branch, or if otherwise provided pursuant to a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA.
(vi)
Exception from restriction on opening U.S. accounts and accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs.
Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, a branch may open U.S. accounts for persons resident in the same jurisdiction in which such branch is located or operating and accounts for nonparticipating FFIs that are resident in the same jurisdiction provided that—

(B) The branch is not used by the FFI or any FFI in its expanded affiliated group to circumvent the obligations of such FFI under section 1471.
(3)
Limited FFI
—(i)
In general.
An FFI will be allowed to become either a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI notwithstanding that one or more of the FFIs in the expanded affiliated group of which the FFI is a member cannot comply with all of the requirements of a participating FFI as described in this section if each such FFI is a limited FFI under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Limited FFI defined.
A limited FFI is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more participating FFIs that agrees to the conditions described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section to become a limited FFI and if under the laws of each jurisdiction that apply with respect to the accounts maintained by the affiliate, the affiliate cannot satisfy the conditions of both paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.

(C) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section, agree as part of such registration that it will not open accounts that it is required to treat as U.S. accounts or accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs, including accounts transferred from any member of its expanded affiliated group; and
(D) Agree as part of such registration that it will identify itself to withholding agents as a nonparticipating FFI.
(iv)
Period for limited FFI status (transitional).
A limited FFI will cease to be a limited FFI after December 31, 2016. An FFI will also cease to be a limited FFI when it becomes a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI, or as of the beginning of the third calendar quarter following the date on which the FFI is no longer prohibited from complying with the requirements of a participating FFI as described in this section. In such case, participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs that are members of the same expanded affiliated group will retain their status if, by the date that an FFI ceases to be a limited FFI, such FFI enters into an FFI agreement or becomes a registered deemed-compliant FFI, unless otherwise provided pursuant to an applicable Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA.
(v)
Exception from registration requirement
—(A)
Conditions for exception.
An FFI that seeks to become a limited FFI is excepted from the registration requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section provided that—
(
1
) The FFI is prohibited under local law from registering as a limited FFI;
(
2
) A member of the FFI's expanded affiliated group that is a U.S. financial institution or an FFI seeking status as (or that is) a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI registers as a lead FI (defined in the Instructions for
Form 8957, “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Registration”) with respect to the limited FFI; and
(
3
) The lead FI identifies the limited FFI on the lead FI's FATCA registration. However, if the limited FFI is prohibited under applicable law from being identified by its legal name on the FATCA registration Web site, the lead FI may use the term
Limited FFI
in place of the limited FFI's name and indicate the limited FFI's jurisdiction of residence or organization.
(B)
Confirmation requirements of lead FI.
By identifying a limited FFI on the FATCA registration Web site pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A)(
2
) of this section, the lead FI is confirming that—
(
1
) The limited FFI has represented to the lead FI that it will meet the conditions for limited FFI status described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section;
(
2
) The limited FFI has agreed to notify the lead FI within 30 days of the date that such FFI ceases to meet the requirements of a limited FFI or the date that such FFI can comply with the requirements of a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (and will separately register for that status); and
(
3
) The lead FI, if it receives a notification described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section or otherwise knows that the limited FFI has not complied with the conditions for limited FFI status or can comply with the requirements of a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI, will, within 90 days of such notification or acquiring such knowledge, remove the FFI from the lead FI's registration on the FATCA registration Web site and maintain a record of the date on which the FFI ceased to be a limited FFI and (if applicable) the circumstances of the limited FFI's non-compliance, which will be available to the IRS upon request.
(vi)
Exception from restriction on opening U.S. accounts and accounts held by nonparticipating FFIs.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, a limited FFI may open U.S. accounts for persons resident in the same jurisdiction in which such FFI is resident or organized and accounts for nonparticipating FFIs that are resident in the same jurisdiction provided that—
(A) Such FFI does not solicit U.S. accounts or accounts for nonparticipating FFIs from persons not resident in the same jurisdiction in which the FFI is resident or organized; and
(B) The FFI is not used by another FFI in the FFI's expanded affiliated group to circumvent the obligations of such other FFI under section 1471.
(4)
Special rule for QIs.
An FFI that has in effect a QI agreement with the IRS will be allowed to become a limited FFI notwithstanding that none of the FFIs in the expanded affiliated group of which the FFI is a member can comply with the requirements of a participating FFI as described in this section if the FFI that is a QI meets the conditions of a limited FFI under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(f)
Verification
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) describes the requirement for a participating FFI to establish and implement a compliance program for satisfying its requirements under this section. Paragraph (f)(2) of this section provides the requirement for a participating FFI to establish a compliance program and the option for a group of FFIs to adopt a consolidated compliance program. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section describes the periodic certification that the participating FFI must make to the IRS regarding the participating FFI's compliance with the requirements of an FFI agreement. Paragraph (f)(4) describes IRS information requests related to compliance with an FFI agreement.
(2)
Compliance program
—(i)
In general.
The participating FFI must appoint a responsible officer to oversee the participating FFI's compliance with the requirements of the FFI agreement. The responsible officer must (either personally or through designated persons) establish a compliance program that includes policies, procedures, and processes sufficient for the participating FFI to satisfy the requirements of the FFI agreement. The responsible officer (or designee) must periodically review the sufficiency of the FFI's compliance program and the FFI's compliance with the requirements of an FFI agreement during the certification period described in paragraph
(f)(3) of this section. The results of the periodic review must be considered by the responsible officer in making the periodic certifications required under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Consolidated compliance program
—(A)
In general.
A participating FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group that includes one or more FFIs may elect to be part of a consolidated compliance program (and perform a consolidated periodic review) under the authority of a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution (compliance FI) that is a member of the electing FFI's expanded affiliated group, regardless of whether all such members so elect. In addition, when an FFI elects to be part of a consolidated compliance program, each branch that it maintains (including a limited branch or a branch described in § 1.1471-5(f)(1)), other than a branch located in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction, must be subject to periodic review as part of such program and included on the periodic certification (described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section). To the extent that a compliance FI satisfies the certification requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on behalf of an electing FFI, such electing FFI does not have a certification requirement under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. See § 1.1471-5(j) for the requirement of a sponsoring entity to establish and implement a compliance program for its sponsored FFIs.
(B)
Requirements of compliance FI.
A participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution that agrees to establish and maintain a consolidated compliance program and perform a consolidated periodic review on behalf of one or more FFIs (the compliance group), must agree to identify itself as the compliance FI and identify each FFI for which it acts (an electing FFI) to the extent required by the IRS as part of the FFI registration process or certification procedures. The agreement between the compliance FI and each electing FFI must permit either the compliance FI or the electing FFI to terminate the agreement upon a finding by the IRS or by either party that the other party to the agreement is not fulfilling its obligations under the agreement or is no longer able to fulfill such obligations.
(

)
Periodic certification
—(
i
)
In general.
On or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of the certification period, the responsible officer of the compliance FI must make the certification described in either paragraph (f)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section with respect to all electing FFIs for which it acts during the certification period on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. The certification must be made on behalf of all electing FFIs in the compliance group during the certification period, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section. The first certification period for a compliance group begins on the later of the date the compliance FI is issued a GIIN or June 30, 2014, and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following such date. Each subsequent certification period is the three-calendar-year period following the previous certification period.
(
ii
)
Late-joining electing FFIs.
In general, with respect to a certification period, a compliance FI is not required to make a certification for an electing FFI that first elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI during the six-month period before the end of the certification period, provided that the compliance FI makes certifications for such electing FFI for subsequent certification periods, and the first such certification covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period of the compliance group during which such FFI was an electing FFI in the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to an electing FFI that, immediately before the electing FFI elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program, was a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. The compliance FI may certify for an electing FFI described in the preceding sentence for the portion of the certification period of the compliance group before the date that the electing FFI elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program if the compliance FI obtains
from the FFI (or the FFI's former compliance FI, if applicable) a written certification that the FFI has complied with its applicable chapter 4 requirements during such portion of the certification period, provided that: The compliance FI does not know that such certification is unreliable or incorrect; and the certification for the electing FFI for the subsequent certification period covers both the subsequent certification period and the portion of the prior certification period during which such FFI was an electing FFI in the consolidated compliance program of the compliance FI.
(
2
)
Preexisting account certification.
The responsible officer of a compliance FI must make the certification described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section (preexisting account certification of a participating FFI) with respect to each electing FFI that elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI during the certification period. However, a preexisting account certification is not required for an electing FFI if immediately before electing to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI the FFI was a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is a local FFI or restricted fund, and the FFI (or the FFI's former compliance FI, if applicable) provides a written certification to the compliance FI that the FFI has made the preexisting account certification required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section or § 1.1471-5(f)(1)(i)(A)(
7
) or (f)(1)(i)(D)(
6
) (as applicable), unless the compliance FI knows that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect. In addition, a preexisting account certification is not required for an electing FFI that elects to be part of the consolidated compliance program under the compliance FI during the two year period before the end of the certification period, provided that the compliance FI makes the preexisting account certification for such FFI for the subsequent certification period. The certification required under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) for the certification period must be submitted by the due date of the FFI's certification of compliance required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section for the certification period, on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS.
(3)
Certification of compliance
—(i)
In general.
In addition to the certifications required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, on or before July 1 of the calendar year following the end of each certification period, the responsible officer must make the certification described in either paragraph (f)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section on the form and in the manner prescribed by the IRS. The first certification period begins on the effective date of the FFI agreement and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following the effective date of the FFI agreement. Each subsequent certification period is the three-calendar-year period following the previous certification period, unless the FFI agreement provides for a different period. The responsible officer must either certify that the participating FFI maintains effective internal controls or, if the participating FFI has identified an event of default (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) or a material failure (defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section) that it has not corrected as of the date of the certification, must make the qualified certification described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. The certification of compliance described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section may be modified through an amendment to the FFI agreement to include any additional certifications or information (such as quantitative or factual information related to the FFI's compliance with the FFI agreement), provided that any additional information or certifications are published at least 90 days before being incorporated into the FFI agreement to allow for public comment.
(ii)
Certification of effective internal controls.
The responsible officer must certify to the following statements—
(A) The responsible officer (or designee) has established a compliance program that is in effect as of the date of the certification and that has been subjected to the review as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section;
(B) With respect to material failures—
(
1
) There are no material failures for the certification period; or
(
2
) If there are any material failures, appropriate actions were taken to remediate such failures and to prevent such failures from reoccurring; and
(C) With respect to any failure to withhold, deposit, or report to the extent required under the FFI agreement, the FFI has corrected such failure by paying any taxes due (including interest and penalties) and filing the appropriate return (or amended return).
(iii)
Qualified certification.
If the responsible officer has identified an event of default or a material failure that the participating FFI has not corrected as of the date of the certification, the responsible officer must certify to the following statements—
(A) With respect to the event of default or material failure—
(
1
) The responsible officer (or designee) has identified an event of default as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; or
(
2
) The responsible officer has determined that as of the date of the certification, there are one or more material failures with respect to the participating FFI's compliance with the FFI agreement and that appropriate actions will be taken to prevent such failures from reoccurring;
(B) With respect to any failure to withhold, deposit, or report to the extent required under the FFI agreement, the FFI will correct such failure by paying any taxes due (including interest and penalties) and filing the appropriate return (or amended return); and
(C) The responsible officer (or designee) will respond to any notice of default (if applicable) or will provide to the IRS, to the extent requested, a description of each material failure and a written plan to correct each such failure.
(iv)
Material failures defined.
A material failure is a failure of the participating FFI to fulfill the requirements of the FFI agreement if the failure was the result of a deliberate action on the part of one or more employees of the participating FFI (its agent, sponsor, or compliance FI) to avoid the requirements of the FFI agreement or was an error attributable to a failure of the participating FFI to implement internal controls sufficient for the participating FFI to meet the requirements of this section. A material failure will not constitute an event of default unless such material failure occurs in more than limited circumstances when a participating FFI has not substantially complied with the requirements of an FFI agreement. Material failures include the following—
(A) The deliberate or systemic failure of the participating FFI to report accounts that it was required to treat as U.S. accounts, withhold on passthru payments to the extent required, deposit taxes withheld, or accurately report recalcitrant account holders or payees that are nonparticipating FFIs as required;
(B) A criminal or civil penalty or sanction imposed on the participating FFI (or any branch or office thereof) by a regulator or other governmental authority or agency with oversight over the participating FFI's compliance with the AML due diligence procedures to which it (or any branch or office thereof) is subject and that is imposed based on a failure to properly identify account holders under the requirements of those procedures; and
(C) A potential future tax liability related to the participating FFI's compliance (or lack thereof) with the FFI agreement for which the FFI establishes, for financial statement purposes, a tax reserve or provision.
(4)
IRS review of compliance
—(i)
General inquiries.
The IRS, based upon the information reporting forms described in paragraphs (d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) of this section filed with the IRS (or the absence of such reporting) for each calendar year, may request additional information with respect to the information reported (or required to be reported) on the forms or may request the account statements described in paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, or confirmation that the FFI has no accounts that it was required to report. The IRS may also request any additional information to determine an FFI's compliance with its FFI agreement and to assist the IRS with its review of account holder compliance with tax reporting requirements.
(ii)
Inquiries regarding substantial non-compliance.
If, based on the information
reporting forms described in paragraphs (d)(3)(v), (d)(5)(vii), or (d)(6)(iv) of this section filed with the IRS for each calendar year, the certifications made by the responsible officer described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or any other information related to the participating FFI's compliance with its FFI agreement, the IRS determines in its discretion that the participating FFI may not have substantially complied with the requirements of its FFI agreement, the IRS may request from the responsible officer (or designee) information necessary to verify the participating FFI's compliance with the FFI agreement. The IRS may request, for example, a description or copy of the participating FFI's policies and procedures for fulfilling the requirements of the FFI agreement, a description of the participating FFI's procedures for conducting its periodic review, or a copy of any written reports documenting the findings of such review in order to evaluate the sufficiency of the participating FFI's compliance program and review of such program. The IRS may also request the performance of specified review procedures by a person (including an external auditor or third-party consultant) that the IRS identifies as competent to perform such procedures given the facts and circumstances surrounding the FFI's potential failure to comply with the FFI agreement. The IRS may make these requests to a sponsoring entity with respect to any sponsored FFI.
(g)
Event of default
—(1)
Defined.
An event of default occurs if a participating FFI fails to perform material obligations required with respect to the due diligence, verification, withholding, or reporting requirements of the FFI agreement or if the IRS determines that the participating FFI has failed to substantially comply with the requirements of the FFI agreement. An event of default also includes the occurrence of the following—
(i) Failure to obtain, in any case in which foreign law would (but for a waiver) prevent the reporting of U.S. accounts required under paragraph (d) of this section, valid and effective waivers from holders of U.S. accounts or failure to otherwise close or transfer such U.S. accounts as required under paragraph (i) of this section;
(ii) Failure to significantly reduce, over a period of time, the number of account holders or payees that the participating FFI is required to treat as recalcitrant account holders or nonparticipating FFIs, as a result of the participating FFI failing to comply with the due diligence procedures for the identification and documentation of account holders and payees, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;
(iii) Failure, in any case in which foreign law prevents or otherwise limits withholding to the extent required under paragraph (b) of this section, to fulfill the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section;
(iv) Failure to establish or maintain a compliance program for fulfilling the requirements of the FFI agreement or to perform a periodic review of the participating FFI's compliance;
(v) Failure to take timely corrective actions to remedy a material failure described in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section after making the qualified certification described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section;
(vi) Failure to make the initial certification required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section or to make the periodic certification required under paragraph (f)(3) of this section within the specified time period;
(vii) Making incorrect claims for refund under the collective refund procedures described in paragraph (h) of this section;
(viii) Failure to cooperate with an IRS request for additional information or making any fraudulent statement or misrepresentation of material fact to the IRS; or

(2)
Notice of event of default.
Following an event of default known by or disclosed to the IRS, the IRS will deliver to the participating FFI a notice of default specifying the event of default. The IRS will request that the participating FFI remediate the event
of default within 45 days (unless additional time is requested and agreed to by the IRS). The participating FFI must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the participating FFI does not agree that an event of default has occurred. Taking into account the terms of any applicable Model 2 IGA, if the participating FFI does not provide a response within the specified time period, the IRS may, at its sole discretion, deliver a notice of termination that terminates the FFI's participating FFI status. If the FFI's participating FFI status is terminated, in addition to the requirements in § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(E)(
2
), the FFI must, within 30 days of the termination, send notice of the termination to each withholding agent from which it receives payments and each financial institution with which it holds an account for which a withholding certificate or other documentation was provided. An FFI that has had its participating FFI status terminated may not reregister on the FATCA registration website as a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI unless it receives written approval from the IRS to register. A participating FFI may request, within 90 days of a notice of default or notice of termination, reconsideration of a notice of default or notice of termination by written request to the IRS.
(3)
Remediation of event of default.
A participating FFI will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent that it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. Such a plan may, for example, allow a participating FFI to remediate an event of default described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section by providing specific information regarding its U.S. accounts when the FFI has been unable to report all of the information with respect to such accounts as required under paragraph (d) of this section and has been unable to close or transfer such accounts. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the FFI or the performance of the specified review procedures described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.
(h)
Collective credit or refund procedures for overpayments
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in the FFI agreement, if there has been an overpayment of tax with respect to an account holder or payee of a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI resulting from tax withheld under chapter 4 by either the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI or by its withholding agent during a calendar year and the amount withheld has not been recovered under the reimbursement or set-off procedures described in § 1.1474-2(a) (applied by either the withholding agent or the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI), the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI may request a credit or refund from the IRS of the overpayment to the extent permitted under this paragraph (h) on behalf of such account holder or payee. For purposes of this paragraph (h), an overpayment means an amount withheld in excess of the account holder or payee's U.S. tax liability with respect to the payment (including overwithholding as defined § 1.1474-2(a)(2)). If a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI does not elect the procedure provided in this paragraph (h) to request a credit or refund, the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI is required to (or must request that its withholding agent) file and furnish within a reasonable period a Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and Form 1042 (or amended forms) to report to any account holder or payee that has requested such form with regard to the tax withheld by the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI or its withholding agent.
(2)
Persons for which a collective refund is not permitted.
A participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI cannot include in its collective refund claim any payments made to an account holder or payee that is a nonparticipating FFI, a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI that is a flow-through entity (including a WP or WT) or that is acting as an intermediary (including a QI), a U.S. person, or a passive NFFE that is a flow-through entity with respect to taxes allocated to its substantial U.S. owners. A participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI must follow the procedures set forth under sections 6402 and 6414 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by this paragraph (h), to
claim the credit or refund. No credit or refund will be allowed after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation for refunds under section 6511.
(3)
Payments for which a collective refund is permitted.
A collective refund is permitted only for payments withheld upon under chapter 4.
(4)
Procedural and other requirements for collective refund.
A participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI may use the collective refund procedures of this paragraph (h) under the following conditions—
(i) All account holders and payees for which the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI seeks a refund must have been included on a Form 1042-S in a reporting pool of nonparticipating FFIs or recalcitrant account holders described in § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii) with respect to the payments for which refund is sought and the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI (or the withholding agent) has not filed or furnished a Form 1042-S to any such account holder or payee with respect to which the refund is sought;
(ii) If a refund is sought on the grounds that the account holder or payee of a payment that is U.S. source FDAP income subject to withholding under chapter 3 is entitled to a reduced rate of tax by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States, the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI has also obtained valid documentation that meets the requirements of chapter 3 for a reduced rate of tax and such documentation is available to the IRS upon request with respect to each such account holder or payee; and
(iii) In filing a claim for refund with the IRS under this paragraph (h), the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI submits the following, together with its Form 1042 (or amended Form 1042) on which it provides a reconciliation of amounts withheld and claims a credit or refund, a schedule identifying the taxes withheld with respect to each account holder or payee to which the claim relates, and, if applicable, a copy of the Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) furnished to the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI by its withholding agent reporting the taxes withheld to which the claim relates, and a statement that includes the following representations and explanation—
(A) The reason(s) for the overpayment;
(B) A representation that the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI or its withholding agent deposited the tax for which a refund is being sought under section 6302 and has not applied the reimbursement or set-off procedure of § 1.1474-2 to adjust the tax withheld to which the claim relates;
(C) A representation that the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI has repaid or will repay the amount for which refund is sought to the appropriate account holders or payees;
(D) A representation that the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI retains a record showing the total amount of tax withheld, credits from other withholding agents, tax assumed by the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI, adjustments for underwithholding, and reimbursements for overwithholding as its relates to each account holder and payee and also showing the repayment to such account holders or payees for the amount of tax for which a refund is being sought;
(E) A representation that the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI retains valid documentation that meets the requirements of chapters 3 (if applicable) and 4 to substantiate the amount of overwithholding with respect to each account holder and payee for which a refund is being sought and that such documentation is available to the IRS upon request; and
(F) A representation that the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI will not issue a Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to any account holder or payee for which a refund is being sought.
(i)
Legal prohibitions on reporting U.S. accounts and withholding
—(1)
In general.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in a Model 2 IGA, a participating FFI (or branch thereof) that is prohibited by foreign law from reporting the information required under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to a U.S. account must follow the procedures of paragraph (i)(2) of this section to obtain a valid and effective waiver of such law and, if such waiver is not
obtained within a reasonable period of time, to close or transfer such account. A participating FFI (or branch thereof) that is prohibited by law from withholding with respect to a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI as required under paragraph (b) of this section is required to perform the procedures of paragraph (i)(3) of this section to obtain an authorization to withhold on payments made to the account holder or payee to the extent required under paragraph (b) of this section, close the account or terminate the obligation (as applicable), or to sell the assets in the account that produce (or could produce) withholdable payments and, if such authorization is not obtained within a reasonable period of time, to transfer or block such account or obligation. An FFI that cannot comply with any of the requirements of this paragraph (i) is not eligible to enter into an FFI agreement with the IRS, but may obtain status as a limited FFI if the FFI meets the requirements and agrees to the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If a branch of an FFI cannot comply with the requirements of this paragraph (i), then the FFI must agree to the conditions of a limited branch as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to obtain status as a participating FFI.
(2)
Requesting waiver or closure of a U.S. account
—(i)
In general.
If a participating FFI (or branch thereof) is prohibited by law from reporting the information required under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to a U.S. account that it maintains unless a valid and effective waiver of such law is obtained, the participating FFI must request a valid and effective waiver (including by obtaining waivers from all relevant account holders if necessary). For accounts other than preexisting accounts, the participating FFI must obtain a valid and effective waiver upon opening the account or, if prohibitions on disclosure cannot by law be waived, the participating FFI must refrain from opening accounts that are U.S. accounts or must transfer such accounts as described in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. Beginning on the date provided in § 1.1471-5(g)(3) and until such time as the holder of a U.S. account either consents to disclosure or closure of the account or until the account is transferred, the participating FFI is required to treat the account as held by a recalcitrant account holder.
(ii)
Valid and effective waiver for a U.S. account.
For purposes of this paragraph (i)(2), a valid and effective waiver is a waiver that, under the applicable law governing the participating FFI's agreement with the account holder, permits the participating FFI (or branch thereof) to report to the IRS all of the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section with respect to the U.S. account and permits the FFI to provide the IRS with additional information concerning such account as specified in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section.
(iii)
Closure or transfer of U.S. account.
If the participating FFI (or branch thereof) is prohibited by law from reporting a U.S. account to the IRS under paragraph (d) of this section and the participating FFI either does not obtain a valid and effective waiver (and Form W-9) or prohibitions on disclosure cannot by law be waived, the participating FFI (or branch thereof) must close or transfer the account within a reasonable time. If the participating FFI cannot close or transfer the account absent the account holder consenting to closure, the participating FFI must request such a consent from such account holder and, if obtained, close or transfer the account within a reasonable period of time.
(3)
Legal prohibitions preventing withholding
—(i)
In general.
If the participating FFI (or branch thereof) is prohibited by law from withholding with respect to payments subject to withholding under paragraph (b) of this section, the participating FFI (or a branch thereof) must obtain the authorization described in this paragraph (i)(3)(i) from each account holder or payee receiving such payments to either withhold, close the account or terminate the obligation, or sell all of the assets in the account that produce (or could produce) withholdable payments. If the participating FFI does not receive such authorization from the account holder or payee within a reasonable period of time, the participating FFI must block
or transfer such accounts or obligations as described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Block or transfer accounts or obligations.
If the participating FFI does not receive the authorization described in paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section from the account holder or payee within a reasonable period of time and is prohibited by law from closing accounts or terminating obligations with account holders or payees as described in paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, the participating FFI must either block or transfer such accounts or obligations prior to the date on which the participating FFI would otherwise be required to withhold under paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for when an account is considered blocked. A transfer of an account or obligation must be made to a branch of the FFI that may so withhold or to a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI.
