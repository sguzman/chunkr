§ 187.313
Effect of certificate of title.
A certificate of title is
prima facie
evidence of the accuracy of the information in the record that constitutes the certificate.
§ 187.314
Effect of possession of certificate of title; judicial process.
Possession of a certificate of title does not by itself provide a right to obtain possession of a vessel. Garnishment, attachment, levy, replevin, or other judicial process against the certificate is not effective to determine possessory rights to the vessel. This subpart does not prohibit enforcement under State law, other than this subpart (33 CFR part 187 subpart D), of a security interest in, levy on, or foreclosure of a statutory or common-law lien on a vessel. Absence of an indication of a statutory or common-law lien on a certificate does not invalidate the lien.
§ 187.315
Perfection of security interest.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section or a savings clause provided under state law, a security interest in a vessel may be perfected only by delivery to the office of an application for a certificate of title that identifies the secured party and otherwise complies with § 187.307. The security interest is perfected on the later of delivery to the office of the application and the applicable fee or attachment of the security interest as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods.
(b) If the interest of a person named as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor in an application for a certificate of title delivered to the office is a security interest, the application sufficiently identifies the person as a secured party. Identification on the application for a certificate of a person as owner, lessor, consignor, or bailor is not by itself a factor in determining whether the person's interest is a security interest.
(c) If the office has created a certificate of title for a vessel, a security interest in the vessel may be perfected by delivery to the office of an application, on a form the office may require, to have the security interest added to the certificate. The application must be signed by an owner of the vessel or by the secured party and must include—
(1) The name of the owner of record;
(2) The name and mailing address of the secured party;
(3) The hull identification number (HIN) for the vessel; and
(4) If the office has created a written certificate of title for the vessel, the certificate.
(d) A security interest perfected under paragraph (c) of this section is perfected on the later of delivery to the office of the application and all applicable fees or attachment of the security interest as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods.
(e) On delivery of an application that complies with paragraph (c) of this section and payment of all applicable fees, the office must create a new certificate of title pursuant to § 187.308 and deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate pursuant to § 187.312(a). The office must maintain in the files of the office the date and time of delivery of the application to the office.
(f) If a secured party assigns a perfected security interest in a vessel, the receipt by the office of a statement providing the name of the assignee as secured party is not required to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees from the original debtor. Upon obtaining a release from the secured party indicated in the files of the office or on the certificate, a purchaser of a vessel subject to a security interest takes free of the security interest and of the rights of a transferee unless the transfer is indicated in the files of the office or on the certificate.
(g) This section does not apply to a security interest—
(1) Created in a vessel by a person during any period in which the vessel is inventory held for sale or lease by the person or is leased by the person as lessor if the person is in the business of selling vessels;
(2) In a barge for which no application for a certificate of title has been delivered to the office; or
(3) In a vessel before delivery if the vessel is under construction, or completed, pursuant to contract and for which no application for a certificate has been delivered to the office.
(h) This paragraph applies if a certificate of documentation for a documented vessel is deleted or canceled. If a security interest in the vessel was
valid immediately before deletion or cancellation against a third party as a result of compliance with 42 U.S.C. 31321, the security interest is and remains perfected until the earlier of 4 months after cancellation of the certificate or the time the security interest becomes perfected under this subpart.
(i) A security interest in a vessel arising under State law related to security interests in goods is perfected when it attaches but becomes unperfected when the debtor obtains possession of the vessel, unless before the debtor obtains possession the security interest is perfected pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section.
(j) A security interest in a vessel as proceeds of other collateral is perfected to the extent provided in State law.
(k) A security interest in a vessel perfected under the law of another jurisdiction is perfected to the extent provided in State law.
§ 187.316
Termination statement.
(a) A secured party indicated in the files of the office as having a security interest in a vessel must deliver a termination statement to the office and, on the debtor's request, to the debtor, by the earlier of—
(1) Twenty days after the secured party receives a signed demand from an owner for a termination statement and there is no obligation secured by the vessel subject to the security interest and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value secured by the vessel; or
(2) If the vessel is consumer goods, 30 days after there is no obligation secured by the vessel and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value secured by the vessel.
(b) If a written certificate of title has been created and delivered to a secured party and a termination statement is required under paragraph (a) of this section, the secured party, not later than the date required by paragraph (a), must deliver the certificate to the debtor or to the office with the statement. If the certificate is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or is otherwise unavailable or illegible, the secured party must deliver with the statement, not later than the date required by paragraph (a), an application for a replacement certificate meeting the requirements of § 187.322.
(c) On delivery to the office of a termination statement authorized by the secured party, the security interest to which the statement relates ceases to be perfected. If the security interest to which the statement relates was indicated on the certificate of title, the office must create a new certificate and deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate. The office must maintain in its files the date and time of delivery to the office of the statement.
(d) A secured party that fails to comply with this section is liable for any loss that the secured party had reason to know might result from its failure to comply and which could not reasonably have been prevented and for the cost of an application for a certificate of title under § 187.307 or § 187.322.
§ 187.317
Transfer of ownership.
(a) On voluntary transfer of an ownership interest in a vessel covered by a certificate of title, the following rules apply:
(1) If the certificate is a written certificate of title and the transferor's interest is noted on the certificate, the transferor must promptly sign the certificate and deliver it to the transferee. If the transferor does not have possession of the certificate, the person in possession of the certificate has a duty to facilitate the transferor's compliance with this paragraph. A secured party does not have a duty to facilitate the transferor's compliance with this paragraph if the proposed transfer is prohibited by the security agreement.
(2) If the certificate of title is an electronic certificate of title, the transferor must promptly sign and deliver to the transferee a record evidencing the transfer of ownership to the transferee.
(3) The transferee has a right enforceable by specific performance to require the transferor comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
(b) The creation of a certificate of title identifying the transferee as
owner of record satisfies paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) A failure to comply with paragraph (a) or to apply for a new certificate of title does not render a transfer of ownership of a vessel ineffective between the parties. Except as otherwise provided in § 187.318, § 187.319, § 187.323(a), or § 187.324, a transfer of ownership without compliance with paragraph (a) of this section is not effective against another person claiming an interest in the vessel.
(d) A transferor that complies with paragraph (a) of this section is not liable as owner of the vessel for an event occurring after the transfer, regardless of whether the transferee applies for a new certificate of title.
§ 187.318
Effect of missing or incorrect information.
Except as otherwise provided as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods, a certificate of title or other record required or authorized by this subpart is effective even if it contains incorrect information or does not contain required information.
§ 187.319
Transfer of ownership by secured party's transfer statement.
(a) In this section, “secured party's transfer statement” means a record signed by the secured party of record stating—
(1) That there has been a default on an obligation secured by the vessel;
(2) The secured party of record is exercising or has exercised post-default remedies with respect to the vessel;
(3) By reason of the exercise, the secured party of record has the right to transfer the ownership interest of an owner, and the name of the owner;
(4) The name and last known mailing address of the owner of record and the secured party of record;
(5) The name of the transferee;
(6) Other information required by § 187.307(b); and
(7) One of the following:
(i) The certificate of title is an electronic certificate;
(ii) The secured party does not have possession of the written certificate of title created in the name of the owner of record; or
(iii) The secured party is delivering the written certificate of title to the office with the secured party's transfer statement.
(b) Unless the office rejects a secured party's transfer statement for a reason stated in § 187.308(c), not later than 20 days after delivery to the office of the statement and payment of fees and taxes payable under State law in connection with the statement or the acquisition or use of the vessel, the office must—
(1) Accept the statement;
(2) Amend the files of the office to reflect the transfer; and
(3) If the name of the owner whose ownership interest is being transferred is indicated on the certificate of title—
(i) Cancel the certificate even if the certificate has not been delivered to the office;
(ii) Create a new certificate indicating the transferee as owner; and
(iii) Deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate.
(c) An application under paragraph (a) of this section or the creation of a certificate of title under paragraph (b) of this section is not by itself a disposition of the vessel and does not by itself relieve the secured party of its duties under State law.
§ 187.320
Transfer by operation of law.
(a) In this section—
(1) “By operation of law” means pursuant to a law or judicial order affecting ownership of a vessel—
(i) Because of death, divorce or other family law proceeding, merger, consolidation, dissolution, or bankruptcy;
(ii) Through the exercise of the rights of a lien creditor or a person having a lien created by statute or rule of law; or
(iii) Through other legal process.
(2) “Transfer-by-law statement” means a record signed by a transferee stating that by operation of law the transferee has acquired or has the right to acquire an ownership interest in a vessel.
(b) A transfer-by-law statement must contain—
(1) The name and last known mailing address of the owner of record and the
transferee and the other information required by § 187.307(b);
(2) Documentation sufficient to establish the transferee's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest;
(3) A statement that—
(i) The certificate of title is an electronic certificate of title;
(ii) The transferee does not have possession of the written certificate of title created in the name of the owner of record; or
(ii) The transferee is delivering the written certificate to the office with the transfer-by-law statement; and
(4) Except for a transfer described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence that notification of the transfer and the intent to file the transfer-by-law statement has been sent to all persons indicated in the files of the office as having an interest, including a security interest, in the vessel.
(c) Unless the office rejects a transfer-by-law statement for a reason stated in § 187.308(c) or because the statement does not include documentation satisfactory to the office as to the transferee's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest, not later than 20 days after delivery to the office of the statement and payment of fees and taxes payable under State law in connection with the statement or with the acquisition or use of the vessel, the office must—
(1) Accept the statement;
(2) Amend the files of the office to reflect the transfer; and
(3) If the name of the owner whose ownership interest is being transferred is indicated on the certificate of title—
(i) Cancel the certificate even if the certificate has not been delivered to the office;
(ii) Create a new certificate indicating the transferee as owner;
(iii) Indicate on the new certificate any security interest indicated on the canceled certificate, unless a court order provides otherwise; and
(iv) Deliver the new certificate or a record evidencing an electronic certificate.
(d) This section does not apply to a transfer of an interest in a vessel by a secured party as prescribed by State law related to security interests in goods.
§ 187.321
Application for transfer of ownership or termination of security interest without certificate of title.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in §§ 187.319 and 187.320, if the office receives, unaccompanied by a signed certificate of title, an application for a new certificate that includes an indication of a transfer of ownership or a termination statement, the office may create a new certificate under this section only if—
(1) All other requirements under §§ 187.307 and 187.308 are met;
(2) The applicant provides an affidavit stating facts showing that the applicant is entitled to a transfer of ownership or termination statement;
(3) The applicant provides the office with satisfactory evidence that notification of the application has been sent to the owner of record and all persons indicated in the files of the office as having an interest, including a security interest, in the vessel, at least 45 days have passed since the notification was sent, and the office has not received an objection from any of those persons; and
(4) The applicant submits any other information required by the office as evidence of the applicant's ownership or right to terminate the security interest, and the office has no credible information indicating theft, fraud, or an undisclosed or unsatisfied security interest, lien, or other claim to an interest in the vessel.
(b) The office may indicate in a certificate of title created under paragraph (a) of this section that the certificate was created without submission of a signed certificate or termination statement. Unless credible information indicating theft, fraud, or an undisclosed or unsatisfied security interest, lien, or other claim to an interest in the vessel is delivered to the office not later than 1 year after creation of the certificate, on request in a form and manner required by the office, the office must remove the indication from the certificate.
§ 187.322
Replacement certificate of title.
(a) If a written certificate of title is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or otherwise becomes unavailable or illegible, the secured party of record or, if no secured party is indicated in the files of the office, the owner of record may apply for and, by furnishing information satisfactory to the office, obtain a replacement certificate in the name of the owner of record.
(b) An applicant for a replacement certificate of title must sign the application, and, except as otherwise permitted by the office, the application must comply with § 187.307. The application must include the existing certificate unless the certificate is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable.
(c) A replacement certificate of title created by the office must comply with § 187.309 and indicate on the face of the certificate that it is a replacement certificate.
(d) If a person receiving a replacement certificate of title subsequently obtains possession of the original written certificate, the person must promptly destroy the original certificate of title.
§ 187.323
Rights of purchaser other than secured party.
(a) A buyer in ordinary course of business has the protections afforded by State law even if an existing certificate of title was not signed and delivered to the buyer or a new certificate listing the buyer as owner of record was not created.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in §§ 187.317 and 187.324, the rights of a purchaser of a vessel who is not a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lien creditor are governed by State law.
§ 187.324
Rights of secured party.
(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the effect of perfection and non-perfection of a security interest and the priority of a perfected or unperfected security interest with respect to the rights of a purchaser or creditor, including a lien creditor, is governed by State law.
(b) If, while a security interest in a vessel is perfected by any method under this subpart, the office creates a certificate of title that does not indicate that the vessel is subject to the security interest or contain a statement that it may be subject to security interests not indicated on the certificate—
(1) A buyer of the vessel, other than a person in the business of selling or leasing vessels of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer, acting in good faith and without knowledge of the security interest, gives value and receives possession of the vessel; and
(2) The security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the vessel that is perfected under § 187.315 after creation of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.

The information must be accessible by the hull identification number (HIN) for the vessel and any other methods provided by the office.
(c) If a person submits a record to the office, or submits information that is accepted by the office, and requests an acknowledgment of the filing or submission, the office must send to the person an acknowledgment showing the HIN of the vessel to which the record or submission relates, the information in the filed record or submission, and the date and time the record was received or the submission accepted. A request under this section must contain the HIN and be delivered by means authorized by the office.
(d) The office must send or otherwise make available in a record the following information to any person that requests it and pays the applicable fee:
