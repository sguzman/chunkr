§ 721.11431
Halogenated benzene alkylcarboxylic acid (generic) (P-19-92).
(a)
Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.
(1) The chemical substance identified generically as halogenated benzene alkylcarboxylic acid (PMN P-19-92) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The significant new uses are:
(i)
Protection in the workplace.
Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (iii), and (iv), (a)(3) through (6), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (
e.g.,
enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (
e.g.,
workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) as described in the TSCA Order for this substance. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(6), the airborne form(s) of the substance include particulate, gas/vapor, and combination gas/vapor and particulate. For purposes of § 721.63(b), the concentration is set at 1.0%.
(A) As an alternative to the respirator requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provision listed in the TSCA Order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.0273 mg/m
3
as an 8-hour time weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to § 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under § 721.30. Persons whose § 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA Order.
(B) [Reserved]
(ii)
Hazard communication.
Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (f) and (g)(1), (2), and (5). For purposes of § 721.72(e), the concentration is set at 1.0%. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: Skin irritation; respiratory complications; central nervous system effects; internal organ effects; reproductive effects; developmental effects; eye irritation. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(2), when using this substance: Avoid skin contact; avoid breathing substance; avoid ingestion; use skin protection; use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 0.0273 mg/m

. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.
(iii)
Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.
Requirements as specified in § 721.80(k), (q), and (t). It is a significant new use to manufacture or process the substance without including the engineering controls/processes described in the premanufacture notice.

(i)
Protection in the workplace.
Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (iii), and (iv), (a)(3) through (6), (b), and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (a)(4), engineering control measures (
e.g.,
enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (
e.g.,
workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 10.
